After starting to say goodbye, I looked up to the sky and noticed what were certainly not stars, nor common aircraft. I was amazed to see three, orangish-red, glowing triangles, flying in a triangular formation. Their speed seemed to be comparable to that of typical jets, however, there was absolutely no sound to be heard from this spectacle. They were in the northwestern sky, flying from west to east. I observed this for about two minutes, when then the light emitted from each source seemed to flicker slightly, then fade out - the front one first, then another, then the last one, until I saw them no more. I was incredibly excited and overwhelmed with curiosity after viewing this incredible and unexplainable sight."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-09142013-0006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/14/2013 04:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Lake Worth","There were no other sightings in Lake Worth on or around September 14th 2013"],"Latitude":"26.597512","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.597512,+-80.048468(50816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50816) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/14/2013 01:02 UTC","Summary":"3 bright orange triangles slowly moved across the sky in a triangle formation, then the light emitting from each slowly flickered & faded, one by one.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida"}
