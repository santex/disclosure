(i dont remember where that place is - somewhere west of the springs in the mountains) one night (around 11pm) there was a scientist there with a telescope and we were all looking at the rings of saturn, and it was my understanding from mrs, hall (my teacher) that this guy was from norad - and he was there to teach us some astronomy. when it was my turn to look at saturn, i noticed a light (fuzzy glow) off in the distance that was coming towards us and seemed very low -- no more than 50ft above the tops of the trees. it was moving very slow, and had no sound. i asked mrs, hall - \"what is that?\" she said it was a plane. i thought to myself that it was flying way too low to be a plane. as it got right on us (about 100 yards away) it stopped, and so did we -- it got very quite, even the crickets stopped chirping. then the object suddenly made a 90������ turn and started going east. it was moving very slow (no sound) it looked like a fuzzy tennis ball - with a soft white glow with no details to it. moments later it started to move upwards at a 45������ angle. the it started speeding up, and then it took off like 300 miles an hour, then even faster like a shooting star at that same 45������ angle -- straight back up into the atmosphere. i turned around to asked that guy (from norad) -- what just happened, what was that??? he was gone! he had raced down the hill back to his car and drove off -- leaving his telescope behind. the weird part about all of this -- no one thought that anything unusual had just happened - of course, we were all only 6th graders.... what do we know. but i was very observant of the event. when we got back to the city - i couldn't understand why no one wanted to talk about it. i was bugging mrs, hall about it - so being the artist that i am, she told me to draw a picture of it -- so i did... i made a very detailed storyboard. the next day, some man showed up and asked me if he could have the drawing.... so i gave it to him. he explained to me that it was a helicopter, and that was the end of that. mmmmm -- that was a very quite helicopter! the man took my drawing and left. mrs. hall told me to never talk about it again or i would be disciplined. so, i never gave it much thought after that - plus, as a 6th grader, i got distracted and moved on to something else anyway. but i never forgot about it, and its something i still think about to this day. i dont know why i feel compelled to talk about this now -- maybe because i think about it so much, i just have to share it and maybe someone else out there can relate."],"trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There was one other sighting in Colorado Springs on or around August 15th 1977"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.838982,+-104.812013(10579)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10579) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-104.812013","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10579.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10579.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10579.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Hoax","City":"Colorado Springs","Case Number":"10579","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04282008-0004","Latitude":"38.838982","Date Submitted":"08/15/1977 12:00 UTC"}
