I am about a mile to the Rt 44 exit when I look up and see two bright lights over the tree line to the left of me. I notice three beams of light coming from each bright light pointing to the ground and one light beaming directly into the sky from its center. I knew there was three lights although I couldn't see the third because of the three beams of light pointing down. On my way back down the highway about 25 min later I looked for it again and it was gone."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle"}
