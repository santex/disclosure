We use these markers much, but as of late the sky has been temporarily bench marked in the north, east, and south. Even, switching off as their departure. Being an army veteran of service during two wars, I have been many places, and am not really gullible. Trained, I now snap into an almost robot like state(photographic)under pressure.
