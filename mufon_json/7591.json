IN ADDITION TO THIS SIGHTING, MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHER WITNESSED A SIMILAR, UNREPORTED OBJECT APPROXIMATELY 6 YEARS AGO, HOWEVER THE OBJECT THAT SHE WITNESSED WAS TRIANGULAR. BOTH OBJECTS EMITTED NO SOUND. AS IN MY MOTHER'S INCIDENT, BOTH OBJECTS MOVED AT A STARTINGLY SLOW PACE. BOTH SIGHTINGS OCCURED AT FIVE THIRTY IN PRE-DAWN CONDITIONS. WEATHER WAS NOT AN ISSUE. BOTH SIGHTINGS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS AN OBJECT FLYING ONLY SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. I WAS NOT FEARFUL AND NEITHER WAS MY GRANDMOTHER. OUR FEELINGS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS BEING INCESSANTLY INTERESTING AND AN OBVIOUS ANOMALY. NEITHER OF US COULD EXPLAIN OR REASON WHAT OTHER OBJECT COULD BE RATIONALLY EXPLAINED, BUT COULD NOT. THE EXPERIENCE ONLY LASTED ABOUT 5 TO 6 MINUTES AND THE OBJECT JUST DIMINISHED FROM OUR VIEW."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"7591","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.197548,+-80.252826(7591)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7591) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None"}
