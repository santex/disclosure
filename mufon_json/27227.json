{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was about 11:45pm on January 1st, 2011 and I was outside of my house smoking a cigarette, enjoying the clear night sky and all of a sudden an orange glowing orb appeared from behind the trees. It was travelling from West to East and seemed to have a steady speed and a fairly high altitude, (maybe about as high as a commercial airliner, I'm not sure). As it passed over me I noticed that there was no sound coming from it, at least none that I could hear. I moved to a side street to keep sight of it as it travelled. From the time I first saw it to when it disappeared into the sky it seemed to maintain a straight path. At an arms length, it looked about as big as an eraser on a pencil. It was a glowing orange orb but when it was coming toward me I noticed a slight white blinking and when it passed me and I was looking at the back of it I noticed a slight red blinking. The whole event took about five minutes as it travelled across the sky."],"Summary":"I saw a round glowing orb travel across the sky.","Region":"Nebraska","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/03/2011 03:53 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.261903,+-95.989348(27227)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27227) map </A>","Longitude":"-95.989348","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"27227","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.261903","City":"Omaha","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27227.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27227.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around January 1st 2011"],"Date of the Event":"01/01/2011 11:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-01032011-0010"}
