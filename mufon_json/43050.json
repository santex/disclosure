About 3 outside of town she pointed out a extremely bright low light. At first it appeared to be hovering. As we got closer it started to slowly move southwest. The object was only 500 ft off of the ground. It had four lights in the shape of a diamond and had a bright light on the nose. As it was over us, we pulled over to watch it and my wife started to have contractions. (She is 35 weeks Prego) . This is not the first time we saw this object. About nine months ago we saw the same object at the same time, at the same place and same behavior."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"10/06/2012 12:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"{dr}diamond shape, at first it hovered with only one light andas it got closer appeared to have five lights that blinded randomly"}
