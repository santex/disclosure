{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home to yakima, wa from sunnyside wa on interstate 82 when i noticed a bright light about the size of the biggest star in the sky. I thought thats strange ive never seen that star there before and continued driving. 20 minutes later i noticed the exact same light about 60 degrees to the left and thought what the hell is going on. As i drove I couldnt help but just stare at this light, while staring at the light it abruptly vanished only to reappear 10 seconds later about 30 degrees to the right. At that point I had the chills and didnt kmow what it could possibly be. I watched it for another 12 miles til it went behind one the big hills over selah, wa. Dont know what it was but I really want to know what can move and vanish like that. Just to add there is a military training base in yakima wa, possibly it could have been a military test of some sort."],"Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.606521,+-120.499609(38159)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38159) map </A>","Longitude":"-120.499609","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38159.html"],"Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"05/13/2012 11:00 UTC","Latitude":"46.606521","City":"Yakima","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Yakima","There was one other sighting in Yakima on or around May 13th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-05152012-0010","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"38159","Summary":"Saw a floating light hover then move in a couple directions before floating away.","Date Submitted":"05/15/2012 01:46 UTC"}
