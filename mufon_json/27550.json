{"Case Number":"27550","divs":["Sighting Details It was 6:50 and I was walking to my friends car in the driveway. It was dark outside and the street lamp was on. I look up to see two lights. One red and the other green. The red light on the right seemed to have a round end but wasn't clearly visible. I noticed that there was no sound outside. When I step into the car I noticed that it was moving to the right very slowly. We kept driving and we were beside the etowah indian mounds and it seemed to bee hovering a couple hundred of feet above the tree line. That is when we got to the Pheonix airport for a class. Around 9:00 me and some friends were standing outside when we all see the two lights speed very quickly across the sky and dissapearing in about 2 seconds."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"34.169997","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two bright lights.
