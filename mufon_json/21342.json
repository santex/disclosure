{"Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"21342","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Port Hueneme","divs":["sighting detailsi stepped out my front door to check on some food i was cooking on the bar-b-q and as i looked up at the sky i saw a bright starlike object approaching from the south\\west. it was flying at an altitude that most of the propeller planes fly at but was moving quite rapidly. as it got closer i noticed 6 green lights, two on either side and two on what seemed like a tail but the odd thing was that all of the lights including the bright front light were all pulsing at the same time. as it passed overhead i was waiting for the rumble of a jet engine or the sound of a propeller buzzing in the air but it didnt make a sound i knew right then what i had just witnessed. this is the 2nd ufo i have seen"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Port Hueneme","There were no other sightings in Port Hueneme on or around January 3rd 2010"],"Date of the Event":"01/03/2010 06:20 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21342.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21342.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.150803","Summary":"Bright pulsating starlike object","Longitude":"-119.186807","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.150803,+-119.186807(21342)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21342) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01032010-0013","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"01/03/2010 10:11 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
