{"divs":["sighting detailsmy spouse and i saw some strange lights south\\southeast of breckenridge, texas, at 8:30 pm this evening. the lights were in the direction of eastland but possibly further south. i spent the last hour before dusk, planting beans and peas in our plowed field. i had just finished for the day and was standing at the ne corner of the field, with a clear 360 degree view of the sky. i was observing a few stars barely discernible above me when something made me look to my south. suddenly a bright white\\orange light appeared, then 4 more next to (east of) it. the four came on all at once. they all blinked off at the same time. these lights were approx. 10 degrees above the southern horizon. they lights only appeared for a few seconds each time. i ran to the house, yelling for my husband to \"come quick, ufos!\" (i didn't know what they were at the time, still don't). i grabbed my binoculars and by the time we got to the field, the lights were gone but as we stood there, a light appeared, then 3 more in a loose triangle formation. they all blinked out at the same time, then slightly further east they all appeared again. each time they blinked out, they would appear a bit further east until i could no longer see them because of the treeline. moments later, we saw at least 1 jet flying into that area and it was tiny in comparison to the lights. after the lights were gone, my husband said, \"what is that?\" he pointed up at about 65 -70 degrees ese and said, \"watch that star, it's moving.\" i watched it through the binoculars. i told him it was probably a satellite but then the object did something that satellites do not do, it altered course from ene to due east and then a few moments later, it disappeared. i contacted robert powell (mufon) and described what i had seen. we discussed it and he sent me a video of flares he had taken sometime earlier. my husband (a military aviation veteran) and i watched the video. the flares in the video did not resemble what we saw tonight. my husband is adamant that what we saw were not flares and i do not believe they were either. evidently we were not the only ones to see these lights tonight. i have a blog called \"lights in the texas sky\". a short while ago, someone posted to my blog what they also saw this evening and it matches very closely to what joe and i saw. here is their report\\comment: \"tonight 3\\31\\10 around eight thirty pm we saw about 10 flashing lights. it would appear for about 1-3 seconds as a bright orange light, dissapear for about the same time, then come back. but when it reappeared, rather than there only being one there would be multiple. this is about our forth time to see these things and we only see them at night but they are always the same thing. an orange light that flashes a few times then dissapears and we dont see it again the rest of the night.\" if i hear back from the poster, i will send any information to mr. powell. i am including in this report, 3 depictions of what joe and i saw. thank you, sw."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Several orange/white lights appear, then disappear everal times.","Log Number":"US-04012010-0006","Latitude":"32.758747","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22591.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22591_submitter_file1__03-31-2010_depiction1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22591_submitter_file2__03-31-2010_depiction2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22591_submitter_file3__03-31-2010_depiction3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22591.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Breckenridge","There were no other sightings in Breckenridge on or around March 31st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/31/2010 08:29 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Breckenridge","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Case Number":"22591","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.758747,+-98.89519(22591)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22591) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium, Light","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"04/01/2010 01:34 UTC","Longitude":"-98.89519","Disposition":"Unknown"}
