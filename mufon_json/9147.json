I was on Judson Rd about 5 minutes in a residental area. There were 4 lanes, 2 going east and 2 going west. I was driving on the inside lane going west. It was a clear nights with no haze in the sky. There was a car behind me traveling west and about 5-6 cars sizes behind me. The time was 1:16 AM. I had not been drinking and I was alert. A flash on my right side came from up above and dipped a little across my path. I saw a very bright cigar shaped light with a faint short tail speed extremely fast crossing my path then ascend up towards the clear sky and disappeared. The cigar shape object was so very bright. The car behind me pulled off to the shoulder of the road. I pulled off by a closed gas station and pulled out my binoculars but saw only the clear sky. Then I continued home since I was alone. I am not good at measurements of distances."],"Date Submitted":"01/20/2008 01:16 UTC","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"San Antonio","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01222008-0009","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9147.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9147.html"],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Flash, Teardrop","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.431772,+-98.490308(9147)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9147) map </A>","Latitude":"29.431772","Date of the Event":"01/20/2008 01:16 UTC"}
