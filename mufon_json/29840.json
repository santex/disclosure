It was going west to east tword New Jersey accross the normal flight paths for planes around here. It was like a star but much brighter. I watched it go slow and steady all the way across the sky, then as it got over Jersey it dimmed and vanished. Earlier tonight I was telling my wife about it and went out back for a smoke around 10:30 pm and saw it again! I was watching a plane going to Philly airport when my eye was caught by a moving star to the right. It then flaired up to the exact same brightness from 2 nights ago, and it wasn't a question I instantly new it was the same thing, then dimmed out and vanished right before my eyes."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.827613","Tags":"City","Case Number":"29840","Longitude":"-75.41436","Log Number":"US-07022011-0001","City":"Trainer","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29840.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29840.html"]}
