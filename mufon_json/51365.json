I took about 6 pictures of the sun setting and the clouds with my phone. When I looked at the photos later I noticed this glowing sphere. I did not see this with my naked eye....the sun was very bright as it set. This does not look like a sun glare to me because it seems to move in a clockwise circular manner. If you look at the photos in order and use the cloud formations as a reference piont......you can see that it moves. Also in the first and last photo there is a reddish aura around the glowing sphere. All I have are the photos....again I saw and heard nothing with my eyes. Not sure what this is?"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO Sphere in the Sunset?","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10072013-0012","Region":"California"}
