I was about a mile outside of Lawrence, KS, maybe 2000 feet east of the E 1750 Rd exit. I first noticed the object because it was floating in the sky in plain sight, within my eye-level. Originally, I thought the object was a dark grey balloon of some sort, and it did look rather soft or organic, but as I looked at it, I noticed no tether nor insignia. It stayed stationary in the sky, and was visible for a few minutes as I approached it. When I turned a bend, however, and looked back up, it was gone, and I could no longer see it from any of my windows. I found the whole experience quite strange, and felt a really odd sensation, like I was not supposed to see it or something. Like I had to look away."],"Date Submitted":"09/23/2011 05:25 UTC"}
