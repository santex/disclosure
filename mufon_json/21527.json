It faded in and out .The orb was changing colors from orange to red. It would stay on for 3 seconds fade out and reappear after 1 second. I watched it for a couple of minutes and setup my camera. The shutter speed was set for 8 seconds, the aperture was set on f5 and I believe the ISO was set either at 1600 or 3200. I took the picture and the object disappered. I did not hear any sounds or notice anything else strange. The object was north of my location was about 45 degrees. It was a clear cool night."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Witnessed an orange orb flashing on and off","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around January 10th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/17/2010 02:03 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-01172010-0003","Longitude":"-98.491398","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21527.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21527_submitter_file1__jan1010195.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21527.html"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"San Antonio","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.426022,+-98.491398(21527)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21527) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/10/2010 08:55 UTC"}
