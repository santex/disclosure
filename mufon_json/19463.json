{"Log Number":"US-09202009-0003","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Summary":"Telepathically initiated a sighting of a large mother-ship over my house. Similar formation found in earlier picture.","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn September 8, 2009 after reading up the Disclosure Project site and watching an interview with Steven Greer on the matter, basically saying that now it is time for people initiate the contact themselves (instead of waiting for a government disclosure) using certain mind techniques. I have telepathically asked for a contact and wanted to see not just a star like object (which I have seen 4-5 times this summer) but a giant ET ship, so no doubt is left. I needed a confirmation of my previous sighting, as well. So I was sending focused mental messages through out a day. Around 9 p.m. I heard some strange movement (best way I can describe it) outside the window. I had an urge to go check what was going on. When I walked out and looked up I saw a giant mother-ship type \"UFO\" (likely a cigar-shaped object) traveling slowly northbound at about 6,000-8,000 ft and well over 2-3 football fields in length, going over our house (one light after another in other in fixed formation. I ran in to the house breaking things on my way and called my mom. She ran out and also saw object passing over our heads. I said: mom they are here for us, they have arrived. The electrifying feeling went though our bodies. We started waiving and jumping in joy, asking them to stop for us. Indeed, the object stopped for a bit, seemingly posing for us, and then started turn with front going up. Then after hanging there for 30-45 seconds, first bottom (back) light dimmed out and then the brighter light followed the first and just disappeared in front of our eyes. The whole experience lasted no more than 2-3 minutes. A few days later, my mother found the picture of a similar formation, which was unknowingly was taken by my on August 25, in Devil���s Lake Wisconsin."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19463_submitter_file1__M16.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19463.html"],"Region":"Illinois","City":"Wheeling","Longitude":"-87.928959","Case Number":"19463","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.139193,+-87.928959(19463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19463) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 08:53 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 12:24 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Square, Rectagular, Unknown","Latitude":"42.139193","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Wheeling","There were no other sightings in Wheeling on or around September 8th 2009","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""]}
