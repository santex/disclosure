At first I thought it was a planet that I didn't notice before but it was far too bright and began moving north before fading away about thirty seconds later. Then about half a minute later I saw the same bright light appear from the west traveling very fast toward the east taking about 45 seconds to accomplish it's trip. The whole experience from beginning to end had my heart racing. I am an astronomer and often watch the stars and track satellites but both of these objects were far brighter than the ISS or any satellite I have ever seen and moved about as fast as a military jet. With both of these objects appearing in the exact same fashion at the same time leaves me suspicious that they could have been satellites or anything I am familiar with."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Crawfordsville","There were no other sightings in Crawfordsville on or around June 24th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"06/24/2010 11:15 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.868432","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Two bright lights in the sky - one going north and the other going west to east.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"23930","Latitude":"40.047294","Date Submitted":"06/25/2010 12:02 UTC"}
