Soon after the noises began I saw a strange object in the sky circling then making it way to a dried out lake bed where it descended to about 30 ft above the ground. It stayed there for about 10-15 min. It then took off straight into the sky. After it left I believe I saw what looked like a large humanoid in the moonlight across the lake from me, staring at me before slinking off into the woods."],"Date Submitted":"07/21/2013 12:11 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"03/11/2012 03:12 UTC","Log Number":"US-07212013-0014","Summary":"Object hovered over dry lake bed for 10 min","Region":"Georgia","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","Case Number":"49093","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.163975","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49093.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49093.html"]}
