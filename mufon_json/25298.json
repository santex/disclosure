I had dialed Jupiter in on the Telescope, and was showing the kids the moons, etc. While they were busy observing Jupiter I looked up directly over head, just to occupy myself and scan the sky. At this point I noticed, what I thought was two airplanes. However, after a few seconds I realized that these two objects were moving in synch with one another, one in front of the other. I asked my wife to look up to see this phenomena, which she did and was also able to see them. I was totally excited, and felt very hyper. They started to dim, I asked that she keep an eye on them while I ran to get my neighbor. I figured he was important as I know he has an interest in UFOs. By the time we got back, about 30 seconds later, my wife had said they faded out. They were moving in a Northern direction, almost due North, perhaps a little North East. I have no photos or videos."],"Latitude":"41.515452","Date Submitted":"09/04/2010 10:31 UTC"}
