{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at the Crow's Nest at the Santa Cruz marina with a friend having diner. I was taking pictures of the sunset, the view and the passing boats. I did not see the objects with my own eyes but did notice them later when I was reviewing the photos. The images where taken using and iPhone 4 and at no more than 50% zoom It is important to note that I feel the objects could be reflections in the glass but can't be certain of this. I leave it up to you to investigate. I hope it helps."],"Log Number":"US-09272011-0008","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.938574,+-121.996044(32131)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32131) map </A>","City":"Santa Cruz","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Santa Cruz","There were no other sightings in Santa Cruz on or around September 24th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"09/24/2011 06:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Other","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"36.938574","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/27/2011 02:31 UTC","Case Number":"32131","Tags":"City","Summary":"Object appears as a sliver of light","Longitude":"-121.996044","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32131.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32131_submitter_file1__IMG_1389.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32131_submitter_file2__IMG_1390.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32131.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California"}
