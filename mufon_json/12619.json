It was flying in and out of the clouds so we were able to get some idea of its size and speed. It was huge, aircraft carrier huge, and moving very fast. It was reported in the Pueblo news the next morning as a Russian Re-entry rocket, whatever that's supposed to be. I'm not a rocket scientist but I know the diference between a rocket falling and a craft flying horizontally across the sky. Besides that, what would a Russian rocket be doing over Oklahoma, Kansas, and eastern Colorado. I think that in itself would have generated serious cause for alarm! I'm pretty sure the Russians are not allowed to fly rockets over the midwestern United States. It was reportedly seen in all three states. It's been several years since the sighting so I don't remember dates but I know it was no rocket. It flew srtaight across the horizon and there was no sound, no exhaust, and no jet trail. That's what we saw."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09182008-0040","City":"La Junta","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-103.543832","Region":"Colorado"}
