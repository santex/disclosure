We were driving East on road 4 in Moses lake aproaching a stop sign intersecting west shore drive. bout 4 minutes later at 9:57 Approximately 300 feet in front of us was a big object (It was about the size of a military cargo plane)��� hovering��� slightly at an angle over Moses lake. It had 6 bright white lights it was the shape of a foot ball with one very noticeable bright light on the left. We thought that it landed but couldn't hear anything so we drove approx. 100 feet closer to the water and it vanished. It made no sound or wind. We thought it was really strange because we didn't know what we were seeing. My brother saw red lights on the craft. I did not. (we saw the same thing differently) We are boggled and looking for answers!"],"Log Number":"US-07132010-0018","Case Number":"24490","Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"07/12/2010 09:58 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.137062,+-119.268777(24490)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24490) map </A>","Longitude":"-119.268777","Latitude":"47.137062","Object Shape":"Oval","Summary":"We saw a huge football shaped craft with 6 white lights hovering just above the water 300 feet from us.","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Moses Lake","There were no other sightings in Moses Lake on or around July 12th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Moses Lake","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24490.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24490.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
