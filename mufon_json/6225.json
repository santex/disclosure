Int. Airport and was swinging around to head on a Northwest heading taking it pretty much right over my head.I did not see any lights associated with the object and it looked like a fuselage of dull grey with no wings.It did not reflect the sunlight,which was very bright at the time.The other thing I remember was that it appeared to be starting to bank to the South and that is why I was looking for shadows of wings or a tail when it \"disappeared\" from full view,still at the approximately 11:00 position."],"trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around January 24th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6225.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6225.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Albuquerque","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/24/2007 09:13 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.089921,+-106.646197(6225)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6225) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"New Mexico","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.089921","Longitude":"-106.646197"}
