It appeared to be staying at the same altitude it was slower than a meteor but faster than any plane. I am reporting this because it was just so bizaare. There was some very thin clouds but you could still see alot of stars i lost sight of it cause of the tree's in my yard to the west It was just really cool ...."],"Date of the Event":"09/02/2013 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"50385","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Egg, Flash, Oval, Sphere","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sutherlin","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"I was just standing out on the back patio and was looking at the stars......","Latitude":"43.400655","City":"Sutherlin","Date Submitted":"09/03/2013 03:37 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09032013-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50385.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50385.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Oregon","Source":"MUFON"}
