This is a flight path for Long Beach Intl airport however this was different from other aircraft lights. The object slowly changed color from red to gold. Still thought it could be aircraft, but then observed it descend into the ocean. We thought perhaps a plane crashed, however there has not been any reports since. I observed it with binoculars, however could not make out any details, other than the lights changing. Still, was able to view it descend, and descend against the background of the Seal Beach pier - watched it pass behind and under in its distance, and disappear around the ocean level. It was dark at night however no other splash or crash was observed. It was fairly far away, perhaps a mile."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45205.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.720458,+-118.114976(45205)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45205) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-01142013-0014","Latitude":"33.720458"}
