When it was over I was getting the kids in the car and every one else went inside except my wife. As I turned I saw from the corner of my eye I saw a light and quickly looked up thinking that it was a firework. But instead it was a white ball of light flying across the sky and first thing that I thought it was that it was an airplane. But it was flying real smoothly and quietly. It was far enough that it should have been heard. It continued across the sky at the same speed not too fast and I just watched until it just faded away and disappeared. It just vanished. I thought it went behind clouds but it was a clear sky no clouds. I wish I could have recorded it."],"Latitude":"40.9805"}
