{"Object Features":"None","Summary":"Solid light traveling fast and high over NAS Whidbey","Longitude":"-77.029526","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside looking at the stars at 1130. I noticed several small aircraft in the area. They had the usual stobe lights an the were all flying under the clouds. I spotted a solid white light light traveling SW to NE. It had no flashing lights. It appeared to be the same size as the aircraft in the area, but it was moving very fast. It was also much higher than the aircraft. It eventually passed out of sight above the clouds. It was not a meteor. There was no tail. I don't think it was a satellite because the ones I've seen are kind of tumbling and reflecting light. There was no aircraft from NAS Whidbey flying either."],"Log Number":"US-07182011-0002","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around July 16th 2011"],"Latitude":"38.900842","Region":"Washington","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/16/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"30237","Date Submitted":"07/18/2011 01:27 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30237.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30237.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","City":"Washington","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.900842,+-77.029526(30237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30237) map </A>"}
