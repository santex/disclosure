{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have hesitated to report what I have seen for several reasons, the first being that at the time of the incident, I was still employed by a local law enforcement agency and I felt that going public with this might not be accepted by that agency in a positive way. But after being encouraged by my friends and family I have finally decided to report what I witnessed. I am now retired and don't really care how they might feel about it. I think it's about time I reported a rather unusual event that happen a few years ago. I observed what I know to be a UFO, being escorted by three military planes. One low flying military jet, I believe to have been a wart hog, flying at about 1000 ft. off the deck, followed about two minutes later by an extremely large triangular shaped object, totally blacked out and totally silent. That object was also flying at what I believe to be a very low altitude. Approximately two minutes later, two more military planes appeared from the same direction. They were also flying as slow as possible, at the same altitude and direction as the first jet, and the UFO. It was early fall, on a crystal clear and perfectly calm night. There was no moon out at that time. I was bow hunting in an area that I was very familiar with, just southwest of Cascade Idaho. I had taken my four wheeler about a half mile from camp, to a high point along a logging road, a place we call phone point. At that location we are able to get satisfactory reception for cell phone operation. I had been sitting there for a few minutes, just taking in the crisp clean air, admiring the awesome view of the sky filled with what looked like a million stars. I was listening to all the sounds of the high mountains and enjoying the moment as I waited until I could get a little better reception on my phone. I then noticed, coming from the south, just over the tree tops, what appeared to be an A-10 Wart Hog. It was flying at a very low speed and altitude; it looked as though it was barely going fast enough to stay in the air. I could see it clearly as it passed almost directly overhead. The plane appeared to be tilted back on its tail with the nose elevated and the engines sounded like they were running at an increased power level in order to maintain altitude. It didn't look as though it was more than 800 to 1000 ft. off the ground, maybe even lower. I remember watching it slowly continue north bound and remember looking at the rear engines and the roar from them, I could see the bright blue flame shooting from the exhaust ports. I just sat there for a couple of minutes, wondering to myself what that was all about. Then, it came; I was still facing the same direction, south, sitting on my four wheeler. I could see that against the star filled sky, a large area was beginning to just disappear; the stars were beginning to black out. In a huge triangular shape, with a point in the lead, the area being blacked out grew larger and larger. Blocking out over two thirds of the sky as it passed almost directly over my head. I was stunned, to say the least. Although I look back on it now and I wonder why I wasn���t scared, but at the time I had no fear, just amazement and curiosity. I could see, as it passed slowly overhead, the trailing edge of the huge triangular shape as the stars began to reappear. It was so big, blocking out so much of the sky, I kept expecting to hear something, some engine sound, something, but it was totally silent. From the overall size I knew it had to be close to the ground, it just was not reasonable for an object of that incredible size to be that close to the ground and not make any sort of noise. Not a sound of any kind, just a huge black triangular shaped object, directly overhead, moving very slowly. No sound and no lights of any kind. I kept thinking that I should be able to see some kind of engine exhaust, some kind of lights or sound, but nothing. It then disappeared over the tree tops on the ridge to the north, just like the first jet. Again, I just sat there, thinking about what I had just seen. I was going over and over it in my mind, I wanted to memorize the entire event. I had been trained to do that in 20 years of law enforcement and I'm able to remember unusual events in most every detail possible. Then, just as suddenly as the first two objects, there appeared two more military jets, flying side by side. They both also appeared to be A-10's. Both flying at very low altitude and very slowly, just like the first one. They were following the exact same heading as the first jet and the black triangle shaped object. In all three instances it took approximately 30 to 45 seconds for the objects to pass overhead. I would estimate that the distance covered was approximately one half mile from the time they came into view until they disappeared over the ridge to the north. I sat there for several minutes, thinking about what had just happened. I am positive of the facts as they occurred. I have no explanation, but there are only a couple of possible scenarios as I see it. To me, it's obvious that the military jets were an escort, one to lead and two to follow. Were they aware of the large triangular object in the middle, yes of course they were. I guess the obvious question would be, was the object military or from some other source? I seriously doubt that it was ours. It was some sort of collaboration between the military and that other source, what ever or who ever it is. This was nothing less than an amazing event that I will never forget; I hope this account of military participation will help shed some light on other unexplained sightings similar to this one."],"Longitude":"-116.041798","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"44.516282","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"9463","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9463.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.516282,+-116.041798(9463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9463) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-02062008-0006","Region":"Idaho","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Cascade","There were no other sightings in Cascade on or around September 13th 2003"],"Date Submitted":"09/13/2003 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"A huge, totally silent, totally blacked out triangle passed directly overhead at appromimatly 500 ft. being lead and followed by three military airplanes.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Cascade","Date of the Event":"09/13/2003 12:00 UTC"}
