{"divs":["Sighting DetailsLast year on June 29 and 30, I reported strange lights in the visual light spectrum. Re: a report this evening, report number 41801, that is EXACTLY what I saw, which may have been over the Connersville area as I can see it from my bedroom window, due to farms behind me. The person reporting took a picture in Laporte and it is identical to what I witnessed two nights in a row. When I did witness them, I had the biggest feeling for both fascination and dread. These lights were revolving in a counterclockwise motion. Not sure if that is what the Laporte witness saw, but it went on for about minutes both nights and I then got sleepy. It was between 3 and 3:30 am. I am glad someone got a picture of it, as it was difficult to describe, only that it was the full visible light spectrum or ROYGBIV. My background is in the Earth and Space Sciences, by the way."],"Latitude":"39.643505","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Liberty","There were no other sightings in Liberty on or around June 29th 2011"],"Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"41819","Longitude":"-84.927651","Date of the Event":"06/29/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Re: MUFON Report 41801","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-08172012-0017","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41819.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41819.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/17/2012 11:14 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.643505,+-84.927651(41819)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41819) map </A>","City":"Liberty","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
