I remember my Dad saying it looked like a chopper. But then when the lights changed color he didn't know what it was. It also had no sound to it. All of the family were getting excited about it because it was so close to us. But I can't remember anything else from that night except my uncle would not sleep by himself. Later on my family said something about what looked like a bolt of lighting going down the valley but I don't remember that. As I was too young."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Strawberry","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22513.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22513.html"]}
