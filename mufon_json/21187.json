I happened to look up and spotted a twinkle in the sky. I looked with more intensity and spotted 2 spherical objects which seemed to be moving in a cat and mouse way. I knew then that these were not airplanes, bugs, or delusions. One looped quickly around the other and then slowly faded behind the trees in the distance. They seemed to fly completely straight and together after a few seconds of me spotting them. The event lasted very briefly. One object was extremely reflective in that it caught my eye at a very high altitude. I had my phone with a built in camera and took a picture but it was just too high up."],"Log Number":"US-12272009-0011","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"12/27/2009 12:28 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/27/2009 01:28 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21187.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21187.html"],"City":"Cary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.79554,+-78.774317(21187)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21187) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
