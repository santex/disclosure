I figured it was a planet. I hadn't seen it before so I stared for about a minute, then it disappeared and a faint light appeared. The light was shaking erradically all around the area for about 3 minutes, I ran outside and watched as it then stabilized itself and started flying over my area. The UFO was a triangle shape and a light would flash on one point, then the next, then the third. Two of the lights were normal colored and the other was red. As I watched that one I looked past it and saw another light flashing erradically, got a little spooked, and went inside. But before I went inside I saw another bright light and figured it was a star, I just looked out the window and its gone. I didn't lose sight, I was just spooked."],"Date of the Event":"03/27/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"6674","Log Number":"US-03282007-0002","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6674.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6674.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.014231,+-121.801179(6674)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6674) map </A>","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Antioch","There were no other sightings in Antioch on or around March 27th 2007"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
