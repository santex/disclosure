I was looking up at the sky (have seen ufos in the past). Object was observed to be in a stationary position. Unlike a bird which ride a wave of air, this thing was not wavering. I would notice a reflection about every 3 to 5 seconds coming from the side of it that faced the sun. I did not panic, I just continued to feel that I was relatively safe, as I have seen this before. I looked at the street to see if anyone else was around so I could get them to look at it. Nobody was near. I looked up again and it was gone. I went west about six miles home after work and saw it again at 3:30 pm EDT. I then used binoculars. I appeared to to have small points and was hovering under a cloud. Close up view revealed it appeared to be a flat object and was rotating end over end. It lasted 20 minutes and disappeared."],"Date Submitted":"05/06/2012 04:26 UTC","Latitude":"39.118159","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"hovering object appears just below cloud level.","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.118159,+-84.500069(37964)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37964) map </A>","City":"Cincinnati","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37964.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37964_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37964.html"],"Case Number":"37964","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Region":"Ohio"}
