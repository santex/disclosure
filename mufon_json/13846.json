I went outside and over the phone we kind of established where I should be looking. It took a few minutes as I live in a somewhat wooded area, but I did see one spotlight light through the trees. With my newphew still on the phone, I got into my car and started to go down my driveway, which is long, on the way down the drive, I got a great view of the lights..it seemed as if there was one large light and several, if not what I told my newphew was it looked light hundreds of smaller, less intense lights, he agreed. I continued to drive, but at around 9pm I lost sight of it and went back home. I was the third or fourth person my newphew contacted, my newphew lives about 10 miles away from me, I live in Montgomery County, but the lights we in the direction of Bucks County. I was glad to see that others have reported the same."],"Latitude":"40.353993","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Sellersville","Summary":"Lights, seeming to come from the sky, like a spot light pointing down","Case Number":"13846","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.304898","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
