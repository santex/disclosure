It went slowly across the sky and I had to keep blinking to keep track of it. I watched closely because it looked as if it were going to hit a star and then it veered and the was gone. A few minutes later I saw an airplane (flashing red and green lights going north). I found this website when I googled to see if all airplanes have flashing colored lights or had to have flashing lights period because this did not flash. this is probably nothing but I thought I would share."],"Case Number":"51129","Summary":"{nd} bright light going across sky...seemed to be further than some stars","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Middletown","There were no other sightings in Middletown on or around September 27th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-84.348843","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51129.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51129.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/27/2013 09:24 UTC"}
