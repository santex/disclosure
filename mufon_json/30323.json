{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs we were fishing at Santa Ana River Lakes in Anaheim, CA near the 91 and 55 freeway interchange we looked to the night sky when a low flying triangle shaped object with lights on each point caught both mine and my wifes eye. It was silent and seemed to just glide in the night sky. It was headed in the diraction of the ocean and came from the mountain area. It was close to the size of a passenger jet. It was not very bright though. I would say it was like a light bulb on a dimmer switch about half way turned down yet still very visible. You could see that it was very clearley a triangle and that it had some substance to it. As it flew closer to us the lights looked like rectangle shaped, then when it was right above us we could see that they were squaire, then as it flew past is and we keep looking at it the front light went out of sight being that the craft was level to the sky only leaving the two back lights of the rectangle shapes visible, then they to went out of sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.912834","Case Number":"30323","Latitude":"33.839913","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There was one other sighting in Anaheim on or around July 23rd 2011"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 05:11 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/23/2011 11:06 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","City":"Anaheim","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.839913,+-117.912834(30323)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30323) map </A>","Summary":"Dimely light triangle shaped craft with three lights on it flew over head","Log Number":"US-08092011-0117","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30323.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30323.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
