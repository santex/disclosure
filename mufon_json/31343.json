I really did not think anything of it until I observed this light then immediatley turn red, then green and blue. As I was coming up to the light on Park Springs I observed the object fly over me where I notice that it was not an airplane and was more cigar shaped. I then turned around to try and follow the object but by the time that happened which was a matter of seconds, the object was already gone."],"Summary":"UFO over I20 in Arlington, TX","Date of the Event":"08/30/2011 11:10 UTC","City":"Arlington","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"31343","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-97.100396","Date Submitted":"08/31/2011 01:32 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08312011-0006","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
