I'm not trying to be a know it all but I too have seen this thing, the very first time I saw it, I was almost hit by a car because I walked right out into a street in disbelief. Told my wife then a few nights later we both got to see it. Turns out there are two pretty decent sized blimps used for advertising that take off from North Las Vegas Airport and fly all around the valley and on the sides of these blimps are huge L.E.D. screens used for ads. I have seen people almost wreck their cars watching this thing. I personally beleive in UFO's but from what you reported this is what I thought of. Not sure how long you've lived here but hope it helps."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32760.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32760.html"],"Summary":"To the other NV report","Object Shape":"Blimp","Object Features":"Unknown"}
