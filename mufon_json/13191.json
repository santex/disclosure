I was driving on the north loop by tractor supply. To me left, high enough to be a plane, I saw yellow lights. The color was yellow the entire time. I saw about 6 lights on this side, it was shaped like a disc. The lights were rotating around the disc. This is what made me think it as not a plane due to the rotation. Then no lights. Moments later the lights were blinking randomly. The lights then disappeared for good. I notice two other cars pulled over watching as well. It was moving slowly."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/23/2008 08:33 UTC","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 6 other sightings in Stephenville on or around October 23rd 2008"],"Case Number":"13191","Summary":"yellow lights","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10232008-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13191.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13191.html"],"Latitude":"32.227906","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","City":"Stephenville","Longitude":"-98.197723","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.227906,+-98.197723(13191)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13191) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
