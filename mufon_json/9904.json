I turned a corner and saw the object hovering at what was just a little above my eyeline. I guess I just slammed on my breaks and my car died (I have a standard, so I might not have pressed the clutch. I don't remember if I did or not) and couldn't do anything but stare at it. To say I was shocked is an understatement. I was also a little scared, but also a little in awe of it. It had lights around the edges that showed it to be triangle like. I think it was only a couple of minutes that it hovered before moving to my left, then turning sharply and shooting upwards and disapeared."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/08/2008 09:30 UTC","City":"Black Rock","Log Number":"US-03102008-0012","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
