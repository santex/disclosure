I often leave my curtain open at night to see the light's of the city. I was about to go to bed when I noticed a strange glowing light hoover in one place far above the city. I originally thought it was a helicopter but I noticed it stayed perfectly still as the light coming from it began to brighten. From the elevation above the city it was pretty clearly not a helicopter to me because there would be no way the light would reach the area below. It stayed in spot for about a couple minutes and the light appeared to slowly dissipate to where I almost couldnt see it anymore, and then it in a split second appeared far brighter than it had been originally and what ever it was shot upwards at an amazing high rate of speed I have seen any helicopter ever be able to move any where close to the speed it reached as it shot up."],"City":"Hayward","Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.074296","Summary":"Strange glowing light that rapidly flew up words","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"40788","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Hayward","There were no other sightings in Hayward on or around July 9th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"37.67443","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.67443,+-122.074296(40788)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40788) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/14/2012 05:22 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/09/2012 02:15 UTC"}
