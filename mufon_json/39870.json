I saw an orb on the left horizon,tree top level, moving quickly in a straight line, with my car. I could not say how far away it was, or how large it was.it moved like this for 5 to6 seconds, then shot downwards in front of us on the left side at an angle so fast-it created a trail. We thought it must have crashed,because it was so close to the ground. When we reached the area that we assumed it had crashed, nothing was there. Afterward. both of us marveled at how calm we were and how we did not question the event while it was happening."],"Date of the Event":"06/19/2012 03:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown"}
