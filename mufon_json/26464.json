I was watching TV. He said it was moving. I ran to the window saw it and we both went on the balcony to watch it. We have both seen objects before this that were unusual and it was at night. This was the first time we saw something in the day. It was a bright shiny silver object in the sky - far in the distance. My husband said that it was moving. It appeared to be going bright than I could barely see it and it continue like that the entire time. We both looked at it with our binaculars. It looked like there was a red light that was moving on it. It stayed stationary for a while and then it traveled in a easterly course. I took a few pictures and can see something in one - if you zoom in close you can see it. I watched it for about 20 minutes until it moved out of my sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11092010-0013","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around November 9th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"husband saw object in sky and showed me - I saw it for about 20 minutes","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
