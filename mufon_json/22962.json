I did not think anything of it at first and thought it was a plane. But as I kept driving and getting closer I knew from the BRIGHT glow that it was not a plane. ( I lived next to O'HARE airport for 25 years) The object appeared to be on the North side of the road. It was hard to tell how high up it was ( did not appear to be very high ) or what shape the object was due to the fact of the BRIGHTNESS of the object. For some reason I did not pull over right a way but when I did and began looking for the object again I could not see it. There was no sound no vapor no nothing. A few days later I talked with some people I work with and one reported seeing a very bright object in the sky a few hours earlier. And the other said they saw a very bright object in the night sky moving the next day."],"Log Number":"US-04252010-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22962.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22962.html"],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pagosa Springs","There were no other sightings in Pagosa Springs on or around December 25th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"12/25/2009 04:30 UTC","Case Number":"22962","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Saw a VERY BRIGHT Gold object in sky","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.27238,+-107.007682(22962)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22962) map </A>"}
