I panned the skies for another hour I wanted to explain it before I went to bed couldn't find it. However I noticed a lot of what appeared to be satellites (white dots, star like) zipping across the sky in all directions it seemed every few minutes another one would cross the viewfinder path moved to quickly to see through telescope so I grabbed my binoculars some would disappear or fade out before 15* to horizon other would make it all the way asuuming they continued I can only follow to about 5 degrees. still curious I grabbed my night vision Single Scope made in Russia night Owl optics Give a pretty big view plus 10 x 35 mag. I haven���t found away to take pics through it but will come up with something what i saw was pretty amazing, I aimed into the sky ( above my head) then flipped on infa-red within a minute I began seeing moving white dots (all stars look like white dots through the night vision some lager then others, lots of them) I was telling myself this must be normal a lot of debris up there NORAD claims to be track like 9000 pieces perhaps it was the suns reflection hitting this debris? I don���t know, will invest in a night vision camera.."],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Summary":"4 Flashing Orbs Green Blue red white rotating fast","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"11469","Log Number":"US-07072008-0010","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Temecula","There were no other sightings in Temecula on or around July 6th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"California","Source":"MUFON"}
