I view the evening skies every night and am accustomed to seeing at least one \"planetary star\", but this one directly below the one I usually see. It hasn't moved. Just thought it was peculiar that it appeared suddenly tonight. Apparently, I am not the only one to notice. Others have called into MUFON reporting it, as I called as well. While the \"usual star\" gets obscured by the clouds, the other one below it seems to brighten intensely as the other one dims.
