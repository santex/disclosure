It was still dark out. I'm heading south down M100 towards the highway and traffic was very light, almost none existent going down this stretch of road. A lot of the stores opened around 4am, some midnight, so I figured I missed a majority of the shopping traffic. About a good 3 miles before the highway I see a bright, bright, bright, huge white light low in the sky towards the direction I was heading (south). It was too big to be a planet, or a star, satellite, plane, or helicopter and it just sat there in the same spot the entire 3 miles I drove to get to the highway. I mean it didn't move at all. It stayed in the same exact spot. I take this road everyday, and this light was with out a question...out of the norm. By the time I got to the highway bridge (I 96), this thing was just a huge beacon low in the sky. There was no way anyone could miss it because not only was it huge, it was low, very, very low in the sky. There wasn't a lot of traffic in this area, but there was some, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out why NOBODY was stopping their cars to look at this thing. I mean it was right there as big as life just sitting there in the air behind McDonalds in an empty farm field not moving at all. With my camera ready that I pulled out of my purse, I wasn't taking the highway, even if I was going to be late for work, instead I went up one road and took Grand river heading east. I made my left turn onto Grand river and since that road was empty, no traffic, I didn't pull into the McDonalds right there because of the parking lot lights, instead I drove past it to the edge of the farm field and slowed down onto the shoulder with my camera ready to go and there it was just sitting there in mid air. It was just a big, kind of oblong, bright, bright, bright while light. I was looking out my passenger window at it and didn't even get my car to a stop and this huge object just took off and started booking east, just like that, and that's when I seen it was a triangle as it got further from me. It was now heading in the same direction I was going (east) so I pulled back onto the road and sped up to try and catch it. It wasn���t directly over the road, but moving along right next to it on my right side. This triangle was so low, and just so huge in size I was half expecting it to take a couple tree tops out. Now I'm driving down Grand river after this thing, watching it through my windshield, but I just wasn't fast enough to catch up to it. By the time I passed Granger landfill I seen it move across Grand river in front of me, still very, very low, now heading west. It dwarfed the oncoming cars headlights big time. If you were to take the Flyin J���s building length wise and hang it over the road, that���s how big it was. 5 seconds later, when I got to Fl yin' J's gas station it was gone. Just like that it was gone. I looked everywhere, every part of the sky because it was a good clear, distance view all around. It was just gone. I just don't get why NOBODY else stopped? It was right there as big as life and NOBODY stopped. How could they have not seen it? I didn't get a picture or video. The camera was right there in my hand, but I was so busy just looking at it through my windshield and driving at the same time there just wasn't time. Note...there is a small National Guard base in that area, so it may be one of their triangle craft's I seen, but then again I'm not sure if that base would even have those types of craft. I made a drawing, but it is weak in comparison to seeing the actual thing up close and personal."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"11/23/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"8495","trends":["There have been no other sightings in GrandLedge","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
