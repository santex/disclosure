Three stars were aligned with two being very close together. I looked away at the dogs and then back up and noticed that the bright one in that group was moving. A fleeting thought crossed my mind that if that thing come this way I am running for the house. The light moved East, then South. When the light flew to the South, it didn���t change in size and it moved rather quickly. I ran back inside to get my camera to record it and when I came back out I did not find it to the Southeast where I was expecting it to be (say if it was a plane flying to El Paso). I saw what looked like two observatories on the mountain. I usually only see one light up in the Eastern horizon. It was then that the light disappeared behind the mountain range. The light that I saw was almost as bright as Venus is in the morning. I have been out here with the dogs several mornings a week for the past 2 years and I have never seen anything like this. I know that the double helicopters fly in this area but I didn���t hear anything and the neighborhood dogs were not barking."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Alamogordo","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.907672,+-105.953655(43003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43003) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/03/2012 07:59 UTC","Tags":"City"}
