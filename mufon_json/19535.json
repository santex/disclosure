I noticed later as i reviewed the movie what appears to be an object a few seconds into the footage, you will notice it in the middle. Of course i realise i am behind glass and that it can reflect whats behind me or a chip in the glass maybe. I am sending you the raw footage, no alterations has been made, i'm hoping you can work out what it is as i dont have any editing software and means to analyze it myself.
