I was walking my dog in our neighborhood. 2. I check sky movement while taking evening walks. I counted five conventional aircraft during our walk, which is not uncommon. Various stars were visible despite city light pollution. 3. The object in question looked suspiciously like a classic orb. 4. When first observed, it appeared as a bright star moving north over-head at a casual speed similar to other aircraft observed this evening. However, its light intensity increased dramatically a few seconds after I spotted it, almost in sync with my attention (at least twice its original intensity and much brighter than any star, size appeared to increase). As it continued on its northly path, it appeared to veer and shift speed slightly. 5. I get an adrenaline boost when I perceive something out of the ordinary. This observation was perceived out of the ordinary. 6. Soon after it gained light intensity, this object began to fade as an aircraft entered my line of vision heading south. This aircraft had conventional lighting and passed below the observed object. The observed object faded out within a matter of seconds, and I did not see it reappear."],"Date of the Event":"08/27/2012 11:25 UTC","Case Number":"42090","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/28/2012 12:57 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.868217","Summary":"Observed steady starlike orb moving north","Log Number":"US-08282012-0002","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Latitude":"40.392994","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Lafayette","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Lafayette","There were no other sightings in Lafayette on or around August 27th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42090.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42090.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
