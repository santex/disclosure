It was flying low no higher than 250 feet any aircraft would have been audible at that altitude. It had a very bright steady orange light that was not blinking like the standard flashing light a plane or helocopter would have. At the time I was outside smoking and noticed it as I looked up. I know a lot about planes and helpcopters and know their capabilities and that was definatly not anything I've seen. My girlfriend also witnessed the event and she has come to the same conclusion. The sky was clear and the UFO was flying at an angle so it could not have been a falling star. I lost sight of the object after it went beyond visual range. It's speed was about that of a small military jet but as I said any plane or helocopter would have made noise at the altitude it was travelling."],"Date of the Event":"09/26/2008 10:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Clio","There were no other sightings in Clio on or around September 26th 2008"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09262008-0018","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12798.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12798.html"],"Case Number":"12798","Summary":"The object was moving at high speed and flying no higher than 250 feet"}
