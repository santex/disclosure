Suddenly the light stopped moving and seemed to hover, then proceeded to go back to the west. It then started blinking on and off, then disapperead completly, only to come back on as a solid light still moving back to the west. Then it started moving back to the east. I got my wife and son out to see the object. it would move to the east, back to the west, some up and down, some solid light sometimes blinking. It was normally a bright green, but would fade to an orangesish color. this went on for apx. 15 minutes.
