I think it was east, but is is a countryroad with many S curves and goes many directions, but the general path is East. I was driving, my brother was in the passenger seat, and my girlfriend was inthe back seat, behind me on the drivers side. My car is a 2003 VolkswagenJetta, which comes with this Monsoon sound system, the only reason I mention itis that it might be able to explain the error message the LCD screen was givingme, as I have never seen it. We were listening to a CD which suddenly stoppedand there was a loud beep, and the LCD screen dimmed and said No CD. Theinstrument and head lights also dimmed, kind of wavering between dim and dimmer. I thought maybe I was having a battery or alternator problem. I wanted to pullover, but it was a new car, I was going 55, and there was no shoulder on thisroad, so I started slowing down, but then we all started to hear a really deeppulsating sound, that had an effect much like when you are ascending in aairplane, filling the ears.
