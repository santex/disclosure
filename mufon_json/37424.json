When it suddenly got really hot and it was around 11 at night and freezing before so this was unusual. We start talking about things when a helicopter flies by very close to the ground with its search lights on we thought this was very strange so we kept walking. It got very hot again and we saw something moving in the sky so as we stare at it, The colors are a light bluish green and it had flashing yellow and almost purple flashing objects behind it as we stared it ran across the sky and stopped abrubtly to a halt as we stare directly at it, it stays that way for another 5-7 minutes then shoots off past us."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"37424","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/02/2012 11:14 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37424.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37424.html"],"Longitude":"-106.40671","Date Submitted":"04/12/2012 11:49 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Casper","There were no other sightings in Casper on or around March 2nd 2012"],"Summary":"At first looked like meteor but then stopped in its path and hovered","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.825216,+-106.40671(37424)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37424) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
