In the last picture, a UFO is hovering above the buildings in central Nashville city. Wasn't 4 seconds earlier in picture I took before that. It's huge & from what i've seen, the Best picture of a UFO above a city ever taken. I still have the picture in my camera to prove it's not a fake. I'm not sending it on this site where it can be claimed by who knows who. I'm calling around to see who wants to examine my photo & camera. Let me know if you are interested. This is no bullshit, I host a show on Discovery Channel, which is why I don't give out my address. Call or e-mail me anytime.
