It was around 10 pm, we were headed West and right over mountain we noticed a huge crescent moon. We all gasped because it was so pretty, the sort where you see the bright crescent part and the rest of the shadowed part. I wanted to take a picture of it. One of the family members then said that the moon was in the wrong spot, that is should have been over us and not on the horizon. And then we realized that it was in the wrong phase because the actual moon was full. It began to \"set\" over the mountain, and within seconds it disappeared completely. We were all pretty stunned and pretty certain we'd seen some sort of atmospheric rarity or weather pattern but I have no idea what kind. My sister and I continued to drive around the area after dropping off the third car member but we couldn't find it anymore."],"Region":"Colorado","Summary":"Saw a \"false crescent moon\" over the mountains when it shouldn't have been there, and it was not in the right phase of the actual moon.","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Golden","There were no other sightings in Golden on or around July 24th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
