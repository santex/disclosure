{"Log Number":"US-03212013-0003","City":"Los Angeles","divs":["Sighting DetailsLast night I was driving up Christy Ave about to turn left onto Jimenez noticed an object with 2 very bright green and one red light above the hills at the very top of Christy Ave. I slammed on my brakes and kept watching and it was sporadically moving back and forth above the mountains very very quickly, must have been going about 100 miles per hour. At first I thought it was a helicopter but the lights didn't blink at all and were very bright, and the object was moving way too fast above the mountains. A car drove up behind me so I drove down my street and got out of my car and could still see it further west above the mountains behind Kurt Street. I ran into my house to get my mom to look at the object as well and when she came outside it was gone. I looked for it several times later that night and never saw it again."],"Latitude":"34.275568","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"03/19/2013 08:20 UTC","Longitude":"-118.358483","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around March 19th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46337.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.275568,+-118.358483(46337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46337) map </A>","Summary":"3 steady bright lights 2 green 1 red moving rapidly and sporadically above Lake View Terrace mountains above Kurt Street, figure 8 movement.
