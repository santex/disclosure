I laid down on my back once I was on top of the tower to look at the stars.It was a clear night.As I was star gazing, I noticed a tiny light approximately the same size and brightness as most of the stars in the sky.It was moving across the sky at a steady rate.It was too far off and too small to be something in our atmosphere and I concluded it must be a satellite in orbit.I remember thinking how neat it was to happen to see a satellite by chance with the naked eye.I continued to watch the light as it moved across the sky for a minute or two, when it suddenly shot off at an accelerated rate at a 90* angle to its previous trajectory.It did not increase in brightness as if it were falling or coming closer, but seemed to disappear out into space within a matter of seconds.My reaction at the time was literally, \"Holy s**t!What was that?\"Over the years, I have never been able to come up with a satisfactory theory why a man made object would suddenly change direction and speed like that.If it was a meteor or space debris in orbit reflecting moonlight and collided with another object to send it speeding off like that, why was the other object not visible?I did not see it make contact with anything before it shot off into space.My only conclusion is that it was intelligently controlled.I have never forgotten it or told anyone other than members of my family.���"],"Longitude":"-81.236211","Tags":"City","Summary":"Small star-size light in motion suddenly changing direction and accelerating.","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Lexington","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"33.981537","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16447.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16447.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/15/1993 07:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.981537,+-81.236211(16447)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16447) map </A>","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around November 15th 1993"],"Region":"South Carolina","Date Submitted":"11/15/1993 07:30 UTC"}
