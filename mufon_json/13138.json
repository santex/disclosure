From my perspective, it was about the size of an elongated quarter. Looked around to see if it was perhaps a plane as location of object appeared to be just east of O'Hare airport. Determined it was NOT a plane, as I witnessed in comparison 3 moving planes of varying size, distance and direction at same time. This was NOT an airplane. It stayed stationary for perhaps 8 seconds, then vanished. I drive in this direction everyday at this time, and have done so for past 2 years, andh have never seen anything like it before. Very peculiar."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown"}
