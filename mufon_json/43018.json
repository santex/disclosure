He then came back in the house and called me over to come and look at the glowing orb. I stepped outside and he pointed out where it was. It was across the street in a vacant lot next to a fairly newly planted tree, which wasnt much taller than 15 feet. It appeared the orb was approximately halfway between the ground and what would have been the top of the tree, it just hovered in the same spot for a while, glowing an orange color."],"Date of the Event":"08/10/2012 07:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lisbon","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-72.022496","City":"Lisbon","Date Submitted":"10/04/2012 02:55 UTC","Latitude":"41.64369","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43018.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.64369,+-72.022496(43018)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43018) map </A>"}
