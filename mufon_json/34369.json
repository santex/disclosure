{"divs":["Sighting Details���Last week, a UFO enthusiast asked me if I had ever seen a UFO. I answered that I \"might\" have seen one between 1973 and 1976, but wasn't sure. It was not something that my traveling partner and I recognized. We were both Ph.D. DuPont chemists coming home from a business trip, As we drove home south on Route 1 from the Philadelphia airport after a rainstorm about 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. we saw a red orb in the clouds slowly moving from east to west. We actually could not see the object, only its glow in the clouds. Lots of airplanes were in the sky and, since we lived in the area, we were used to seeing these, but the red orb was definitely different. We followed it for about 15-20 minutes continually discussing what it might be. At that point, we arrived home and the orb continued traveling from Delaware into Maryland. Obviously, it was moving very slowly and never picked up speed. In response to my e-mail about this incident, my friend sent me the current report of red orbs observed in Pennsylvania on November 5, 2011. It sounds like the same thing we saw!��� This report submitted at the request of Roger Marsh."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34369.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34369.html"],"Case Number":"34369","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/01/1975 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.210252,+-77.189035(34369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34369) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/29/2011 01:01 UTC","Latitude":"41.210252","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Red glow in rain clouds from an orb","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been no other sightings in South of Philadelphia Air","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"South of Philadelphia Air","Log Number":"US-12292011-0005","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.189035","Source":"MUFON"}
