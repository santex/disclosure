The object appeared to be cycling between red and blue colors at a very high rate of speed. I watched the object with a pair of binoculars and it literally looked like some kind of energy field over the hull of some kind of large craft and then it slowly dissolved as it headed inland. The sky was very clear that night."],"Longitude":"-124.008341","Case Number":"25849","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","Region":"Oregon","City":"Lincoln City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25849.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25849.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
