I turned to go to Lincoln and noticed a bright light blinking off to my left I thought it may have been a plane or a helicopter but as I got closer I noticed it wasn't very far off the ground and as I got parallel to it I could see details of it a bright white light in three corners and a red light in the middle the lights light up the bottom so I could see it was a grey or matt black underneath. It just stayed in one spot hovering in a field between a house and the road I was traveling on. As I passed I was able to get my phone out to record it I rolled down my window and it had no sound I stuck my phone out as I was driving to record it. I was not scared I was excited! Then I went around the next corner and lost sight of it in my rearview mirror."],"Summary":"driving to work observed a bright light flashing thought was a plane but as too low and hoverd and no sound tried to viedo.","Country":"United States"}
