Went outside and got in the hot tub.While looking at the sky, I noticed what appeared to be flashing ball of red,blue, and white lights. I went inside and found my binoculars and by steadyingthem on the edge of the hot tub, was able to focus on the object. It was diskshaped, tilted at approximately a 40 degree angle. Could clearly make out thelights around the edge, but the center was dark. I thought that it may of beenthe planet Mars, but it was visible, and further to the West of this object. Icalled to my wife to come look, and she used the binoculars and her descriptionis the same as mine. We had our 13 year old son come look at it, he is thinkingit is a star with gas clouds around it. Our 9 year old daughter was also awakeand she came and looked at it also. At the time Im typing this it is still inthe sky, but is no longer tilted at a steep angle, and is relatively flat to thehorizon."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Log Number":"","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ochelata","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Latitude":"36.600091"}
