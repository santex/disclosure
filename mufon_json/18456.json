When it apeared again it had turned from ball of light to triangle with lots of flashing lights. I told my friend go grab a camera. He told me to keep an eye on it. He began to film about a minute when it just took off out of sight. We were both surprised and excited about it. We rewined the film and saw it again. We still were surprised at what we saw. My friend had just got out the army, he said he never saw no militery craft like that. So we believe it couldn't be militery. (We have video of this but couldn't post it)"],"Latitude":"41.883244","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around July 31st 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-87.623498","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date Submitted":"07/31/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Chicago","Log Number":"US-08032009-0005","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18456.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18456.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/31/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"Illinois"}
