As we were passing the Phillips 66 gas station by the Lake Tapawingo fire station I looked up in the sky as I normally do, sky watching. I along with my girlfriend who was driving, and my best friend in the back seat witnessed what appeared to be a SOLID METAL SPHERE of some kind... I have only seen something like this once before and I saw it above Blue Springs South High School about the same time frame around a month ago. The only way I can really describe this object is the Vatican's golden sphere statue that sits in the middle of the courtyard. I witnessed this object along with my girlfriend and best friend for approx. 32-35 seconds in broad daylight at 4:22 PM to 4:23 PM on December 10, 2012. It disappeared before I could pull out my camera phone."],"Latitude":"39.096326","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around December 10th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-12102012-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/10/2012 11:08 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:32","Tags":"City","Case Number":"44444","Date of the Event":"12/10/2012 04:22 UTC"}
