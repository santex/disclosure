They're eyes were huge and almond shaped, they had big heads and four fingers on each hand.I was so scared.I had a sudden feeling to say \"Don't go.\" Two years later I was sleeping when I heard a noise like a bird picking at my window.I looked up and saw another human-like entity.I was so scared I couldn't move. Several days later my friend and I were playing later than usual and when is was dark there was giant ring of light hovering over my house. My friends dad was fixing a truck. he had a flashlight facing upward so we though it was the flashlight. We turned it off and the ring was still on."],"Latitude":"34.017042","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Pico Rivera"}
