I'm in my back yard working and i notice the object described as mentioned. It makes me laugh when highly educated scientists say they don't believe in UFO,s because they have never seen one. I have lived in the heart of tornado alley for 51 years and have never seen a tornado, does that mean they don't exist. Their is NO doubt in my mind that UFO's exist, how could they not exist considering the vastness of the universe. I have witnesses other events also, just wish i would have had a camera. The thing i don,t understand is the way i felt while watching the object that i described. I should have been excited, scared or emotional, but i just stood there and watched while it slowly went on its way, and went back to yard work, i thought about it working but that was all."],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-09172008-0011","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12516.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12516.html"],"Longitude":"-97.512448","Source":"MUFON"}
