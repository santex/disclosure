{"Date Submitted":"03/27/2011 02:14 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was visiting a friend's house in Grand Rapids, MI when I looked out the window and saw the typical disk shaped UFO hovering right over the tree tops about a half to a quarter mile from me out the window. It was silent and there were about 9 yellow lights on it. One of the lights was on the top. It was 4:35 PM. The sky was overcast. I watched it for about a minute and a half trying to figure out what it was and then I turned to my friend and said, \"What is that?\" When I turned back to the window, it was gone. I wrote everything down at the time so I wouldn't forget."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Longitude":"-85.662736","Date of the Event":"03/21/2011 04:35 UTC","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around March 21st 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.97286,+-85.662736(28419)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28419) map </A>","Latitude":"42.97286","City":"Grand Rapids","Log Number":"US-03272011-0005","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"28419","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28419.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28419.html"],"Summary":"saw disk shaped UFO over tree tops","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
