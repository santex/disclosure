Almost daily this object can be seen from my front yard, it also comes at the same time every time. I decided to look at the object through a telescope. After viewing it from my telescope it was apparent to me and my family that it was no ordinary object. I feel this is a site that I have never experienced before. Every time I lose site of it, it descends below the tree line."],"Region":"New York","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/28/2011 05:15 UTC"}
