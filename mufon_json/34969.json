He noticed a star moving, ask if it is a falling star, so I looked up, it was not a falling star, clearly not that. It was located to the left in the night sky or west, moving east-wards and extremely fast, its speed covered the entire sky in about 1 minute or less. It looked to be the same size as a bright star, but its speed was unusual compared to any airraft I have personally ever seen. We live in the landing path of John Wayne Airport so I see alot of planes, granted it could have been a jet, however it was so high it looked equal to the stars as to the distance away. My instinct felt that it was not a jet as it seemed to me faster that any jet Ive ever seen. It disappeared."],"Case Number":"34969","Log Number":"US-01192012-0020","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Orange","There were no other sightings in Orange on or around January 18th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California"}
