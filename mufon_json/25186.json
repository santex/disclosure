Spotted approx. 15 degrees above west horizon, a bright star like object that was larger than any stars or planets. At it's brightest, it was amber, then dimming to red, disappeared then reappeared red brightening to amber, and did this several times. It was nearly as bright as the ISS. Watched this for 26 minutes, between appearances I grabbed binoculars, camera, tripod, and called Mike, the local MUFON investigator, to see if he could spot it. The ISS passed over at 9:30, but the object didn't reappear to me after the phone call. Two pictures didn't show the object. I checked the star charts and the prominent planets would have been closer to or below the horizon at 9pm. Will watch tonight and see if it's there again, as a planet would be."],"Region":"West Virginia","Date Submitted":"08/26/2010 11:52 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Bright, large, star like, amber dimming to red, disappearing-reappearing on west horizon.","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"08/25/2010 09:02 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.270082,+-81.551904(25186)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25186) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Parkersburg","There were no other sightings in Parkersburg on or around August 25th 2010"],"Object Features":"Other","Longitude":"-81.551904","City":"Parkersburg","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
