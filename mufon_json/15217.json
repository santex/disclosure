My vison is a little bad so some things could have been decieving but i thought i saw it change from that ball to a circle with the yellow orange lights around it. when it got farther away like 5 minutes later i checked it out again with the binoculars and saw it change back and forth about every 10 seconds from the yellow-orange to a tealblue-aqua-greenish color it was moving slow and and i started to loose it under a tree line the object was bright without using the binoculars but using them it wasn't it was too small and or wouldn't show up on a camera i have 2 others with me that saw it though one doesn't think it was one and the other did'nt know what it was. If it was an aircraft I am sorry but i've never seen one go so slow."],"Date of the Event":"01/30/2009 08:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.617487,+-86.71445(15217)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15217) map </A>","Latitude":"41.617487","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Slow moving yellow orange object.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in La Porte","There were no other sightings in La Porte on or around January 30th 2009"],"Longitude":"-86.71445","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Circle, Flash, Unknown"}
