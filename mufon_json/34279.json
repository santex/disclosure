It held my attention until a second one caught my peripheral vision I watch the two of the recede toward the KC area to the east when a third came from the west moving east behind the other two. I watched the three of them receding when a fourth and finally a fifth traveling in the same directions. All five were a very pretty dark glowing orange with no change in color or no apparent strobe or pulsating. I couldn���t tell the distance from where I was stand but I would guess between 2 and 3 miles. They followed one another by a separation of maybe 20 to 30 seconds. They were moving faster than a plane would have been and even though it was a cloudless starlit evening I did not see from where they came. I watched them for about 5 minutes as they disappeared toward the east. What was strange is that on such a night you can see a plane at quite a distance and hear its drone. These objects seem to appear as I was watching the others out of the south west somewhere. They were bright enough and attractive enough that they would have been noticed following one another had they been in some sort of formation but they were not. Each on caught my attention separately and totally by surprise as I was watching the others. Too cool!"],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lenexa","There were no other sightings in Lenexa on or around December 24th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"12/24/2011 08:40 UTC","Case Number":"34279","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
