The first light then morphed into what looked like the top of a trident. outer edges were bluish and the center redish.. flew across the sky for approx. 2 min. I went inside to grab my camera phone, but object was gone."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:01","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.79864","Object Shape":"Chevron, Sphere","Log Number":"US-01102013-0017","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.522661,+-86.79864(45138)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45138) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Case Number":"45138","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45138.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45138.html"],"Region":"Alabama","City":"Birmingham","Latitude":"33.522661","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Birmingham","There were no other sightings in Birmingham on or around January 10th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"01/10/2013 11:02 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Louvres, Other","Summary":"TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS FLYING IN AN -S- SHAPED PATTERN BEHIND EACH OTHER."}
