{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy mom was sleeping on our back screened-in porch on a summer night. She wasawakened from sleep, but not because of any sound or light. She immediatelyobserved a three pointed craft, hovering at treetop level in the southeaternsky. She observed absolutely no sound. She knew immediately that it was not aconventional aircraft, as the craft was hovering, emitted no engine sound, andhad no blinking lights. There was one steady white light at each corner of thecraft, and a black triangle-shaped expanse in between. The craft was verylarge, and blocked out starlight. The craft then moved slowly to the west, anddropped out of sight behind the trees in the southeastern sky. She reportedthis to the three of us the next morning. We all remember this event to thisday."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1676.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1676.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.52344,+-84.306082(1676)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1676) map </A>","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Archbold","There were no other sightings in Archbold on or around November 30th 1989"],"Latitude":"41.52344","Longitude":"-84.306082","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"1676","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"11/30/1989 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Black Triangle Seen in Fulton Co.","Date of the Event":"11/30/1989 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Archbold","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
