I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she saw it before it disappeared to the north. The whole incident lasted maybe four seconds. It made no sound and the whole craft seemed semicloaked. The ligts on the leading edge of the craft looked like florescent tubes and were very dim. If there was a full moon I doubt I would have been able to see it. It looked like it was moving as fast as a shooting star would."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
