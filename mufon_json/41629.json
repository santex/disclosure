The light seemed to come to a point in all directions of the rhombus and it stayed still until it began to suddenly drop with a south left trajectory. Being completely shocked at the brightness of the light and it being the only visible light in the sky I kept my eyes on the light to observe it's actions. I could see through the trees that the light did come to a hault after it's descending. I lost sight of the light by traveling towards the light and then it began to descend."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41629.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41629.html"],"City":"Portland","Date Submitted":"08/11/2012 12:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.533521,+-122.542363(41629)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41629) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
