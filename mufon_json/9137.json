At 22:00 it is at a bearing of 172* magnetic and about 20* from the horizon. It shines brightly white with flashing blue and red lights. I can not detect any movement. It just hangs there. I do not know of any satellite that flashes blue and red lights. With binoculars you can see the blue and red flashing light very clearly.
