I looked up , nothing 10 steps forward & there it was high to the left blinking pure white light than blink off & so on , obviously in a gliding motion from S to N line , needless to say I thought \"thanks guys & the humor too\" , I thought it was cute . I was in a steady slowed pace & didn't stop this time . Than the darkened tree branch & its foillege got in to my view obscuring the flushing lights . As I quickened past the tree I saw it last time blink than dark & than I couldn't see it anymore as I turned again & the large condo blocked it . When I got to the lightened area (security lights) I checked my watch & it was 11:05 plus some seconds . I did made sure if I'd still see it in the distance somewhere later but no . At home I was by the window 10-15 min later & saw a plane going same direction more or less but that one was human made ."],"trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around July 11th 2010"],"Case Number":"24448","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-79.380134","Object Shape":"Flash","Date of the Event":"07/11/2010 11:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-07122010-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24448.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24448.html"],"City":"Toronto","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.659136","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Humorous sighting tonight.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/12/2010 12:07 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
