{"Summary":"Santa Cesaria webcam--see diff. report from 8/03/2010.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24946.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24946.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsi read the report of someone seeing ufos on a webcam in santa cesaria or cesarea in italy, so i found it and checked it out. i will attach more pics in a second submission. it's infrared photography at night. looks like black and white. the area is very well lit, and you can see the shore, a big hotel\\spa, a parking lot, and some landscape across a little bay. lights blink on and off, you see a bit of traffic lights, and closer in, garbage trucks, etc. at first, what i saw was identical to the photo attached to that earlier report i had just read. (1st pic) i checked the times\\date and reloaded and re-reloaded a few times, and finally concluded i was actually looking at the current pictures and the same object was visible. i was surprised at that. the webcam pics showed several areas in the water that looked fuzzy, kinda weird, including the one very interesting object, kind of a gyropscope-looking thing. these seemed stationary, so i thought, well maybe it's lens flare. you see a lot of \"ufos\" that look like just lens flare. (will someone please tell people about lens flare?) and then i saw this little glowing sphere floating over the water. it was gone in a few seconds. my husband and daughter came over to watch it. and then i saw a jelly-bean shaped glowing object travel along the shore, seeming to hover over the water, from right to left. hmmm. it seemed kind of fast, though i cannot tell the actual scale of the scene too well. then a couple of minutes later, the gyroscope thing was just gone. poof. is it a beacon of some kind, i wonder. now, my curiosity was piqued, so i watched for about a half hour more. when it was a bit lighter out, i saw another glowing ship of some kind, i guess jelly bean again. (2d, 3d pic) i biggified the picture and it looks like a hot dog or a glowing catamaranish kind of thing. i saw what looked like disturbances below the water. are there whales there so close to land? i saw the misty-looking area again for a bit. (separate pics) i saw a motor boat later on, when it was nearly light. it was a lot smaller and some slower than the glowing thing. i think the area bears watching, at least."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/05/2010 04:30 UTC","Longitude":"17.240009","Case Number":"24946","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"Italy","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Taranto","Log Number":"IT-08052010-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.469238,+17.240009(24946)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24946) map </A>","Region":"Puglia","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.469238","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Taranto","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/05/2010 12:54 UTC"}
