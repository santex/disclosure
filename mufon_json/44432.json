I didn't think much of it at first due to the proximity of a local airport, but then realized it was moving against the normal flightpath of airliners which is normally approaching from the northeast. As I reached my truck ( about 10 seconds later), I noticed that it had begun to ascend steadily at a steep angle, probably close to 90 degrees. The object almost looked like the exhaust from a rocket in the way it glowed,but there was no sound or smoke plume. I've seen the shuttle and Delta rockets during night launch, and the glow was similar, but didn't light up the sky the way rockets do. The object continued upward in a straight line, moving through the cloud cover, until I lost sight of it."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Glowing red/orange object sighted in night sky north of Orlando on 12/9","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Lake Mary","There were no other sightings in Lake Mary on or around December 9th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
