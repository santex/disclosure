{"Latitude":"43.78572","Summary":"6 orange lights moving along the same flight path about a minute or two apart from each other","Case Number":"49405","Log Number":"US-08032013-0002","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and I were in the backyard with a fire and witnessed an orange light moving steadily from approximately north to south. The light was relatively solid but pulsated a little bit. There was no sound. The light moved very quickly and was quite large so it appeared to be traveling at a pretty low altitude. We were unable to make out any structure of the object except for the orange circular light. There were no other lights on the object itself that were visible. We thought it was a hospital helicopter or something. Then one or two minutes later, a second object of the same description flew overhead along the same approximate flight path. A total of six of these objects flew overhead over a time period of less than a half hour. The only thing I could think of is that these are some kind of military helicopters, but why no sound? I was under the impression that helicopters had multiple white and red lights typically as well. My dad took some pictures and video with his phone, I will try and obtain them from him to add to this report."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/03/2013 02:03 UTC","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.78572,+-88.781588(49405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49405) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49405.html"],"Region":"Wisconsin","Longitude":"-88.781588","Date of the Event":"08/02/2013 11:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
