It looked like nothing I've seen before. It was an isocilies triangle and was spinning as if rolling, 1 light on each point, and it was reddish black. There were lights all over the middle and was going at least 1,000 mph, and as quickly as it came, it vanished beyond the horizon, not making a SINGEL sound. Throught the experience and after I was shocked and very confuesed. Most of it is black, and I got home at 11 o' clock."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"06:30:00","Summary":"I was walking home when I saw a light","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/14/1926 04:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.904372,+-77.026406(10043)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10043) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"02/14/1926 04:30 UTC","Case Number":"10043","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None"}
