I thought I was looking at stars they were still fixed objects then they started moving across the sky white in color weird smooth movement I watched them as they left out of my view this is 4 seperate lights not a formation 4 separate events within 30 minutes One grew brighter and then moved across the sky till it was gone. all objects started out as stationary with no movement . as I said I thought I was looking at bright stars. It made my hair stand up on my body. Just absolutey fascinating. I have made a report of my sighting in January 2007. I thought I should also report this. People have got to learn to get out and see this stuff for themselves. It's unbelievable what is going on in our skies."],"Region":"Arkansas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7770.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7770.html"],"Case Number":"7770","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.20207,+-91.822343(7770)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7770) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/28/2007 04:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None"}
