I got out my phone but I couldn't get it to turn on it was like it was dead but my battery was fully charged. The object just hovered over my neighbor's house for around 20 minutes and started to sound like a huming sound. I saw a few light's around the craft and then it just left like 1,000 MPH. After that I went to bed around 11 P.M. and awoke around 3 A.M. as I went to the restroom and came back, for about 20 minutes I tried falling asleep but then it was like my whole bedroom was blinding, under my bedroom door was like complete white blinding light. I started hearing noises unlike anything I've ever seen. Just huming sound and that's all. It lasted for around 5 minutes and it was gone. Next morning my phone worked and then that following night, the object was back but it was across my house for around 10 minutes and then it just, flew away."]}
