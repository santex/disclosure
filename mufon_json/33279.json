{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside my apartment on my cell phone and I told the person on the other end that there was something in the sky. I immediately went inside and grabbed my camera and began taking pictures. I know I went out with a friend that night and took the camera. THe next day when I checked the pics, the camera appeared to be burned of fried on the bottom. BUT the memory card was fine. There were only pictures of the ufo in question, not any pictures from the night out. I dont remember taking as many pics as I did and I do not remember ever zooming in on the objects but yet that appears to be what I have pics of."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33279.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33279_submitter_file1__100_1299.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33279_submitter_file2__100_1303.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33279_submitter_file3__100_1300.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33279.html"],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Unknown","City":"Austin","Date Submitted":"11/11/2011 10:42 UTC","Longitude":"-97.785232","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.450368,+-97.785232(33279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33279) map </A>","Case Number":"33279","Date of the Event":"09/28/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11112011-0014","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"30.450368","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There was one other sighting in Austin on or around September 28th 2008","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Summary":"Saw a shiny pulsating light with many colors, noticed a craft of some sort.
