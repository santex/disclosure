I tried to get a pic but they were gone when I pulled my phone out, I waited still looking in the spot they were when 6 bright lights appeared, I was able to get a pic of them hovering, one as they started moving. I first thought it was one solid abject, they started moving very fast and in different directions. I was kinda scared I was outside by myself, I tried to call someone else out to look at the lights, my 2 way radio stopped working, the battery was completely drained. As quick as I could snap 2 pics they were gone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.160358,+-75.519638(38690)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38690) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/31/2012 02:08 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.160358","Case Number":"38690","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.519638","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
