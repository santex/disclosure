Clear cloudless day. A silver object caught my eye, it was slightly different looking, so I kept watching it as i drove. I could see it in my vision at all times while driving. It did not appear to be moving from my vantage point. I did not see any planes on the area at the time. It was far away and high but close enough to see it glowing very brightly (I thought maybe it was the sun reflecting) but it was not moving. I asked my children what they thought it was. They also could not figure it out. It was not acting like a typical plane. We all watched it for about 20 seconds and it just disappeared. Not took off or moved but vanished. My only thought would be a balloon, if it had been a huge one? but it was not round it was oval shaped. Hoping others saw this too?"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07022011-0010","Country":"United States","Case Number":"29849","Region":"Oregon"}
