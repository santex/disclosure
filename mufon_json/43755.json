Noticed what I thought was an air plane fly across the hwy, it got above the field to the side of the hwy I was on. I pulled over and watched it decend down while fly back over to the hwy right over my car. The first time I saw it the only reason I noticed it was because it was hovering over the bridge like just above it making it maybe 100 ft above my car. Literally freaked me out a bit and then I kept seeing it more and more. I've seen it at least 15 times since August. A few of my coworkers have seen it too. Not really sure what it was but its definitely an un-identified craft. It looks like the same craft seen in KC in July of this year."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"11/07/2012 12:43 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Case Number":"43755","City":"Hazelwood","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43755.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43755.html"],"Latitude":"38.77981","Log Number":"US-11072012-0008","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hazelwood","There were no other sightings in Hazelwood on or around November 6th 2012"],"Summary":"I have seen this several times over the past few months all around the same time"}
