cool night air, was not much else to do. first i will tell you that i am very familure with the night sky and can tell the difference between planets, stars satalights and different aircraft. i have been through private pilot and cival air patrol ground schools and have had over 60 or so flight hours in private pilot training, and familure with what lights aircraft should and are required to be equiped with and what each lights function and meaning is etc. on the night of my sighting the sky was clear and i was sitting back looking up at the stars while enjoying my radio station. i was facing up and out to the east. i noticed some movement in the corner of my left eye, i faced that way and saw what looked like and moved like 4 bright white satalights moving in perfect formation across the sky at a speed a little faster than satalights move across the sky. the formation was that of a perfect triangle with the fourth light dead center. all the lights (3 points and 1 center) were identicle in size, color ( white with slightest hent of blue) and brightness. as i have no way of knowing the size i cant make an estamate on the altitude or speed. but i got the sence it was pretty high and cruzin at a good speed, if i put my hand up to the sky the object would be equivalent in length as the width of 1 1\\2 fingers. the object had only these lights and they stayed solid. no red\\green wing tip possition lights, anticollision or any other for that matter. the object moved in a straight line to the south east crossing my view of the sky at an angle. i was very confused as to what it could be, i took out my headphones ( volume was not high so i had no ringing in ears from radio station) and listened for sounds of engines which i should have been able to hear if it was a passenger jet, prop plane or rotocraft even if distant i can always hear aircraft in the sky in this area even if distant, but heard nothing, this is also a quiet neighborhood. i still figured that just maybe it could be a newly deployed satalight. i have seen on the nasa channel where a satalight would be deployed by being released in a case where the case comes apart and the parts drift appart leaving the satalight. but i was convinced it was not some kind of conventional aircraft or space junk moving in formation when after about 15 or 20 seconds the craft rotated approx 90 degrees to the right on its axis ( the center light ) over the period of about 3 seconds. at that point it stoped rotating and was still flying in the exact same line of travel and speed but now sideways. facing almost south west but traveling on to the south east. it continued on for about 10 seconds in this configuration then just like it did before it now rotated on its axis left back to its origional configuration now facing its line of travel. i was realy excited to see this because i knew for sure it was not any satalight or aircraft i have ever seen. i was thinking this is ither some out of this world craft (cool) or something brand new that we had (also cool), and if it is something we have it has to be using some new kind of propulsion to be able to rotate and fly sideways so smoothly like that, and if it is ours that is also very exciting to me as someone that loves aircraft and flying. it continued on to the south east untill it was out of site. both of the crafts rotations were the same speed (about 3 seconds) and smooth, never seeming to have an effect on its straight line of travel or speed. the best i can compair it to would be a tank moving down the highway and the turret being able to swivel left and right without effecting the speed or course of the vehicle. only what i saw was what appeared to be an entire aircraft do the same. in my aircraft i can do what is called a crab which is where you give full left or right rudder and opposite aileron to put the aircraft in a slightly sideways configuration, but only about 10-20 degrees or so and at the expense of speed, it creates major drag and is used sometimes to drasticly slow the aircraft, usualy for a landing where you may be coming in a little high, it allows you to loose some altitude and speed do to drag quickly. i know of no aircraft that put itself in a sideways configuration at high speed without breaking apart. some aircraft can hover and fly sideways at very very slow speeds and some rotocraft but not at high speeds in the hundreds of miles per hour or faster. because of the size of craft do to altitude and limited number of stars out at night in our sky arround here i did not get a chance to see it cross over a stationary star to see if it would block it out, i did watch for that but it did not cross any stars in its line of flight from my point of view. this might have helped rule out separate objects doing formation ( very impressive formation ) flying but i realy got the sence it was a single solid object. also the lights on the craft all maintained thier brightness during the entire sighting across the sky. satalights i see will usualy blink or fade, these lights did not. i dont know for sure what i saw that night but it was deffidently making deliberate movements making me believe it was controlled by something or someone. also for refference the crafts line of travel was south east with the line taking it over or just slightly north of bfl meadows field, rather than right over the city of bakersfield. if anything it would have skirted the area of bakersfield on its northern edge. i have included a picture i made on a paint program showing the crafts appearence, line of travel and movements. what i actualy seen looked a bit more distant than it appears in the pic. consider it a somewhat zoomed in look at exactly what i seen. also the possitions in the sky where the craft changed its configuration was much more distant from each other than what you see in the pic, it was about 10 seconds between the left and right rotations and the craft was seen for a total of about 50 seconds to 1 minute which covered the entire line of sight of sky i could see which was quite a bit."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date
