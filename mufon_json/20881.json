Uploaded pictures to computer some time later, and when running the slide through spotted this one, white,appears still. The second one is dark, and appears to be moving. I took no pictures of any visible object flying. These just showed up on the pictures. It was late afternoon around 3pm, the view was northwest from my deck for the white disk, and straight west for the dark object in Aurora. November 6, 2009 about 3 pm I also had a visual sighting sometime back I'd say in March 2009, I was coming home on the RTD Train, riding backwards, and my view was to the North, toward Boulder, and just sitting there above the plains this side of the mountains was a dark disc shaped object. There were no clouds at that time, it was around 4:30 pm. Of course the train was moving and then my view was blocked."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.551451,+-105.775547(20881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20881) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20881_submitter_file1__November29th2009185.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20881_submitter_file2__November29th2009196.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20881.html"],"Summary":"White Disc sitting up there, did not see it when I took picture, notice on upload.","Case Number":"20881","trends":[""]}
