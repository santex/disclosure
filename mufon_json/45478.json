Object was so obvious in the cloud deck so pronounced brilliant light very over whelming site I thought wow what is that? Stared at it and was puzzled it didn't move and it's shape was so strange like unnormal to be just sitting still in the clouds and shaped like a monolith or domino frame Object stationary very very fluid brilliant bright white light inside the domino shape and at the bottom of the object base corner it looked as thought the light was seeping out the corner off of object and left like vapor trail sparks My reaction was of great interest and tried to pull off road to observe the object while not driving. After sighting just went about my errand I lost sight of object by it simple disappearing , I did wait to see if it would come back into view for about 5 minutes but it did not reappear."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Bay Village","There were no other sightings in Bay Village on or around January 10th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Bay Village","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Region":"Ohio"}
