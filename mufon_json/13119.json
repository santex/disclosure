We had traveled north of Penalosa, Ks and had turned back to the West on 21st Street. It is a paved country road. 4 deer had just crossed the road in front of us so we were on the lookout for more deer. My friends headlights point down some so it was really dark out. There were no other cars on the road, just us. Suddenly a brilliant green light flashed into our windshield. It only lasted a couple of seconds and then it was gone. We both looked at each other and said \"did u see that?!! What was that green flash?!!! We both saw it! We don't know what it was, but it was very strange. We didn't seem to have any loss of time or mechanical malfunctions. We just kept traveling to our destination. We didn't see any craft in the air, but it was so dark out on that country road. It seemed to be pretty close to the ground. Do you have any ideas as to what this could have been? I've seen spotlights on police helicopters and that was not what this was! Thank you for your time on this matter. K Jones & D Robinson"],"Disposition":"IFO"}
