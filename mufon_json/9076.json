There was a line of clouds which obscured the sunset and this wasn���t a spectacular sunset as I had expected. The clouds were very thick and high. Air traffic from Charlotte International Airport (CLT) was passing directly over head and you could see the aircraft above and through the cloud deck. I was trying a variety of shutter speeds to try to get some decent images. When I got home and down loaded the photos to my computer (from a Nikon D80). I glanced through them quickly and was about to delete the entire set of images because I was not really happy with them. Then in image 0056, I noticed a dark shape below an opening in the cloud deck. The opening was white and contrasted the entire image. When I loaded the photo in Photoshop and did some standard adjustments for level, color and contrast, a dark triangular shape appeared clearly. Enlarging the image and enhancing it come more showed a definite black triangle. I looked at the image before (0055) and after (0057) and the shape does not appear in either photo. The time between image 0055 and 0056 where the shape appeared was 24 seconds. The time between image 0056 (image of triangle) and 0057(object does not appear) was 17 seconds. All the shooting data for each image is shown in the image I put together. I did not notice anything unusual or out of the ordinary while taking the photos. There was no air traffic from CTL at the time the images were taken. When I enlarged and enhanced the triangle in image 0056 and applied sharpening in Photoshop, you start to see some edge structure of the triangle. This is not visible in the image which I put together. But there appears to be a sharp edge line on the leading edge of the triangle. It almost looks like when it passed under the cloud opening, the bottom is in shadow (black) and the front edges show a faint straight edge. Also you will note a light spot appearing in center of the shape. If you compare the before and after images (055 and 057), there is no trace of the object, nor is there any unusual change in the cloud pattern. The texture does not match the bottom of the cloud deck in any manner as far as color or hue. If anyone has any idea of what it was I photographed I would like to hear from them. I have been doing photography for a long time and am familiar with aircraft. This does not fit into what I have observed over the years. It might be a cloud effect, but I don���t think so. Any thoughts to what it might be? I decided to keep all the images for the fun of it now. Location: Fort Mill, SC Note: This is a screen shot of the original PDF image.
