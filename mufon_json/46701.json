Police they gave me phone number to Mufon, I called and made report to Mufon","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I were looking out the second story bedroom window when we noticed slow moving bright light moving from left to right very slowly. When a plane appeared the object would go dark and disappear, then reappear after plane vanished. I grabbed my digital camera and stated taking pictures. When I took some pictures the object was there, but when I looked at the camera it was not there. This happened several times. I called Union City Police to report it. They gave me the phone number to Mufon. I called and made my report. The Mufon Representative seem to try to debunk what I saw. He said that I was seeing Venus or a plane. I told him that I was a former Navy veteran aircraft mechanic and I know the difference between a plane and venus. I got furstrated and said ok, without telling him that I had pictures."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46701.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46701.html"],"Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/09/2013 10:33 UTC","Latitude":"37.593392","Log Number":"US-04092013-0020","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Union City","There were no other sightings in Union City on or around March 2nd 2012"],"City":"Union City","Case Number":"46701"}
