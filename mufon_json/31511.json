5. the lights continued to track due south and toward the southwest of our position until we lost sight of them behind trees. likely viewed for a 3 mile track. general track of their travel seemed to be from north to south. 6. managed at the last minute to capture a cell phone photo (5 mp) of the third object before going out of our view (attached) a bit blurry but you can see the general shape and color. photo does not due visual experience justice. observations - the objects traveled a steady pace\\speed as would a light aircraft if following their same pattern. the altitude level\\constant the whole viewing. possible altitude of 2 ��� 5,000 feet. estimate degree of inclination of 15 degrees. believe that distance from our position at closest to the west was between 1-2 miles. equidistant from each other and level, never varying as in locked in with the other. these objects made no sound, had significant size and brilliance, were certainly not normal aircraft, rotor craft, satellites, iss, fireworks, rockets, flares, meteors, planets, stars, weather phenomenon, blimps, balloons ��� hot air or otherwise, suspended objects, reflections, remote control devices, projections, or lanterns, and were not being towed by another aircraft, etc. no exhaust or smoke could be seen emitted. i must say if this was a hoax it is one very very elaborate well-funded\\planned coordinated high tech hoaxer(s) covering an amazing geographical area (basically around the world based on my limited research so far). no visible structure between above, below, in front, in back"],"Date of the Event":"08/27/2011 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/04/2011 10:01 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-09042011-0013","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31511.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31511_submitter_file1__AppleValleyOrb0827110905PMPhoto(2).jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31511.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Howard","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-82.353141","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Case Number":"31511","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.435576","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Howard","Summary":"3 red/orange glowing lights of ball shape objects pass through Knox County Ohio in a series (Viewed West of Apple Valley Lake moving from North to South) - Trying to figure out how this was hoaxed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.435576,+-82.353141(31511)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31511) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
