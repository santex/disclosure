( i did take tons of pictures and video......they are all too dark... i did however do negative imaging and lightened imaging on the digi photos and saw many orbs in the pictures but did not see any of the phenomenon that occurred...i was very disappointed. today i am developing film from my regular camera that i grabbed. also there were 2 witnesses...my mother and father.. i woke them up. how could i not....we stayed up and watched the entire thing. could you please tell me if anyone has reported this sighting as well from the sacrament\\elverta area of california the am hours of july 31st 2005. i reported it here because i respect your orginazation. by the way my father did call channel 3 news here when it was happening. they said they had no other reports and he said he felt really silly like they thought he was joking or crazy. i would appreciate a response from you so much. thank you."],"Longitude":"-119.414012","Log Number":"US-08012005-0002","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like"}
