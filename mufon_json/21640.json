{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went out on my front porch at about 10pm CST. I saw a point of light at roughly 20K feet moving in a north-by-northeasterly direction. It was moving extremely fast in a manner I can only describe as smooth. The speed was incredible, I've never seen anything at that height moving remotely close to that speed. I watched as the light moved in my direction and, apparently, slightly upwards. There were clear skies with not a cloud in the sky. After 3-5 seconds, the brilliant white light got much brighter, approximately 2-3 times as bright, then disappeared. There was absolutely no noise. This was near Braker Lane, just east of I-35."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-97.733221","Date of the Event":"01/24/2010 10:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were no other sightings in Austin on or around January 24th 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/25/2010 12:35 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"21640","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21640.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21640.html"],"City":"Austin","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.276943,+-97.733221(21640)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21640) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Single point of brilliant white light moving extremely fast.
