I knew it was differant when I had been used to seeing red lights with turquase [OUR STUFF].So I got up and began following, I saw a tray in the sky, it was scudding under the clouds, it had a t-like design on the underside,it's a dark color and the craft or ship was light in color. Afterwards I was relunctant to report it fearing I would be designated insane and or spirited away to some hidden location. A month passed and I got the nerve to talk to someone I worked with, she suggested I tell MUFON. Another month went by and I worked up enough nerve to report and I did. Within months I got a call from one of your investigators on my voicemail and lost the call. Now it's been three years now, I report again and I hope I don't lose the call again."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29044.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29044.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.149978,+-118.251645(29044)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29044) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"29044","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"05/10/2011 04:59 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Traylike,flying west to east, slight banking, turns southeast and flies east","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Other","Latitude":"34.149978","Log Number":"US-05102011-0004","City":"Glendale"}
