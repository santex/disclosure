(so strange) i have had many disturbing experiences throughout my entire life. one of the worst experiences is having had severe nosebleeds and fungal infections following an bad encounter. i was told that i would never remember anything but i recall a lot in complete detail and other things are slightly foggy. things have been very quite for approx. twelve years and now i am experiencing loss in time,night terror, dancing wavy lights in my room at night and other strange events. anyone else suffering like this? regards,"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"33182","Region":"Louisiana"}
