I only observed them for around 15 minutes. There was no way they were planes or helicopters. This morning at 3:30am I went to let my dog outside, and when I looked up to the sky (north east)I noticed a dot of light moving across the sky too fast and too high up to be an airplane.... I didn���t see cylinders, fireballs, a saucer, or a sphere. It looked like a star in the distance [very small] and would suddenly start to travel at a high speed, then slow down into erratic maneuvers, and frequently coming to stops. It would resume in a straight line at a high speed and suddenly make a sharp turn��� Once it got further up in the sky it did a 3 point triangular pattern, went backwards, zig zagged, took sharp turn left and and headed that way for a short distance. It then headed down and back up again a few times... It even did circular and oval patterned maneuvers. It stopped often but seemed to be getting further away and higher up in the sky. When stationary the light seemed to resemble a still source of white light, but when resuming motion it would flicker colors at a rate a bit faster than the twinkle of the stars. The flicker rate was never the same, sometimes faster, sometimes slower. It glided like a mouse cursor as it travelled across the sky at a 45 degree angle. I didn't have a camera handy. I wanted to continue observing but it was 4am, so I went to bed. I felt very amazed. A bit concerned about their purpose though. I wish I had a powerful telescope to see more detail."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"18146","trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Edmonton","There were no other sightings in Edmonton on or around July 17th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"07/17/2009 03:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/17/2009 03:30 UTC","Country":"Canada","Summary":"dot of light tavelling at high speed across morning sky and moving erratically and made sudden stops","Region":"Alberta","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"CA-07182009-0002","Longitude":"-113.486092","Latitude":"53.545884","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18146.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18146.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","City":"Edmonton"}
