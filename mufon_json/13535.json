{"Country":"Canada","Case Number":"13535","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Mother Ship Addendum","Log Number":"CA-11042008-0019","divs":["Sighting DetailsAfter some more processing for more detail of the mother ship, I am submitting to you the original video footage of the 23X Sport Scope near infrared observation of a mother ship several miles up in the air. This is rather raw footage, so don't get ill from the telescope bouncing around... I am also attaching a bitmap picture (processed for detail). I believe this will be one of the most highest quality pictures of a mother ship that MUFON has ever received. It is 89 megabytes in size. It should be competitive in resolution to a military spy satellite photograph, and invaluable for research purposes. In addition, I am attaching a jpg picture separately of this Mother ship observed on November 3, in case people cannot open the uncompressed bitmap picture contained in the zip file due to memory of computer restrictions.
