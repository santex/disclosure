I watch the sky a lot. I was a Mufon member for a year but didn't think much of Walt. Still active in groups. An object like the Slida, CO event of 1996 appeared SE of my land traveling slowly north. The sun was over my right shoulder starting to turn orange. Object was very bright white. At 10,000 ft it would have been the size of a 747 moving at less that 100 miles an hour. At 40,000 ft it would have been a quarter mile long. Could not tell. Have already talked to Gary Hart about sighting."]}
