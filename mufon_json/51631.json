{"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10182013-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 2:00 am I had been watching tv when I heard a stray dog that hangs out in the neighborhood screeching and running down the street . I went to the kitchen window to see what the problem was and as I looked out the window I noticed what at first I thought was a bright star in the sky to the south east but as I stood looking at it I realized that not only was it too bright to be a star but there was at least 5 lights across that were moving . At first the lights seemed to be flashing but then they were moving across the object .Then it looked as though the lights would separate and then go back together I watched it for several minutes to make sure of what I was seeing . I was excited about seeing the lights but also a little fearful .I called my daughter who lives around the corner from me and told her what I was looking at and we decided to meet at the corner so that she could see it too and make sure I wasn't looking at just bright stars. As I walked out my door and out into the street I realized that there was another one to the west of the first one and as I walked to the corner I saw another one They were not close together but I am not sure how far apart they were . When my daughter met me she verified that what I was seeing was not stars . She brought her camera and tried to get pictures and video but her camera didn't have a very far range zoom . I don't have a video camera any longer since I loaned it to someone about 4 years ago and have not seen it since . Don't ever loan a video camera to someone who you cannot trust cause you never know when you may need it . We stood for about 30 minutes watching the UFOs and the first one seemed to be getting closer as we watched it . The third one was slowly moving back and the second one to the west looked as though it was moving closer as well . When we saw them getting closer we decided it was time to go inside and we went home in a hurry. The UFOs were moving really slowly as though they were looking for something or watching something . That's just our observation .When I came back into the house I went to look out the window to see where they were and the first one was directly overhead and I could not see the other ones . After a few minutes the first one slowly moved on till I could no longer see it . This is not the first sighting that I have had nor the second . A couple of years ago as my mother and I were returning home we saw a cloud , the only cloud in the sky and it was shaped like a saucer . It was sitting directly over a small pasture . Then some time after that I'm not sure how long but we saw it again , the cloud shaped like a saucer . It was strange the way it was shaped both times and both times it was the only cloud in the sky but it wasn't that high up in the sky . I know what my daughter and I saw this morning are UFOs there were no planes or helicopters in the sky and I have never seen an airplane or helicopter just sit in one place for very long .Also I have never felt fear at seeing airplanes or helicopters ."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Porterville","There were no other sightings in Porterville on or around October 18th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Circle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/18/2013 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Summary":"my daughter and I saw the first set of lights out the kitchen window went outside to make sure we were not looking at stars","Date Submitted":"10/18/2013 06:26 UTC","City":"Porterville","Case Number":"51631","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51631.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51631.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-119.001764","Latitude":"36.051175","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.051175,+-119.001764(51631)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51631) map </A>"}
