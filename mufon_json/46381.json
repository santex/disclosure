While tking I was looking East and saw something inthe sky emiting sparks trailing a craft I thought to be an airplane in trouble. It was moving what would appear to be slow, but at it's hight and distance would and did look like a jet. When it got in front of us I could see no wings and thought the sparks looked like a childs sparklers on the 4th of july. I watched it for a few minutes as it disapeart in the western sky; At no time did this craft change from it's flight path. I would guess it took 5 minutes to go from E to W. I would guess it was 3 miles out and 3000 ft up."]}
