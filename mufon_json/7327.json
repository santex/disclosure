(i have recently tested my hearing and it is perfect.) i am sensitive to feelings, particularly \"hostile\" or \"negative\" ones but felt entirely peaceful during the experience, no excitement, no apprehension, just a feeling of \"calm awe\". i leave you to make up your own mind what could have taken place that night - i simply do not know."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7327.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"11/30/1983 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-33.924868,+18.424055(7327)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7327) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"-33.924868","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Cape Town","There were no other sightings in Cape Town on or around November 30th 1983"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
