At that point figured it may have been a satellite although really did not look like one. About 10 minutes went by and saw it again, my daughter was with me thankfully because I would have thought I was going crazy if she did not see it also. Took a pic on my phone but it did not turn out well."],"City":"Charlotte","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"17842","Region":"North Carolina","Latitude":"35.233377","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 11:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.233377,+-80.833157(17842)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17842) map </A>","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 11:30 UTC"}
