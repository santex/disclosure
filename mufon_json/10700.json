FLOATING over the city of Cleveland GA. It was moving from North to the South,slowly,and quietly. I watched for only a short time,as I had to get to work in Gainesville GA. I was surprised at how calm I was. It seemed to be a MATALIC GREY (but it was still dark outside so I couldn't be sure of color ! The LIGHTS from a shopping center was reflecting off of it ,and without that I don't know if I would have even noticed IT at all. I can't say ! There isn't much more to say about the incident. I seemed to just take everything in stride,as if these things happened to me every day (which they don't)"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Cleveland","There were no other sightings in Cleveland on or around November 30th 1998"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.60221,+-83.755777(10700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10700) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10700.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10700.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10700.html"]}
