(my theory on this- 1. shooting star by chance in the same area 2. it flew directly away from me and i saw it follow the curve of the planet at some crazy speed which made it look like a shooting star.. coolest thing that i'll probably never see again! here's the kicker.. about two weeks later saw a show on the \"aurora\" (discovery).. about 5 years after the sighting, i saw the \"belguim ufo\" on the internet. i can confirm, the belgium video is the exact craft i saw.. i will provide a link to the vid.. http:\\\\video.google.com\\videosearch?hl=en&q=belguim%20ufo&um=1&ie=utf-8&sa=n&tab=wv# 1st video- the triagle of lights were exactly the same as i saw.."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12523.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12523.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 1st 1997"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"03/01/1997 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-111.981678","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"3 orange lights making triangle formation flew from north to southeast","Log Number":"US-09172008-0018","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Phoenix","Latitude":"33.488542","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"12523","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.488542,+-111.981678(12523)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12523) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
