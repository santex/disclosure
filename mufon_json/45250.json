I was laying down on the ground. The shooting star left a gray tail very small object the size of a golf ball in the sky. It looked like it was a few hundred feet above the ground. It was a bright white light then dissappeared after 1 or 2 seconds. the object continued like it was space debris and due to it appearing close to earth I waited to hear it make an impact. It was on the same trajectory as the flight path going south east towards San Diego. This occurred sometime around 10 p.m. 1-15-13 p.s.t. If it was a meteorite the debris could have potentially landed somewhere in the Encinitas area."],"Case Number":"45250","City":"Undisclosed"}
