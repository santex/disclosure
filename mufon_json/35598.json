{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Massachusetts","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving east on 195 the object looked to be a few miles away to the east. First I thought it was a star, then I thought it was a plane, then I thought it was a helicopter. Once it got over 195 it followed the highway going west. As it was approaching the highway I could tell it was not a helicopter. As it got over me I could clearly see a large triangle shaped object with a metal surface and 5 large white lights."],"Date Submitted":"02/10/2012 12:20 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Triangle, 5 large white lights, one small green & one small red flashing light","Case Number":"35598","City":"Seekonk","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02102012-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35598.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35598.html"],"Latitude":"41.82031","Longitude":"-71.329718","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Seekonk","There were no other sightings in Seekonk on or around February 9th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.82031,+-71.329718(35598)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35598) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/09/2012 11:50 UTC"}
