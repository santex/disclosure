Just looked up to see if it was cloudy. Noticed a bright light that looked like a star except in was moving in jerky motions, back and forth, then stopping, then darting forward and then in reverse. As I watched I realised that there were atleast 5 or 6 more in the sky. Very high altitude, but you could tell they were triangle in shape as the night sky was a different shade than the object. Then I relized that as the objects moved, it appeared they were emitting very dull sparkes, that appeared to be filling in the sky. Watched on and off for an hour."],"Case Number":"51233","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51233.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51233.html"],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Roanoke","There were no other sightings in Roanoke on or around September 24th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"09/24/2013 06:30 UTC","Summary":"triangle craft. moved quickly in all directions","Date Submitted":"10/01/2013 06:45 UTC","Latitude":"37.259537","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.259537,+-79.913002(51233)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51233) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Roanoke"}
