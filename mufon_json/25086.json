{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a normal day in Taganga (SantaMarta - Colombia)at the beach. I was taking some pictures of my friends and then i realized that there was a white shining around the sun, visible with UV filter lenses as i had on my sunglasses. So I decided to take some pictures of that using the inner ND filter of my Cannon G11. When i replayed the pics on the visor of the camera i thought i was seeng a damaged pixel con the screen, but i zoomed and i found this triangular shaped \"something\". It's clearly too high to be a plane and too triangular for any known aircrafts. This picture has a little Photoshop on it, just color and saturation corrections. I've kept the original for future studies if anyone's interested."],"Log Number":"CO-08132010-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=11.25059,+-74.17255(25086)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25086) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Santa Marta","There were no other sightings in Santa Marta on or around April 28th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25086.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25086_submitter_file1__UFO-en-Taganga.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25086.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-74.17255","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"25086","City":"Santa Marta","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"UFO photographed in Taganga, Santamarta -Colombia.","Region":"Magdalena","Latitude":"11.25059","Date of the Event":"04/28/2010 10:30 UTC","Country":"Colombia","Date Submitted":"08/13/2010 12:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
