I went onto the back deck and had an overwhelming feeling of being watched. I looked up in the sky and saw a round bright object I thought might be a star, but felt very strange like I knew someone or something was watching me. I picked up on the object right away and felt intimidated so I turned the back flood light on. The object started moving very fast and then disappeared like turning a light off. I still felt like I was being watched so I got the dogs in the house and locked everything up. This is not the first time this has happened with seeing strange objects in the sky. It is always in the direction over the bay. I have caught several things on camera that I cannot explain. I never read too much activity in Md area though, so I sort of keep quiet about it and just continue to observe and keep the photos."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/17/2008 10:15 UTC","Region":"Maryland","Summary":"Round bright object","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/17/2008 10:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.5404,+-76.584402(11212)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11212) map </A>","Longitude":"-76.584402","City":"Prince Frederick","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
