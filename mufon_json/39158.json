{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend took this photo about 2 years ago, at the time he was down south on holiday when he decided to take a panoramic photo of lake Hawea which is just outside of Wanaka, it was not until he got home and downloaded it onto his computer that he noticed this object he did not recognize flying just above the mountain. This was the last photo in a series of shots and it was taken at 1000th of a second. The object can be seen flying just above the mountain top on the left hand side of the photo. Looking closer at this image it appears as though the bottom part of it is glowing orange."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/11/2012 01:32 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"39158","Summary":"this photo was taken by a friend who now resides in Greece","Latitude":"-44.696887","Longitude":"169.131426","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-44.696887,+169.131426(39158)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39158) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39158.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/39158_submitter_file1__IMG9327.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39158.html"],"Log Number":"NZ-06112012-0002","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"New Zealand","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval","Tags":"City","City":"Wanaka","Date of the Event":"02/02/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"Otago","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wanaka","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
