I knew it was'nt an ordinary air-craft when I noticed it did not blink. It was moving at the speed of an airplane. It shined the color of white for I believe ten seconds but then it would pulsate I believe the color blue. I was hoping that it would stop and hover but It was heading southeast from maryland. I felt glorified and excited but then I became a little sick. I lost sight of the object when it flew behind some trees."],"Latitude":"39.116332","Country":"United States"}
