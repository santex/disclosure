Its flew from the west to the east. it must be a very high altitude I mention it looks very big, compare to a airplane from a couple of mm to the distance of 10 cm. on front of the two shadows was a flashing light very slow flying it make a halve circle. At an higher altitude i saw like a star flying what i saw often in the past time. I was very excited and scared in the same time, because they must be really Big. I really dont know what's going on there ....?"],"Date Submitted":"11/18/1955 01:30 UTC"}
