At the same time I was thinking \"reveal yourself\". I waited for about 5 minutes photographing the sunset. I saw a dark object in the sky about 35 degrees up and took photos of it. I used a Canon 30D with a dusty 17-85mm lens. First photo was when I was using full zoom. This is not dust on the lense, I saw the object first and then started to photograph it. At the time I did not use RAW photos as the camera was \"new\" for me. Time between first and last photo is about 6 minutes. Object was keeping same speed, altitude and heading. I saw it coming from the east and it passed going north west. Lost sight of it as it became to small to see. I was happy seeing something else than airplanes, that was what I was looking for. I think it was a weather balloon but it had some rods sticking out and oval shape. If it was a weather balloon it should probably reflect light or be a bit transperent. I contacted UFO.se but they dismissed it as \"birds\" wich I know is very unlikly. It could have been a weather balloon but I���ll let you decide."],"Log Number":"SE-01132011-0007","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/31/2008 07:55 UTC","Summary":"Like a balloon but with diagonal rods"}
