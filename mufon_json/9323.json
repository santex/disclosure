After a storm, I was out taking pix of the mountains, with the clouds rolling over them. I took lots of pix and did not go thru them until I got home and had downloaded them on to my computer. I did not notice this unidentified object until I was looking thru the photos on my laptop. It does not look like a bird and it appears to have a strong shadow underneath it. I am not claiming it's a UFO, but it doesn't look like anything I recognize. Do you know anyone that can analyze this photo and give an opinion?"],"Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9323.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9323_submitter_file1__ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9323.html"],"Latitude":"34.151508","Log Number":"US-01282008-0013","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Glendale","There were no other sightings in Glendale on or around January 27th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.248565"}
