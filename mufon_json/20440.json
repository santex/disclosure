One appeared larger and brighter than the other and the other two appeared about the same size. All of them appeared to be falling toward the Earth, which is what caught our attention -- their trails weren't horizontal like an airplane's. Gradually, the larger one's trail grew smaller as it fell toward the horizon and the other two appeared to merge together as they fell. At first we thought it was space debris but it when the objects merged together, we changed our minds. Throughout the event, we felt no fear or anxiety -- just excitement and curiousity -- and we flipped to a 24 hours news station but there wasn't anything about what we'd seen. After about 7 minutes, the objects reached the treeline and we could no longer see them."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/07/2009 05:00 UTC","Region":"Virginia","City":"Chantilly","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Chantilly","There were no other sightings in Chantilly on or around November 7th 2009"],"Latitude":"38.894279"}
