So I took several pictures approximately four and the camera auto focused and I lost the object. Approximately 10 minutes later I saw the glowing orb and took a couple photos of it heading in a different direction and approximately 5 minutes later 3 military F-16 jets flew overhead on the same flight path as the commercial jetliner."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-112.001979","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Circle, Saturn-like","Country":"United States","Case Number":"20388","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"11/08/2009 05:16 UTC"}
