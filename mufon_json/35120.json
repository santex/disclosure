{"Case Number":"35120","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsi personally did not have this experience. but i feel that it is time to make this public to examine if anyone else has had this experience. it took place in south west wisconsin on the border with illinois. this takes place in about a quarter mile from the ufo hotspot where i have seen a reptoid\\cloaked being, triangular ufo's, and orbs and will extrapolate that in the next sighting report. r-- was sleeping in his bed when he was woken by his dog that was barking that was in his bedroom with him. he looked up and saw a 3 foot tall reptoid crouching on his nightstand, clicking at him with disgust. it then darted off. hopefully he can get on here to post a full report, but i felt that it was necessary to put this on here to start discussion if anyone else has witnessed reptilian\\reptoid creatures. there's so much crud on the internet i felt it was necessary to get a real story about reptilians out."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35120.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35120.html"],"Summary":"I did not have this experience, but feel it is time it is reported.","Region":"Wisconsin","Date Submitted":"01/25/2012 12:37 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/01/2009 02:01 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.79123,+-88.778298(35120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35120) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01252012-0001","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.79123","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-88.778298","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
