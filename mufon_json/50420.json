It moved in a straight path parallel to the treetops and stopped (an index finger length when held up to the sky). Minutes later is quickly ascended straight up (a thumbs length)and a couple seconds later descended straight down to its original position. It was stationary for minutes. Then it moved in a straight path parallel to the treetops heading south. I'm thinking this is weird and surely the planes I can see going by can see this thing. The white light was very large and almost blinding through binoculars. I had the impression that there was movement, whirring lights within the major brightness and there was pulsating colors but the white light was so bright it was hard to tell the movement. It moved south and higher in the sky and once again stationary. At the same time another one more distant, staying in the lower NE area of sky, was moving around every direction. Then the clouds moved in. It gave one a strange feeling and I thought if it was a UFO type thing-it just better not come my way."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50420.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50420.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2013 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"50420","Summary":"bright star-like: traveled, hovered, shot up and down, hovered, traveled, hovered","City":"Camden, MI into Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-09042013-0010","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.438272","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Camden, MI into Ohio","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
