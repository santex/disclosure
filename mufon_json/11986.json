I watched thinking it a jet when I realized that the lights were flashing erractically and were multicolored. I continued to watch and also noticed that it was not always traveling in a straight line, but at times would zig zag and then go straight and it repeated this behavior until it just vanished before my eyes! As it passed over me I expected to hear a sound indicated I was mistaking a jet for something else, but no sound was ever heard."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/06/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-97.129248","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.221441","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11986.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11986.html"],"Log Number":"US-08082008-0012","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/06/2008 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.221441,+-97.129248(11986)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11986) map </A>","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Denton","There were no other sightings in Denton on or around August 6th 2008"]}
