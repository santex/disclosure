{"Source":"MUFON","City":"Mesa","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Feb. 10, 2011 between the hours of 11am - 11:30am I was relaxing in my hottub looking east.I observed a single luminous object which traveled from east to west then paired up with another luminous object which appeared to be almost stationary. The second object was noticed only because I was tracking the first object. Also, because it was slightly behind me @ 1:00 position. Detailed version: On a perfect clear day while relaxing in my hot tub at approximately 11:10AM I noticed a luminous object traveling west to southwest. I didn���t see any wings on it or a trail behind it like an airplane, this caught my attention. It was at a extreme altitude, and would of went un-noticed if I wasn���t wearing sunglasses. I tracked this object as it slowly started to change direction to northwest. With binoculars I tracked it over head,and I couldn't hear any type of engine noise. This object had no wings, and a very bright white light on the bottom.This light did blink, but not in a regular constant on-off pattern. As this object past overhead, and past the roof line I moved to get a better view. I was now looking towards west @1:00 position.I called my 22 year old daughter outside of the house to witness what I was seeing. The first object I was tracking paired up with another luminous object that went un-noticed until up to this point. The two objects I observed with binoculars seemed to be stationary with a short distance between them. They appeared like two stars in the daytime sky for about 5 to 10 minutes. My daughter and I watched these two objects until they slowly went out of view."],"Date Submitted":"02/23/2011 11:33 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.421434,+-111.828402(27959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27959) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27959.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27959.html"],"Latitude":"33.421434","Case Number":"27959","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around February 10th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"00:15:10","Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02232011-0005","Summary":"two luminious objects pairing up one stationary and one that moved from east to west to meet up with the one that appeared to be stationary","Date of the Event":"02/10/2011 11:05 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-111.828402"}
