My oldest son was across the street being a complicated teenager. My youngest son and I were looking across the street in my oldest sons direction when suddenly we saw this extremely bright light descending from a very high altitude at a very fast pace. It was one big ball of light. It resembled a star. As it was falling a second smaller light came off but continued falling down close to the bigger light. We no longer saw it after it fell pass the trees. My son and I stood stunned. After about a half a minute we both asked each other did you just see that. I honestly don't know what I saw. I know that I've never seen anything like that before. We stay close to an airport so I know what planes, etc look like and that wasn't it. If it wasn't a UFO maybe it was flares or something, I don't know."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Lake Charles","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
