{"Region":"Maryland","Date of the Event":"07/15/1973 08:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"07/15/1973 08:30 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsa friend and i had gone fishing one evening in july 1973 on a private estate located on the eastern shore of maryland. the estate is located on land next to a tributary which opens in to the chesapeake bay. my friends parents were the groundskeepers of the estate. my friend and his family also lived in a house on the property. at about dusk we were sitting on a section of bulk head with fishing lines in the water, a portable radio playing near by, radio volume low. my friend's car was parked approx. 3-4 feet behind us with the passenger and driver's side doors open - the dome light inside the car was lit. behind the car was an open field - no vegetation at the time - on the opposite side of the field approx. 50 yards was a wooded area. at one point i happened to glance over my right shoulder and noticed a light in the woods. the light was about the size, color and intensity of a large flashlight. it was moving through the woods waist high from the ground - moving at about walking speed. at the time, the first thing i thought was that my friend's father was walking through the woods with a flashlight. i didnt pay it any particular attention and turned my head back in the direction of my fishing line and the water. looking back on the event i realize now there would have been no reason for his father to be in the woods at that hour much less with a flashlight in hand. approx. 1-2 minutes later i glanced back again toward the direction where i had previously seen the light - now i could see the light had left the wooded tree line and was moving across the field in a direct straight path towards my friend and i. i nudged my friend on the elbow and said: \"look at that\". we could see the light was an orb about the size or slightly larger than a softball. glowing a white\\yellow color - not particulary bright. the shape of the orb was perfectly round. the light contained within. the surface of the orb was not smooth but had a rather fuzzy appearance. just a perfect sphere of light. as it crossed the field towards us - it moved at about walking pace and was about waist high from the ground. no sound. it simply floated through the air in a very straight path. by now my friend and i had dropped our fishing poles and was standing up. we watched the orb approach his car as if it were very interested in the car itself - it hovered over the roof of the car as if it were \"checking it out\" and\\or us. it seemed to be very curious. it hovered approx. 1-2 minutes then began to slowly move off to the right toward some nearby trees. when it reached the trees - it climbed to tree top level and moved over the top of the trees. that's where we lost sight of it. i can remember as we were watching the orb hover above his car literally a few feet away i could see my friend out of my peripheral vision - he and i were absolutely frozen with fear. we could not move. after we lost sight of the orb we immediately got in his car and drove the very short distance to his parents house and told them what we had just witnessed. we left the radio and fishing gear behind. an hour or so later he, his mother, father, sister and i walked in to their front yard and looked up towards the sky. now it was dark and you could see stars. at about the altitude of say where a jet would fly was a dark triangular shaped craft with large white round lights along two edges of the triangle. the craft would travel at what appeared to be a short distance at that high of an altitude at an incredible rate of speed, literally stop on a dime then make sharp right angled turns. we watched for a few minutes then eventually the craft moved straight up until we lost sight of it. the story can be documented as my mother called the local newspaper the next day to report what we had seen. i remember seeing a very small article in the paper within the next day or so. i have not been back to the sight since that evening however i have located the exact spot where this occured on google earth."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.795705,+-76.214607(11594)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11594) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07162008-0008","trends":["There has been one other sighting in St Michaels","There were no other sightings in St Michaels on or around July 15th 1973"],"Longitude":"-76.214607","Case Number":"11594","City":"St Michaels","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11594.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11594.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Approached by Glowing Orb -
