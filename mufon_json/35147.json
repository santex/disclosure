I had many unusual experiences throughout my life which I think are unexplainable. I have been thinking since long time to talk to someone professional regarding this but never had the courage to do so. I am 28 years old Punjabi girl, basically from Mumbai, living in Australia since 3 years for study. The first unusual experience I had during my childhood, I don���t remember the exact year, but I think I was 10-11 years old at that time. That night, I went to sleep as usual, when I got up I had very strange memories about being carried away by someone in space. They took me with them while I was sleeping; I was walking with them. I can���t remember the faces of the beings, but they were similar to humans as I have very blurred vision about that. I was laid down, and they inserted something on my collar bone. They pushed it inside my skin using long, thin needle-like equipment. It was painful. When I got up in the morning, for 10-20 minutes I was stunned and thinking about what happened last night. I couldn���t believe that anything like that can happen; as I never heard anything like that I thought it was just a bad dream. I remember, I was looking through the window, and I thought it is not possible for someone to come from the sky as there was so less gap between the two buildings. Then I went to look up in the mirror, I saw there is a scar on my collar bone. I was very scared, and couldn���t believe it was true. I tried to convince myself what I think about the scar is not true, and the memories I remember was just a bad dream. After that, I started getting depressed about things and lost interest in studying. I was thinking suicidal at that time, lost interest in living in this world. I had bad nightmares and was too scared to go to school. I hurt myself by cutting my hand with blades, pen. My parents took me took to Psychiatrist and after some time my health was improved. After 2- 3 years of depression, I was good , I got very fat due to my over-eating in depression, I became like 90 kgs, I made up my mind and I lost 40 kgs in one year. I worked in film industry as a junior artist for some time, and then I started studying again and still studying. I had some unusual experiences like feeling of knowing something before, out of body experiences but I never paid much attention to these things as I didn���t really want to think about those things. In the year 2008, I was travelling to go to 2 institutes to enquire about a course. While I was travelling, I suddenly started feeling happy and my mind said me that today you are going to get a job offer from an institute. When I went to the first institute, the counselor really offered me a job offer. I was truly amazed at that time, and felt how can a feeling become true. I was also puzzled that it was a feeling or a message by someone. Then in the end of the year 2009, my brother was engaged with a girl and they were together since 7-8 months and were soon going to get married. Everything was going good and preparations for the marriage were started at my house. A week before the marriage, I got a vision; I can't really explain that vision. It was more like a feeling or message, and what I interpreted from that message was that my brother will not get married and i uttered those words from the mouth. During that message, I also saw a monkey like being. My husband was also sitting with me when this thing happened and he heard what i said. Then I just got confused of what i said and I told my husband why i am feeling bad about my brother, I shouldn���t be thinking like that. I felt it was just a thought of mind and nothing else. But the next day, I got a call from my father that my brother���s engagement is broken and he is not going to get married. It was shocking as it shows there is some kind of connection between mind and reality. In the year 2010, one day I was just sitting and feeling sad about mother and don���t know why I was feeling like it. After few hours a call from my mom on my phone, and I was just too scared to attend that call. I started crying in front of my husband and told him it is a bad news, I don���t want to hear the bad news. I am normal and have never done anything like this crazy before without any valid reason. I don���t know why I behaved like that. I talked to my mom for an hour or so and was so happy that my mom is good and nothing really has happened to her. But then after 2 days I got a call from home, again that feeling started. I thought to ignore the feeling and attended the call. This time my brother was calling to give bad news about my mom. She had a stroke, she was serious and hospitalized. I was very sad to hear this news, and was pretty confused about the connection between the mind and reality. The above stated are the most prominent ones, other than that I had out of body experiences a couple of times that I remember. The situation at present is that I am puzzled about life and reality. Health wise presently, sometimes I can feel some kind of pressure in the middle of the eyebrows flowing towards the nose. I got swelling in my legs; especially my left knee is swollen and painful since 2 years, also I feel very tired even after doing light work. I am not sure whether these symptoms are related to the abduction or not but I am more concerned about the scar I have. I would like to further investigate into this matter but have no idea where to start and who will be the best person to contact regarding this matter. I have attached the pictures of the implant scar; it is right over my collar bone. Please ignore the stretch marks near the scar, as I got that after losing my weight. Any help regarding this will be appreciated."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"This is regarding a alien abduction case which I experienced many years back in India, I got a scar on the collar bone after waking up from bed.","Log Number":"IN-01252012-0028","Country":"India","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"73.082762","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/25/2012 10:16 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"35147","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dombivli","This sighting has been favorited 2 times."],"Latitude":"19.214232","Region":"Maharashtra"}
