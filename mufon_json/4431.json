{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["sighting detailsremote area of south gulf cove preserve placida florida. my wife and myself were walking our dog. very clear day, many hawks circling drew my eye to the cigar shaped ufo over the trees (trees approximately 1\\2 mile away). the ufo was tilted very slightly left end higher. it had rouned ends and no visible tail or wings. same thickness from end to end. i had no idea what is was. the sun glinted off it. i watched it because it seemed to be at a banking angle but was not moving. i called my wife's attention to it. she sighted it as it moved very quickly left to right and was obscurred by a tree in the distance. we ran up the road to see more. i saw it briefly and turned to my wife to see if she could see it. she stated that it had just took off at a very very fast rate towards the south east. i did not see this exit. after, i saw a small aircraft in the same vacinity and it it was easily descernable as a small aircraft. i tried to convince myself that what i had seen was a plane, but the more i thought about it, the more i could not convince myself."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"02/15/2006 11:25 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4431.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4431.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"sighted not moving initially.
