I asked her if it is a Airplane or Helicopter or Ballon , she said no, nothing, something others. I searched for myself this object through the window and found out she's right. I call my wife and she came and saw the same object. We opened the window and looked through a telescope and then I took the camera and did some photos. The object looks like a probe and we all have never seen such a object in the sky before. The object rotate slowly and has sometimes a butterfly look. It looks like not made on earth so to speak. We run on the highest floor in our house to see more, we could see this object around 5 minute and we lost it in the landscape."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"ThÃ¼ringen","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.337573,+11.235663(32830)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32830) map </A>","Country":"Germany","City":"Bretleben","Longitude":"11.235663","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Sighting of UFO flyby"}
