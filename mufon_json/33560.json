I saw a red object at a low altitude (that is what made me notice it and its size). I thought was a banner or balloon, but is wasn���t moving and there was no airplane or helicopter around. About 10 minutes later I saw a helicopter flying in the sky (but it was actually moving and getting further) that was black. The object I saw had a reflection because of the sun. It looked shiny and not dull like the helicopter. It was not moving when I saw it."],"Longitude":"-98.489908","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33560.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33560.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/23/2011 09:58 UTC","Latitude":"29.425892","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cone","Summary":"Saw a reflective, red object at low altitude","City":"San Antonio","Log Number":"US-11232011-0014","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/23/2011 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around November 23rd 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"33560","Country":"United States"}
