The first one, which I got a good pic of, was very close, Id say less 200 feet, maybe less. There is low cloud cover tonight, they came in low, and from the north. The next two objects were a little higher up, it is one of those that is in the video, Now, the video IS in HD......What it needs is STILL FRAME ZOOM ANALYSIS.......In the still image I have sent, you can clearly see the shape of the object. They are not actually spheres, that's just how they LOOK..........."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"three red glowing objects one after the other in 10 min. span","City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47814.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47814.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States"}
