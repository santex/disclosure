We've both seen this craft several times since, but the sightings stopped before New Years 2008. Around March 10th of this year, I heard the same sound that accompanied this craft over our house again. It was shortly after midnight, and I was watching television inside. I ran outside, and saw the craft over the house. I thought it was military, but it was too large to be of Earth origin. It was y-shaped, 100 yards long, but moved slowly, almost in a hover. It was dark, covered with what resembled hull plating, and had a large band of blue lights along its midsection. It made a sound like a very low hum, which you could feel in your chest. The craft hovered for a few minutes, then moved slowly from west to east, until it was no longer in my range of vision. The first time it was sighted, we were perplexed. Now we're concerned, because of the frequency of the sightings since. The craft seemed very interested in our residence and our neighbors'. On every night before we've seen the craft, we felt like we were being watched. The feeling that makes the hair on your neck stand on end."],"Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"03/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Large craft and unique sound sighted several times.","Tags":"City","Case Number":"10149","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.64449,+-86.864732(10149)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10149) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-04032008-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10149.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10149.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10149.html"],"City":"Greencastle","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Indiana","Longitude":"-86.864732","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Other"}
