{"divs":["Sighting Detailsmy father and mother and myself were working in the yard finishing up the lawn when i noticed a light like a airliner on approach to hector air port in fargo ND aprox 25 miles from my house.I went back to cleaning up stuff thinking the jet will be over head soon,when i looked again in 5 mins it was not as close as it should have been so being a airplane nut it peaked my curiosity and i began watching closer,when it finaly gotten closer i told my dad to look and my mother also, and we all stood under this thing as it glided over us blocking the sky as it passed it was a diamond shape or like a hopeless diamond lifting body type but absolutly quiet, the cockpit was backlit and was a wraparound like a b2 bomber cockpit.we were stunned and didnt speak a word about it until the next day when i couldnt take it anymore,my father was a career army man started on the beach at normandy to vietnam and was in army intel in germany and said he had never seen anything like it ever,my mother was in the army also and attached to white sands nm and had been to all the v2 tests with a doctor colonel and took notes for him and had seen all sorts of craft but never like this thing, we talked about it and concluded we had seen a ufo, we were changed people, we new that either our government was producing craft that was no were near what was being seen ie f-15 or any other hi tech planes,or we seen a real craft from not of this earth or time. i am 42 yrs old now and i am not sure of the dates but i called my mother tonight and asked about it and she sounded shocked that i brought this up and she said she thinks about that night often we think it was between 1976-1979 but in the summer around july"],"Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8430.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8430.html"],"Object Shape":"Diamond, Triangle","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Barnesville","There were no other sightings in Barnesville on or around July 17th 1978"],"Date of the Event":"07/17/1978 10:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-11222007-0007","City":"Barnesville","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/17/1978 10:05 UTC","Summary":"silent,wrap around cockpit,black,5 to10 mph,200ft height diamond","Longitude":"-96.41203","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"8430","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Window(s)","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"01:13:10","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.655972,+-96.41203(8430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8430) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"46.655972"}
