I knew it was no plane the instant I saw it. It had no wings, lights or anything else on it that I could see. It had three vertical markings on it, just lines of some sort. There was an airplane in the fore ground between me and the object. The airplane was traveling in the same direction as the object but the object was moving much faster. It just glided in the sky for about 30 seconds and I was trying to see it while driving. I looked at the road and back and it was gone. At that my graddaught asked me what that was in the sky and I asked her if she was talking about the airplane and she told me no and that she was talking about the \"other thing\". I told her I did not know. I got chill bumps when she asked me that."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Lewisville","There were no other sightings in Lewisville on or around May 17th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10875.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10875.html"],"Log Number":"US-05222008-0008","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Tags":"City","City":"Lewisville","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"05/17/2008 11:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/17/2008 11:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"33.056023","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-96.987894","Case Number":"10875","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Summary":"Metallic silver, No wings, moving very fast over I35 in Lewisville, TX"}
