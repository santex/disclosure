I notice a very fast object moving across the morning sky at an incredible speed,faster than any jet. It went horizontally from east to west at about 25-30 degrees elevation. I would estimate that It was as bright and the size of a cars halogen headlight at 150 yard. It lasted only a second and then it was gone. I looked down at my watch and it was 4:59am. It made no sound and left no trail."],"Date Submitted":"10/05/2011 08:04 UTC","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Log Number":"US-10052011-0009","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
