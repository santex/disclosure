I had told every one i met of this event and most have laughed and I wanted to come fort only because I want to learn more and I want others to also share their experiences, thank you."],"Weather Factors":"None","City":"Sierra Vista","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"31.5517","Summary":"triangle shaped object came from behind mountain and passed over head, close view of object","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.5517,+-110.273386(21237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21237) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown"}
