I thought that they were fireworks and I pointed them out to the other passenger in the car and he recognized them also. We kept driving down the road when I noticed that the \"fireworks\" were not dissolving. We came to a clearing where there we no trees and we noticed that these lights were hovering in air. I tried to take a picture while moving in the car but did not get a very good shot. I do have a photograph of these lights and you can see in the picture that they were moving at that time. I did not feel scared, I felt calm and just wanted to find out more about these objects. I lost sight of the lights when they appeared to have vanished."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Rochester","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/28/2012 10:10 UTC","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around July 28th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Red lights in sky"}
