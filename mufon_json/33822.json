This things looked mean like real deal fighter jets. The flew directly over head at low altitude ( could see good detail on the jets. Bigger than thumb at arms length. They were flying low enough the sound was deafening and I had to plug my ears due to pain. I clearly saw 3 jets fly SW. Then it seemed a another craft manifested. It appeared to have no wings and flew into the sunset at west. It was cigar shaped. The jets made definite sound as the flew away from the cigar but there was no sound coming from cigars direction. There has been a lot of military black helicopters, two wing helicopters and jets over okc lately. Also pusating light ufos hovering and that flew physically impossible on the 30th november just a few days ago. And everyone I talked has seen odd lights and craft almost every night in november. Something is definitely going on in okc."],"Summary":"3 fighter jets in formation over okc. Cigar shape appeared and flew into sunset","Longitude":"-97.594297","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
