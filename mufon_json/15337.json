I had noticed a couple of satellites fly over when; out the corner of my eye I saw a very slow moving what I thought was a satellite. But upon a closer look I noticed two other lights, two at the front and one to the rear. I couldn���t believe my eyes. They were moving in a northerly direction. There is no doubt these three lights were connected, they moved in exact time with each other and formed the perfect triangle. It was breath taking. This triangle shape craft seemed to be at a high altitude like a 747 air plane but was 5 to 10 times the size of any passenger plane I have ever seen. As it passed in front of different stars I could still see them but the stars seemed a little fuzzy. Weird I know but that���s what I saw. It was a breath taking sight. I witnessed this craft for about 40 to 50 sec and then ran inside to tell my partner. We both rushed outside to witness the craft but unfortunately I could only just see the craft fad into the distance, in a north east direction. An awesome moment!"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"144.283746","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bendigo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Bendigo","Summary":"Triangle shape with three lights.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-36.758711,+144.283746(15337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15337) map </A>","Region":"Victoria","Case Number":"15337","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"AU-02062009-0005","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"-36.758711","Date of the Event":"02/06/2009 10:48 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/06/2009 10:48 UTC"}
