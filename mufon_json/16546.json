That night she told me to go some places to take pictures and we went to a place called more or less, Takepalake. There are stores and restaurants, but at that time every thing was closed. She told me to sit at the border of a water fountain and I did and she took a picture, she took a few more picture and next day we went back to Vegas. When we returned to Las Vegas she sent me the picture to my computer and I found out that up in the sky behind me was something. My son zoomed the picture and we saw that it was a Hexagon. He separated the Hexagon from me to zoom it and we saw figures inside it. I will never know what it is, but it is not easy to see shapes like this in the sky, some people think it could be a hologram sent by an space ship, but as I said, I don't know what it is. For a few days I had the strange feeling that this was some kind of sign and then I dismissed it and tried to forget it. Thank you for reading. {pid}"],"Date Submitted":"07/15/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"34.87782","Region":"Arizona","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16546_submitter_file1__2009_04160001.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16546_submitter_file2__Alien_Hexagon2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16546_submitter_file2__Alien_Hexagon2.JPG.1","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16546_submitter_file2__Alien_Hexagon2.JPG.2","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16546.html"],"City":"Sedona","Log Number":"US-04172009-0007","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Sedona","There were no other sightings in Sedona on or around July 15th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-111.75338","Summary":"It was a hexagon.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"16546"}
