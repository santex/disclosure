Triangle","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Benton","There were no other sightings in Benton on or around November 9th 2008"],"divs":["sighting detailsthis report is about unusual stars, blue flashes and objects that i have begun seeing. the latest time is 11\\09\\2008 and prior to that on 10\\24, 10\\25\\08 and 08\\03\\08. my background is highly technical and i have been around aircraft and helicopters all of my life. on 10\\24\\08 at approx 2300 i went outside to retrieve something from my truck and as i returned to the house my attention was caught by a fast flashing star (i thought) above a tree line. i had seen this type of star twice before, once in beebe, arkansas above a dirt racing track while racing was being held and again in galveston , texas shortly before hurricane ike. the two previous sightings of this odd type ���star��� showed no overt movement and i attributed any change in location due to the earth���s rotation. however as i looked at the latest ���star��� object on 10\\24���it wobbled. i immediately thought the wobbling was due to my own head movement, so i pressed my head against the cab of my truck to steady my equilibrium. the ���star��� object still wobbled so i yelled for my girl friend to come outside quickly to verify what i was seeing. she indeed verified the movement i saw. that���s when i ran to get my camcorder. while i was mounting the camera on the tripod my girlfriend shouted that the star went below the tree line.. as i went back outside she stated now it���s coming back up above the tree line had it been a windy night i would attribute the wobbling to be movement of the trees. however, there was absolutely no wind. cool crisp, clear night. zero cloud cover. i taped the ���star��� as best i could and we returned to the project we were working on, with the intention of checking on the ���star��� in a few minutes. which we did and it was gone. the ���star��� flashes quite rapidly, giving off red, blue, green, yellow, white, orange colors in rapid sequence. almost as a beacon to make sure it is seen. the area where it was hovering is a major flyway for commercial aircraft. and, in fact, several aircraft did fly overhead during the sighting. the ���star��� was seen again the next night by my girlfriend and myself. we joked ���there���s our friend again���. it was above an event we were hosting. same atmospheric conditions.. i am curious if other people are noticing these odd ���stars���. by the way, i was able to tape all three ���star��� events.. not the greatest quality but i have them. in addition, on 11\\9\\2008, my girlfriend and i were on our way to dinner at a benton restaurant. my friend was driving. time, approximately 5 pm. three commercial aircraft were in single file in the flyway above benton, arkansas heading southwest. i had binoculars with me and was watching the 3 aircraft, when i noticed a dark object in the direction of the aircraft through the binoculars. we pulled over in a parking lot westbound on i-30 to observe more closely. the object was not visible at all with the naked eye and only with binoculars. the object was at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizon. my friend had more powerful binoculars and was able to see the object also and it appeared to be stationary and hovering. we observed the dark object for a few minutes and then decided to move westward on the i-30 service road to see if we could get closer. after a couple of miles we pulled over again in a vacant parking lot and again observed the object. either the object had moved toward us or it was hovering and we had driven closer to it. it was now at an angle of approximately 75 degrees above the horizon. my friend said she saw a white light on the object. i did not see a light. however she had more powerful binoculars than i. the object was clearer at the second location and appeared to me to be a black triangular shape at altitude unknown. my friend kept repeating that there was a white light on the object. again, only visible with binoculars. while placing my binoculars against a light pole to steady them, the object disappeared. neither of us could find it again. i can say with certainty that object was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter or weather balloon or even a leo satellite. in summation, it appeared to me that the object was quite large but at extreme altitude above the flyway over central arkansas. the rapidity with which it disappeared is puzzling. i am considering calling the little rock national airport to see if their radar had detected an unknown southwest of the airport over benton. i don���t expect a positive response if i do. also, i read recent reports of light flashes, blue green, in the little rock area and also in houston, tex near the beltway 8. on 8\\3, i witnessed a deep blue flash in texas city while sitting on the balcony of my motel. it was quite close and very quick. the flash appeared like a comma lying on its side with the head and tail pointing downward. was alone and the event was so quick i couldn���t have alerted anyone else with me in time to see it. i have always joked that i had never seen a ufo and if i ever did then everyone would start seeing them. let���s hope so."],"Sighting
