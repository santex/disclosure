I was the only one who saw it because my dad was driving, my mom was talking on her phone and my both of my little brothers were asleep. I didn't tell my parents because it was late and my dad was irritated because not to much earlier, about an hour, my brothers got into a fight. I didn't tell my mother because she was talking to someone on her phone all the way home, and when we got home, I had to go to bed because it was pretty late."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Other","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Dome","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/03/2011 10:44 UTC","Longitude":"-86.897158","Region":"Alabama","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.327701,+-86.897158(29367)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29367) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29367.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29367.html"]}
