{"Latitude":"46.476496","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI first saw it when I was driving from the Slivnica Pri Mariboru on the normal road (non high way) towards the city through Hoce going onto the high-way at the first junction. The ball was grey, dull, appeared to be hovering still but i was unable to get a perfect view because i was driving in car the whole time, i was seeing it for 10-15 mins by then i came to the shopping centers o the right of the highway about 4 km from where i first saw it, i was driving on as the angle became impossible because the shere was behind me heavy right side at that point, it did not look like a helicopter at all, it was just a ball, no movements, no idea how long it it was there, it was definitely not a balloon and i've seen them so many times, this was a perfect sphere, also it almost looked like it had gradient from darker gray to lighter gray, maybe because of low sun and some clouds around but it was WELL below the cloud-line. What made me first notice it, it was freaking huge for it's distance, darker and larger than the usual aircraft there and definitely larger than a helicopters that fly every few months around here. I had no other people witnesses, i've told nobody either. I only have memory it happend so long ago and cameras or cellphones with good cameras were not even around much those times."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.476496,+15.654674(40102)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40102) map </A>","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Case Number":"40102","Date of the Event":"09/15/2006 05:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40102.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40102.html"],"Country":"Slovenia","Summary":"Big grey ball hovering about 200-300 meters close to airport","Source":"MUFON","Region":"","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hoče-Slivnica","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/03/2012 10:42 UTC","City":"HoÃÂe-Slivnica","Log Number":"SI-07032012-0010","Longitude":"15.654674"}
