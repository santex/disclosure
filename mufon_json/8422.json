{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at work in downtown Medford, Oregon--Peach St & West Main St. I was standing outside in the early morning just as the sky was becoming light. There were misty little clouds. I looked up to my right and saw a silver colored space ship disappear into the atmosphere. It had to be traveling at a terrific speed because it just shot into nothing. It was my first sighting and I will never forget it.I have never seen anything move that fast."],"Latitude":"42.334875","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8422.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"8422","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.334875,+-122.868785(8422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8422) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-122.868785","City":"Medford","Summary":"silver colored craft -shiny looking-round with mound on top","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"01/19/1999 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"01/19/1999 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Dome","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11212007-0004","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Medford","There were no other sightings in Medford on or around January 19th 1999"],"Region":"Oregon"}
