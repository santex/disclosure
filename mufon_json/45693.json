Appearance was similar to seeing Venus in the daytime sky, except it must have been considerably brighter in magnitude than Venus. I continued walking to the end of the street at the walking-path entrance to the greenbelt park. The sighting and the pictures I took happened at 39.566378N, 104.793906W within about a hundred feet or so of the county line between Arapahoe and Douglas counties. I called my wife to come get me with the car, and to bring the camera and the binoculars. It only took her a few minutes to arrive. Together we watched the object for several minutes. Right at 5:30 pm I took several pictures, zoomed in as much as I could. They show a bright white dot in the blue sky. Through binoculars it appeared the same, as a bright white point of light. We continued to watch the object, while being distracted by our car���s dead battery. (Our battery has been weak, so this was just a coincidence, not something caused by the unknown object, I���m sure.) At 5:33 pm we looked up and the UFO was suddenly no longer there in the sky. There were no clouds in the sky at all. The sun was on the horizon right at 5:30, so the object had to have still been in the sunlight. I could still see sunlight on lower elevation airplanes going by, for some time after the sighting. I took a few more pictures of the location, to get my bearings straight, and then as the sun continued setting and the sky was darkening, I noticed Jupiter much higher in the sky. The appearance was similar, although the sky was already a darker blue. I had not noticed Jupiter earlier when the object was in the sky, even though I had looked all around carefully, which leads me to think the object was likely a significantly brighter magnitude than Jupiter to have been seen in the blue sky. My wife and I both saw the object, and we both saw Jupiter a few minutes later. There is no chance that we mistook Jupiter for the object, as the elevation and azimuth angles were considerably different. Jupiter was much higher in the sky at about 60 degrees elevation, and the object was lower, at about 40 degrees by the hand-over-hand measurement technique. The object was just a little south of due east, about 105 degrees azimuth, whereas Jupiter���s azimuth was further around towards the south. They were not at all anywhere near the same place in the sky. During the 18 minutes we saw the object, it did not appear to move at all. I carefully stopped and stood very still while viewing the object through the branches of a tall tree and could not discern any movement at all. At that point early in the sighting I had figured it must be Jupiter, except that it seemed exceedingly bright in the blue sky for what I would expect of Jupiter. As it turned out later, Jupiter was absolutely ruled out. A few years ago I saw Venus in the daytime, in a clear blue sky. Venus was much dimmer in appearance than the object seen today. Also, it is not possible for Venus to be in this part of the sky, opposite the sun, and a later check showed Venus was actually below the horizon. Mars was in a much different part of the sky too, below the crescent moon much further around to the west. The only theory I have at this point is perhaps the object was a large balloon at high altitude reflecting sunlight. If there were no high altitude winds today, perhaps this could explain it. Surface winds averaged 7 mph today in this area. The only way it could have disappeared so suddenly would be for it to have burst. We had not taken our eyes off of it for more than a minute, so I can confidently say the object either burst, or flew away, within a minute of 5:33 pm. I took pictures with my Konica Minolta Dimage Z5 with 12x optical zoom camera on automatic settings. The camera clock was off, so the pictures are time stamped incorrectly, but I took a picture of a GPS display on our Android phone showing accurate time and location, so all pictures were re-calculated for accurate time. I took several pictures are of the object, then I took a few of our surroundings, and of the crescent moon, also zoomed in fully for a good angular size frame of reference. A few minutes after the object disappeared we noticed Jupiter much higher in the sky, and I took several pictures of it too. I noticed that due to automatic shutter speed, Jupiter was harder to image without streaking a bit. The sky was considerably brighter when I photographed the unknown object, hence the automatic shutter time was shorter and the object showed much less motion in those pictures. I'll include four photos. The first three are zoomed exactly the same...
