It was dusk and from the horizon I noticed a group of lights ascending heading north west. No sound or discernible visual indication, except that I counted 14 of them in a mass group. At first it looked like a squadron of fighters taking off, but did not follow normal operational procedures. The spacing was varied and as they broke in distance from one another they slowly dissappeared in a westerly direction."],"Case Number":"43721","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.297136,+-81.406431(43721)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43721) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Kissimmee","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-11052012-0014","Date Submitted":"11/05/2012 03:55 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Strange lights over the horizon heading ne from south of Downtown Disney","Source":"MUFON"}
