I was out in Pennsylvania, where I used to live. I had just gotten kicked out of a junior high basketball game because I was yelling at the stupid fat kid. I don't even know how he made the team. Anyway I was walking home because my license was revoked for throwing cherry bombs out my widow at pedestrians. So I was walking home and I saw flashing towards me. At first I thought it was the cops so I threw my beer in the bushes. When it got closer I realized it wasn't the police so I dove back into the bushes for my beer. When I came back out I saw a big shiny disc with glowing lights all over it flying in the air. Then I passed out. I just thought I should tell someone because this was pretty awesome."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-76.50441"}
