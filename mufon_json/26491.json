Its motion was not smooth, it seemed to slow down and speed up as it travelled. It also seemed to be travelling i nan arc, bending more East as it went. I watched it and remember thinking that it was below the scattered mid level cloud although in the end it seemed to dissapear behind the clur - or just fade... It was dark with only a slight blue tinge left in the west. I tried to finm it on my mobile phone but couldn't see it through the view finder so not sure if it came out yet."],"Log Number":"GB-11102010-0010","Region":"England","Longitude":"-1.757638","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.799304,+-1.757638(26491)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26491) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/09/2010 05:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United Kingdom","Summary":"Saw a bright white star travelling South East.
