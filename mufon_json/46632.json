I noticed one star-like object in the sky, pulsating with blue, red, and orange light. I assumed it was an airplane. I stared at it for about ten minutes and it did not move at all. It was hovering in place probably a few hundred feet above the Sandia Moutains. The only other explanation was that it could have been some sort of light tower on the mountain, but I know where the towers are and it was far from them. So I have no other explanation that could disprove this object beig a UFO. It last for about 17 minutes, moved slightly lower, than abruptly disappeared. There are many videos on the internet of the same exact thing that I saw. There was also a sighting on March 27th here in Albuquerque that matched my description exactly."],"City":"Albuquerque","Region":"New Mexico","Latitude":"35.116143","Longitude":"-106.605391","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46632.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46632.html"],"Summary":"Flashing/ star-like object hovering over Sandia Mountains, then abruptly disappearing.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
