She at first thought it was the police helicopter but when I looked it did not have a white light. Instead, it appeared to be on fire with a red, orange and yellow glow. We stopped for 5 minutes to watch it as it approached. As it got closer (still a few miles away) we could see that the glow was pulsing those same colors. It made no noise as it moved. It then hovered and began to slowly ascend. As it did so, the object began to slowly fade and then vanished entirely."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/18/2012 01:04 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Wife and I walking dog when noticed object coming towards us from south","Date of the Event":"04/17/2012 07:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.199978","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Case Number":"37561","Longitude":"-110.779427","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-04182012-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.199978,+-110.779427(37561)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37561) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
