Thought it might be campfire so went to investigate. In clearing in the woods was a large disc shaped object emitting orange glow. Totally silent. Boys ran home. Later looked out their bedroom window and saw a 3ft diameter ring of light on the ground. Nothing above shining the light onto the ground, just a glowing ring of light.
