The object quickly changed directions, and moved faster, I knew that it could not be a plane. I observed the object follow this pattern going to the Northeast near the Big Dipper constellation. I watched it approx for 55 seconds, and it was long enough for me, to observe the object in the sky. I know my eyes were not playing tricks on me as I stared at this thing move out into space and get smaller and smaller. Shame I did not have a good video camera with a super zoom lens. Someone over NY, North Jersey, or even Northeast PA should have encountered this light. from my advantage or view - I would say it was close to philadelphia airport or Newark airport. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06292012-0022","Summary":"Bright Light with steady movement into the stars","Case Number":"39926","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Brigantine","There were no other sightings in Brigantine on or around June 16th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"06/16/2012 09:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Brigantine","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Region":"New Jersey"}
