Well we hadn't got a min up the road when again on the left side of the road in the next field along, we all saw hundreds of them, again this time they were not only on the ground and all spread out over this field they were hanging there just above the ground from left of the field to right, about 2 hundred feet across this field, and what I noticed most was that they were like getting into line and making a pillar of spiralling lights going up around maybe 3 to 4 hundred feet into the air, but keeping this shape of a tube or strait line of lights Like something was slowly vacuuming them up a glass tube but not so fast, just like a floating motion Well Sam said john don't stop on the road if a car comes up from behind they might hit you so I keep going don't stop, Well the road didn't have any hard shoulder to stop on and I had a few cars behind me now, but I did slow down to around 20 miles an hour and the cars behind me slowed also, there must have been around 5 or 6 cars behind me but no one seemed to mind that I had slowed my cars speed down ,no one gave me a toot on their horn, they all must have seen it too, it was like Christmas lights out there, they were lighting up the hole field in this orangey red colour I continued watching them in my rear mirror , I asked if everyone is ok and my little girl in the backseat said im scared so we just kept driving I wanted to stop i did have a phonecamera but didnt take any pics as i couldnt stop on the road I did see this and thay were not thai lanterns"],"Country":"United Kingdom","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 154 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around June 21st 2008"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"GB-06272008-0007","Date Submitted":"06/21/2008 11:00 UTC","Summary":"Red orange orbs","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Case Number":"11327","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11327.html"],"Longitude":"-0.148744","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"51.685206","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like"}
