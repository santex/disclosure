I was shopping in a big box store one evening and stopped by a TV display. All the sets were showing the bombardment. I wacthed fasinated. The feed was coming from a camera set up in the dessert at night. I believe it was an unmaned camera. Suddenly an object skimed low across the dessert floor from the lower right corner of the screen to the upper left and disappered into the darkness. I had nothing in view to compare for size but guess about fifteen to twenty feet in diameter. The shape was like an upside down meat-pie dish, flat on top and bottom and circular. Rectangular windows with changing colored lights which seemed to move clock-wise rotation. The windows were evenly spaced around the sides of the craft. This craft was a sharp and well defined picture, silvery metalic and silent. I was amazed at what I was seeing! My thoughts were that it was most likly a man made secret project."]}
