I watch the sky every chance I get. Approximately one week ago, I was star gazing and happened to catch this object make some rather abrupt and jerky movements.I had several other people look at this and we all agree this is most likely a UFO. This object stays in the same area just east of Orion's belt. I am surprised that this object has not been reported. This object appears to have a brilliant white light that changes amplitude and has some red, green, and blue light that appear intermittently. I and others have observed this object every night as it rises and sets. It has remained in this location relative to Orion's belt. Perhaps you can verify this sighting and post an opinion on this event."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/27/2011 10:30 UTC"}
