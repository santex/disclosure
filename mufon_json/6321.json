I let the dog out, got the kids out of bed and dressed, made breakfast and got everyone fed, prepared school snacks, ensured everyone had their teeth and hair brushed and off we went to await the school bus arrival of 6:45am. In other words, I was awake, not dreaming. Luckily our bus stops just 20 feet away from my long driveway so I don���t have far to go in the morning. The bus arrived on cue and I watched the children step in and as I was turning to head back inside, immediately out of the corner of my eye, about 10 feet up above the bus, I saw something flying over it. My initial reaction was a ball was tossed by someone and my body reacted out of protection and I shifted and turned to see who did what. I scanned the neighbor���s yard to see if anyone was standing there since that was the general direction that the object apparently came from. As the kids were getting on the bus, my eyes shifted up and I caught ���the ball��� with my eyes and stared in awe as it glided gently now over the bus and across the street over the other neighbors roof and into the wooded tree line in his back yard. It first appeared as a softball sized object and it was lit up like an ember. My next thought was why would someone be shooting fireworks because as it glided across it became smaller like the size of a tennis ball and slowly dissipated and dematerialized somewhat like what you would see in a 4th of July fireworks display. There was no sound and this was not a firework. I stared at ���the lit ball��� in total disbelief as it disappeared into the tree line. I knew I had witnessed something peculiar and as I walked back up the driveway, I turned around one last time to see if anything else was going on but I saw was nothing. This ���thing��� was traveling at about ��� less the velocity of a tossed ball. In other words it was slow, like a butterfly, so I was able to watch its every move. Now the second phase of my daily routine would entail numerous chores and home management activities and I am typically off and running as soon as the kids get on the bus and I don���t normally slow down until their return in the afternoon. That day was different. I walked back into the house, felt an overwhelming desire to crawl back into bed and that is exactly what I did. In fact I immediately fell into such a deep sleep that I was shocked when I woke up after 11:00 that morning. The only reason I woke up 4 hours later, is that I heard what sounded like two helicopters flying past too close to my house. I really thought my windows would shatter. I got up and was ticked off that these people would have the nerve to fly by so low and especially in a quiet northern Atlanta suburbs near the Polo Fields. It���s an area with many small pastures, some horses and cattle, a couple of schools which means plenty of ���young uns��� and nowhere near any military bases. I looked out the window on their second or third ���fly by��� and noticed there was indeed two helicopters and they were dark colored but now they were too high up above for me to see any details. In the 3 ��� years we have lived in this house there have not been any airplanes or helicopters utilizing this airspace and especially not any flying so low as to rattle my windows. Anyway, as the afternoon progressed I was glad when my husband called to ask if we wanted to go out to dinner. I was still very much lagging behind, feeling exhausted and the thought of schlepping in the kitchen once again was the last thing I wanted to do. We returned near 8:00pm and after giving the kids their baths, I went downstairs to the kitchen to review the next day���s schedule and prepare the kids backpacks for morning. I caught another light out of the corner of my eye and heard what sounded like a tractor behind my house. This seemed odd and since it was dark out. I stepped out back to look past our pool and fence which separated us from another pasture to investigate why anyone would be ���mowing��� this pasture with headlights so late in the evening in the middle of winter. As soon as I scanned the pasture, I saw nothing. No movement, no light, and then suddenly I hear another helicopter in the distance and the darned thing flies towards and above my house at a close enough distance to once again rattle my windows. I stepped back inside annoyed and closed the door. My husband walks in and sees I���m agitated, says he heard it too and I proceeded to tell him they had been flying by earlier that day and they need to quit! Again, nothing else was mentioned. Not that I did not think that I could openly reveal this paranormal experience, it���s just that it really was not in my immediate mind. It���s like the memory had not been erased but somehow it was pushed back into some section in my brain and would not allow me to experience it again. I must have been in shock. Over the course of the next few days as I processed and integrated the events I have now come to the conclusion as I write of my experience a week later that I was in a state of shock. I have since told my husband of my ���lit up flying ball over the school bus��� experience. I know a few things more now of that day, but I am still awaiting the full spectrum of knowledge as to what really happened. After processing this material over the last few days, and still trying to wrap my brain around it, I know now that the lit up ball was really an organic and living and intelligent entity of some kind. I don���t know where it came from and I don���t know what its purpose was. I do know that IT knows that I saw it. That is when it dimmed itself so as to camouflage itself. Yet I could still see it. I don���t know if I was supposed to see it but I did. I think that I was somehow pulsed and told to get back in bed to either forget about my experience or either I got more information downloaded by this organic ���ball��� to me and I will unravel it at some later date. I think the helicopters flying low by my house were indeed either a special kind of military operations getting wind of this ���ball��� or other dimensional beings making themselves appear as military helicopters. I very much want to figure out what their business was with me. I���m pretty sure that neither of my two other neighbors who take their kids to the bus stop would have seen ���the ball��� above the school bus that morning. Since we have big lots between us, they drive in their minivans and wait in their cars for the bus to pull up. I was the only one standing outside with my kids after they were getting on the bus and the other moms views would have been blocked by their automobiles. I���ve noticed that there is reporting today on similar sightings although it is being claimed to be meteors! No way���that would not explain the military helicopters or the fact that the lit up ball I saw just happened to be smart enough to fly just above the school bus and not hit it, or my neighbors house! I think this living ball is what witnesses have previously described during crop circles?"],"Log Number":"US-02052007-0003","Summary":"Flying lit up ball 10 feet over my childrens school bus!","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/25/2007 06:45 UTC","Longitude":"-84.380582","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less"}
