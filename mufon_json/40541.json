{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and son were driving home from vacation on Main Street in Eaton, OH when I noticed a flying object in the air straight in front of us. I got one of feelings that tells you that the object doesn't look familiar and you instantly start feeling like you're witnessing a UFO. Well it made it all more real when the object flew out of sight behind a small group of trees and when we passed the group of trees the object was gone. I thought I was crazy until my wife also started asking where it had gone. I slowed down enough to scan the whole sky and we found nothing. The skies were clear and there was no possible way a airplane could have vanished that quickly after leaving our vision behind a group of trees."],"Summary":"\"Disc Like\" UFO spotted over Eaton, then disappears out of plain sight!","Date of the Event":"07/06/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"39.743922","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.743922,+-84.622762(40541)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40541) map </A>","City":"Eaton","Case Number":"40541","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-07072012-0116","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Eaton","There were no other sightings in Eaton on or around July 6th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"07/07/2012 02:27 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-84.622762","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40541.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40541.html"]}
