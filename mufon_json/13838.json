(the windows at a local restaurant remind me of them, size wise, but i have never measured them.) there were red lights on the bottom-i believe three at the back (but might have been five, one at the front point, and possibly 1-2 more, midway on the craft. one feature that i haven't heard on any of the other reports was a small square tower (approx. 15\") with a small rectangular window at the top of the tower. the tower was at the front point of the triangle. i felt it was a higher look out point. it seemed to be too small for a human. it was about the same height as the craft was from top to bottom. it was dull black in color. not a leaf moved on any of the trees as it hovered, no movement, it was just there. with the windows tinted, we could not see inside. i can't speak for my son, but as i looked at the ufo, i felt that i was also being observed. it was a very eerie and creepy feeling. the hair stood up on the back of my neck and i had goose bumps on my arms. i have always enjoyed reading about unusual things ufo's, ghosts, whatever, so you would have thought that i would have been excited about seeing it, but my son and i were petrified. we were not inclined to pull over until we got to the maryville exit (where we were getting off to see my daughter.) at that time, we tried to see it again from the overpass bridge, but were not able to. my brothers were both pilots f-4 and f-16, so i have been to my share of air shows. i have seen the stealth, etc. etc. it was my distinct impression that this craft had a more advanced technology than we have at this time. i also could not imagine a test plane being tested over a major interstate. if it were technology that a foreign country has, i can't imagine they would risk being seen, and can't imagine what purpose it might have had in that location of mostly restaurants. i did make a sketch of it at the time, but have not located it. i swore my son to secrecy regarding the sighting initially, as i didn't want my daughter to be afraid. then, when we saw the show about ufo's over southern illinois, and started sharing the information. i have heard others say, and it was true for me, that it was hard to quit thinking about it and i would (for example) see a semi truck and think it was about that size. having been interested in ufo's, i have looked out in the night sky, and would not have thought to look in the day light at tree top level! that \"they are here, rather than out there\" was an eye opener for me! my son is a well respected park manager and i am a licensed clinical social worker and work as a dcfs investigator."],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
