{"divs":["Sighting DetailsFirst,I'm Chinese,my English is poor. The story: i was waked up by the noisy of somebody's ring tone outside. it's about 1:40, i saw a lightspot in the sky, i thought it might be a star, quickly i found it was impossible,for it's too light to the bad air in ShangHai. Then i thought it's a plane or satellite,it can't be a plane because it didn't move,i don't know if it's a satellite,so i took it a pic. before i took the pic,i thought it mast be a star or satellite an so on,when i saw the pic,i was confused,i really don't know what's on this pic. i suspected that,although i use the selfshot mode to take the photo,it took 15s to exposure,maybe the wind or something else swayed the camera. when i want to take another photo,the cloud hid the lightspot."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"17544","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Windy","Log Number":"CN-06192009-0004","Date of the Event":"06/19/2009 01:46 UTC","Summary":"UFO in ShangHai.","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Shanghai","Date Submitted":"06/19/2009 01:46 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Longitude":"121.473704","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Shanghai","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Shanghai","There were no other sightings in Shanghai on or around June 19th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.230393,+121.473704(17544)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17544) map </A>","Country":"China","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17544_submitter_file1__IMG_3966.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17544_submitter_file2__IMG_3966.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17544.html"],"Latitude":"31.230393"}
