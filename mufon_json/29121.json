My wife spotted it first and brought my attention to it, it was a really bright clearly round white light dropping down from the direction of the moon deep in space it dropped for quite a distance it seemed like and then it just all of a sudden shot in the opposite direction after that and disappeared. It was an awesome sight. We both looked at each other and I ask her what in the world do you think that was? Her reply was it was not any type of a conventioal aircraft or a shooting star either because it just pulled a sharp left turn and it was gone without even slowing down."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.195943","Log Number":"US-05172011-0007","Longitude":"-114.050276","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Bright light dropping from the moon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29121.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29121.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arizona","Date Submitted":"05/17/2011 09:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around April 15th 2011"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.195943,+-114.050276(29121)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29121) map </A>","Case Number":"29121"}
