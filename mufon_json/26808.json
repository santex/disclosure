(there were high thin clouds but the object was below them) i first thought that it was the headlight of an airplane landing but it seemed much brighter, almost like a welding torch, being that the sun was bright and i had sunglasses on. this light hovered, got even brighter then fizzled out leaving a silver\\grey ball that then faded out in about 2 seconds. i was amazed that that silver\\grey ball was left behind. i have no idea what that could have been. the time is within a minute or two as i was cutting it close with my daughter coming home from school"],"Date of the Event":"10/06/2010 03:56 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Michigan","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/01/2010 02:19 UTC","Latitude":"42.741585","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.741585,+-84.552455(26808)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26808) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26808.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26808.html"],"City":"Lansing","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Lansing","There were no other sightings in Lansing on or around October 6th 2010"],"Longitude":"-84.552455","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
