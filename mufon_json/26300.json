{"Latitude":"33.662167","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsi suspect this can all be explained but last thursday, october 28, at 5:45pm me and my 3yr old son were driving home on pacific coast highway heading north and there was a strange drop-down cloud that had several spirals inside. this drop-down cloud (for lack of a better term) was very bright. to the south of this drop-down cloud was a large round bright circle shining through the clouds. this was strange to me because it was a definitive circle. in one photo there appears to be a greyish orb like thing in the sky next to the bright bright cirle. i did not see this orb like thing until i looked at my photo's. anyway, i thought it was odd enough to take some pictures. thanks [witness name removed cms\\dr]"],"Object Shape":"Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26300.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26300_submitter_file1__IMG00026-20101029-1730.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26300_submitter_file2__IMG00027-20101029-1730.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26300_submitter_file3__IMG00028-20101029-1731.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26300.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Weird drop-down cloud with swirling pattern inside, a large round brightness in a the sky near the drop-down cloud.
