Anyways, I was walking my dogs around the block at dusk. I was headed south with the Moon and Venus to my right. Straight ahead (south) i observed a white light slowly moving NW that i figured to be an airplane. As i neared the end of the street (actually just where the street turns a corner) I saw a faint white halo form around the object. After 2-4 seconds with the halo it suddenly brightened up for a second or less and then disappeared into itself. Best way i can describe is like when you turn off an old tv. The light just shrunk down to nothing vs just suddenly disappearing. I continued my walk, a bit nervous, but I kept watching for it to make a return but that was the end of it."],"Summary":"White orb moving slow thought was plane but faint white halo formed around it, then brightened then disappeared into itself","City":"Lake Kiowa","Date of the Event":"07/10/2013 09:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07112013-0001","Longitude":"-97.006679","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/11/2013 12:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48861.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.566457,+-97.006679(48861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48861) map </A>"}
