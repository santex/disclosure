I videoed 2 UFO sighting in oct 2004 & was on radio (coast to coast am with George Noorey) with Sam Maranto about this in Jan 07. I can't determine if it's some kind of star but it's not acting like one as it is clearer & the flashing is brighter than other visible stars in sky & colors are very visible. I have taken film shots at various camera settings (Manual 35mm camera.) I'm going back out to see if it's still there. I suspect that what I may be seeing is a planet but I can't find a website to confirm it. Please send to me Sam Moranto's current email address & phone number as I would like to contact him again about previous Tinley sightings & A tv show that I would like to produce about the phenomenon.
