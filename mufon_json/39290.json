I glanced up and saw a very bright star-like light. Its size and brightness would be similar to Venus. At first I thought it was a helicopter searchlight. The object seemed to be flying at about the same height a helicopter would and at about the same speed. However, it was close enough that I would have been able to hear a helicopter and most likely see the shape of the body. I could only see the light and there was no sound. The light was bright and -for lack of a better word- twinkling. It was not like a searchlight beam. I watched it for about 15 seconds before I lost track of it behind the trees. The path the object took (from the point I first saw it) was a smooth u-shaped arc coming from and then returning to a northerly path."],"Log Number":"US-06122012-0009","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Case Number":"39290","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Morehead","There were no other sightings in Morehead on or around June 8th 2012"],"Summary":"Very bright star-like light makes a u-turn over my house","Latitude":"38.182293","Longitude":"-83.477334","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.182293,+-83.477334(39290)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39290) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky"}
