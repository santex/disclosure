I had woken up because of some bad dreams. I was smoking and looking at a triangle constellation. I noticed that the security light in the neighbors back yard was turned off which was strange. It had stayed on all night for years. I then saw 3 round lights between the openings in the trees in the neighbor���s back yards. They were mid-sized maple trees and the lights were at the top of the trees. About 30 feet high. Just a little higher than the telephone pole. These lights turned on and off. They did this 3 times. I watched them from 5:15 am to 5:30 am. They were bright enough that they should have illuminate the house but didn���t. They were floating not moving at all. These objects were the size of a car. All three were the same size. About 6 to 7 feet in diameter. They were about half an acre or 100 feet away. The next thing I know is it is about 6:40 AM. I can���t account for the missing time. I���m not sure what happened during the previous hour and 10 minutes. At a quarter to 7 I heard jet engines. The sun was just coming up. I saw 2 air force jets flying close enough I could see the pilots head and shoulders. I was shocked that they didn���t hit the trees because they were so low. They were going slow enough that both pilots looked at me. The jets were blue and silver or some dark color. I���m not sure of the color because I was looking at the pilots. My husband was sleeping when this happened. I should have been afraid but wasn���t. I was confused that I was not afraid. I waited to see if the jets would come back till 7:00 am. She saw movement over by the Leland cypress tree. I saw what looked like a mirage in the shape of an oval. The oval then moved very slowly over head. As the object moved away the morning sunlight hit the bottom of the object and I could see a second oval under the bigger one. It made the metal of the object look like copper. I told my husband that night about what had happened."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Fuquay-Varina","There were no other sightings in Fuquay-Varina on or around November 1st 2011"],"Region":"North Carolina","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35415.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35415.html"],"Case Number":"35415","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.592494,+-78.792663(35415)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35415) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Dome","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-02022012-0012","Summary":"Around 5 AM Saw 3 Lights less then 100 feet Away, about the size of a car.
