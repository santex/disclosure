{"Region":"New Hampshire","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent to the bathroom and noticed a bright pure white light where there has never been one in 16 years living here. I watched it and it sped back and forth and then started to oscillate and dim and brighten. Then it looked like an hour glass shaped light and moved back and forth and up and down in a jumpy motion. This was the event of the 6th and it was north easterly. After about 25 minutes it just totally disappeared. This happen 6 and 7 march 06. the 7th it was in the north westerly and did a simliliar routine but it was at 10:30 pm and moved quite a distance in seconds then stopped and oscillated and jerked up and down and back and forth side to side.
