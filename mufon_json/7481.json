{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis happened in the early afternoon, the weather was dul and cloudy. I was out in a field next to the old shool building walking the dog when I noticed a dark shape out of the corner of my eye just below cloud level. Before I could get a proper look the object darted vertically upward into the clouds making no sound whatsover. At first I thought it was a balloon or something but after a short while it descended out of the cloud again. It hung there for about ten seconds before darting upward again. This repeated four or five times and I managed to get a picture on my phone. After the object dissapeard for the last time I waited 10-15 mins for it to return but it never did."],"Summary":"Dark cigar shaped craft with dark halo dropping in and out of clouds.","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.763201,+-2.70309(7481)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7481) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:05:30","Date Submitted":"07/20/2007 02:01 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Preston","There were no other sightings in Preston on or around July 20th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"07/20/2007 02:01 UTC","Country":"United Kingdom","City":"Preston","Longitude":"-2.70309","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7481.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7481_submitter_file1__Image011.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7481.html"],"Log Number":"GB-07202007-0005","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Cigar","Case Number":"7481","Latitude":"53.763201","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"England","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
