I saw the light moving North, went in the house for a few seconds and when I came out it appeared that it was now moving Southeast. He said it had changed direction suddenly but the speed was the same. Because of that, I continued to look at the sky and in the South I saw a light moving from West to East. It looked like a satellite to me. Within a few seconds, it expanded then contracted to a very tiny light, then disappeared. When it expanded, it did not look like an explosion. The light filled a perfect circle shape. I'm going to guess that it expanded to 5x the size it was originally. I remember thinking when I saw it that I've never seen nor heard of anyone seeing anything like this before and I can't imagine what natural or man-made thing would do that."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"42071","Country":"Canada","Region":"New Brunswick","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-08272012-0020","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bloomfield, NB","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/27/2012 02:36 UTC","Summary":"White light moving East to West.
