{"divs":["Sighting Detailswhile i was out walking my dog tonight,and i say this because i like looking at the stars at night.I noticed a very large very black out line just barely above the trees.while i was trying to figure out what it was this unbelievable bright light lit up,it looked like the sun in the middle of the day,but just above the trees and at 11:00 at night.it made no noise of any kind and just sat there.while looking at this thing i got the feeling that i could not control like i was a fish in a fish bowl with my owner looking in at me and shinning a flash light.the light blinked back out,but i could see that the out line of the thing was still just sitting there.i got kind of scared and went in the house and locked the doors.after i finally got into bed i couldn't sleep,for some reason i looked out my bedroom window and there was this face pressed up against it,but it was not human it was kind of large and defiently a grey color with huge very black eyes.i wanted to believe that it wasn't real so i looked away and when i looked back it was gone.this is not a hoax and i am not crazy,and i don't want to look that way by calling any body.I just don't know what to do if there are little creatures hanging around out side my house. please let me know if there are any more reports of strange things going on in fremont,ohio"],"City":"Fremont","Disposition":"Hoax","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Fremont","There were no other sightings in Fremont on or around September 18th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09192011-0004","Date of the Event":"09/18/2011 11:00 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"02:30:00","Summary":"i saw a face looking into my bedroom window it was greyish with big eyes","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31904.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31904.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date Submitted":"09/19/2011 02:21 UTC","Case Number":"31904","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-83.119433","Latitude":"41.35248","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.35248,+-83.119433(31904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31904) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
