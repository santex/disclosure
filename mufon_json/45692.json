After about a minute 3 of the 5 disappeared and the 4th a minute later. We pulled over and observed the 5th hover for over 3 minutes before it rose into the clouds. I was moving north very slowly and looked like it was rising into the clouds. There was no noise from the source of the lights. I have iPhone video but not sure of the quality of the video until I load it onto my computer."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Fulton","There were no other sightings in Fulton on or around February 12th 2013"],"Region":"Missouri"}
