It started with one but were joined by others. They moved slightly up and down, rather in a box shape but primarily stayed in a small space. When my friend brought a pair of binoculars out to the patio of the condo we were renting we could see the changes to various colores (red, blue, yellow, green) that you could not see without this aid. We are aware of the many militariy bases and fovernment facilities in the area of Sante Fe, but these stayed in one spot for over an hour. At one point I saw a fast white line of white light splash quickly through through the night sky. The next day we left Sante Fe to continue our tour, driving south in New Mexico. I bought several local newspapers but saw nothing regarding what we witnessed. I AM VERY CURIOUS IF OTHERS REPORTED WITNESSING THESE."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-105.027364","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/02/2011 11:45 UTC","Tags":"City"}
