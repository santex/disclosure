It had a disc like shape and the color seemed much different from the planes . It was orange in color and was very bright it moved slowly north to south when it moved behind the house acrossed the street , I than moved to my left ( north ) a few steps and saw it again when just at that moment it shot straight up at a great speed and was gone. It was a very clear night and there was a good number of stars out for a Chicago night. I came in and told my wife and I'm sure she thought I was mistaken. I told a friend of mine the story a day later he than told me the stories that came a week or so later about the O'Hare sightings in early Nov.it seemed very close to my own sighting earlier ."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"6100"}
