this took perhaps 15 seconds. at this point it was about 45 degrees above the southeastern horizon, about mile away, and for 10 seconds or more she viewed the object, first at an angle and then nearly perpendicular as it began its pass directly to our south. she handed the binoculars to me. i watched it for about 10 seconds during which it passed directly perpendicular to my vision, handed the binoculars back and she watched for another 5 seconds before handing them back to me. i had a clear last look with the binoculars for about 3 or 4 seconds. i had the feeling that the object was in some sort of purposeful travel, as if its operators were attending to serious business. both of us were left with an uneasy feeling about what we saw. as it neared we both saw that it was a bright cold-white light in the shape of a globe, perfectly round. it had a smooth surface with a soft incandescent \"reading light bulb\" quality to it. the intensity was that of a car headlight at roughly 150ft, or a powerful hand lantern at half that distance. anyone who happened to be looking would have seen this thing; it was down low, bright, cooking along pretty well, and exceedingly strange. the size was that that of a green pea held at arm's length - or in other words the diameter of a pencil looked at straight on at arm's length. with this apparent size at the viewing range, i estimate the diameter of the light was roughly 15ft. it flew west directly over the top mt. talbert, 3000 feet away to our south, and it was flying level at about 2000ft up. it was traveling somewhat faster than freeway speed, perhaps up to 75mph. traffic on sunnyside road almost directly below it, travels at around 50mph and this object was going faster than that. as it passed directly perpendicular to me, through the binoculars i clearly saw, for about 5 seconds, a surrounding \"globe\" of something like light dust or fog. as if the bright light was centered inside a perfect ball of very faint cold-white fog. this \"halo\" was two or three diameters of the bright center object. when the object and halo moved out of the general perpendicular angle, this halo was no longer apparent. my wife did not see it from her viewing angles. afterwards i checked my binoculars against other point light sources and did not see any such halos or light scattering. with the apparent size and viewing distance, and comparing the size of the halo against the distances between fir trees at the summit, i estimate the diameter of the halo was 30ft to 50ft. right at the end of the sighting, with the binoculars i followed the object as it flew in level flight to the east. at perhaps a half mile from mt talbert the object suddenly turned into an orange globe. and then probably 1 second later it instantly popped off leaving the image of an orange horizontal rectangular bar that itself faded out in perhaps 2 seconds - the bar did not appear to fall or rise, it just hung there and faded away. no horizontal light was apparent in that area of the sky after that orange bar faded out. the horizontal length of the bar seemed to be the same as diameter of the globe. the thickness was maybe one-third the length. it was as if a huge suspended light filament inside a massive incandescent bulb had rapidly cooled off after the power had been cut. we saw no engines or motors, no rotors, no wings, no wheels, no struts or stabilizers, no flashing lights, no projections or dangling things of any type, no flames or exhaust, no evidence of any propulsion source; just an evenly-illuminated unchanging light. we did not hear any sounds from its direction. it did not vary in horizontal\\sideways position during the entire sighting. no snaking in the air, no wiggles, no drifting, no spinning, no bumping along, no surface-like reflections, no balloon-like undulation. this could well be my imagination, but at the instant this thing popped off and went into an orange bar, at that same instant i would swear that i felt a slight shock wave, sharp. given the distance it makes no sense. but there was an instantaneous feeling, sort of like with a fireworks launcher but without the sound, and the pressure wave at a higher frequency and going much faster. in response i let out a \"hoh\" and not just because the sight was incredible. but then again, imagination is a powerful thing, so who knows. two things that might be noteworthy. this object apparently flew nearly over two possibly sensitive sites, certainly at an observational altitude. on the south side of mt. talbert is located camp wythicomb, an active guard base - the object would have been the same distance from the base at it was from us. second, the light first appeared to me at a position over the general area of the precision castparts company. the company is a prime employer here; they manufacture very high quality aerospace parts, they make and use advanced alloys, and boeing is understood to be a major client. boeing is the dod's major supplier of flying craft and related national security technology. now, if this thing was nothing more than an rc flyer made up to look like a ufo, any of the makers reading this are laughing now; i was tricked good as were probably quite a few others who saw it but are too shame-avoidant to report what they know. but if it was a hoax, it was too good to be true - big, very fast, highly controlled, bright as heck: lots of technology and expense in that. my wife and i have no idea what that thing might have been."],"Country":"United States"}
