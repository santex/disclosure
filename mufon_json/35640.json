I noticed it because it was moving very fast and barely clearing the treetops. It made no noise at all also. It moved so swiftly through the sky flying north. As quickly as it was there it was gone, never changing direction. After it passed, I saw the light from the ranger tower on top of the mountain come on. The light was moving as if the controller of the light was severely spooked. I was spooked myself I had chill bumps and couldnt stop shaking."],"Longitude":"-86.899448","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/17/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Flying saucer looking craft flying along the crest of the mountain.","Region":"Alabama","Date Submitted":"02/12/2012 03:35 UTC","Log Number":"US-02122012-0005","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35640.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35640.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.324231,+-86.899448(35640)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35640) map </A>"}
