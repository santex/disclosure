My son said, look, there is a ufo, I looked south, and sure enough, there was one. I hurried and parked the car, and watched it for about 10 minutes, until it disappeared. It was round, flashed lights from the bottom, in a pattern. It seemed to be just above the tree level. It looked like it was drawing power from the powerlines or was drawing water from a lake."],"Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"11/30/1980 07:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.774516","Object Features":"Window(s), Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2411.html"],"City":"Indianapolis","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Log Number":"","Date Submitted":"11/30/1980 07:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around November 30th 1980"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"past siteing","Case Number":"2411","Disposition":"Hoax","Longitude":"-86.154374","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
