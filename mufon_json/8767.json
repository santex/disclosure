I was listening to my iPod while looking up at the sky which was crystal clear blue with no clouds when I noticed a tiny silver round object hovering above. The object was at such a high altitude that it was hard to keep my eye on it. It moved slowly in a south-east direction but would stop and hover completely motionless every so often. I pointed it out to my girlfriend who found it hard to see at first because of the high altitude. She eventually saw it as well. We watched it for a little longer and eventually ignored it as it was hard to track with the naked eye. We are both professionals living and working in Manhattan and really have no reason to fabricate this story."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8767.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8767.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/31/2006 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Silver sphere over lower Manhattan Financial District","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01022008-0002","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
