i mean, i looked around and only saw one real star in the background, but it looked completely stationary, as it should. so as i let a minute pass by, i realized that the light wasn't stayng the same. at moments, it seemed to get brighter, then just a tiny bit more dim. maybe, possibly, a star does this. but after the next few things i realized, i knew that this phenomenom was something that could not be dismissed. remind you, it was late (and it's still late), i wouldn't have gazed for so long if i didn't think it was a cause for alarm. so, there i am, looking at this big, bright star in the sky. as i looked harder (while holding my breath to make sure the object wasn't moving because of me), i noticed one blinking light on the left side. then i saw a brighter blinking light on the right, except when the right side blinking, it looked like a dim, white beam went from right to left straight to where the blinking light was. while i'm noting this in my mind in awe, i realize that it looks like it's hovering from right to left and up and down and so on. it was not completgely still. in fact, it was moving. just not dramtically like the first star-like object i saw in the sky just last year (around this very time). i began to think that maybe this was a news chopper getting an oversight of the atlantic city skyline. but then i began to think, \"how can that be? it's freakin' 4:40am and it stil very dark outside. in fact, it was dark enough that, the object i was looking at looked like the northern star (in comparison). but two answers must be answered and i think i already know the answers to them. first, \"isn't a chopper or plane required to have clear, visible lights blinking in a set sequence? also, isn't it spposed to have distinct colors like blue or red to identify it as an aircraft?\" this helicopter idea had to be ruled out right then and there, because i knew that the one blinking light on the left was far too dim to identify it as plane because i had to really look at this thing to even realize it was blinking. also, the other blinking light on the right was not set to a perfect sequence or timing. it came off and on, but again, much too slow to identify it as some type of human aircraft. the minutes were flying by, and at this point, i wanted to get a pic or vid. but my camera phone's quality was too crappy, and me being a truth freak, i hate watching ufo vids that aren't clear for they still give the reason of a doubt. i watched the hovering object until the night became day, and soon enough, the star-like object could not be seen. 5:20am is when i lost sight. as a note, i'd like to add that the object had several random tiny specks of light blinking all around it, but they were much too small to describe with complete accuracy. there was one moment where i saw a dim, white glow around the bottom of the star-like object. it continued to move up\\down, right\\left while gradually moving up the sky, higher and higher- like the sun, moon, and stars would. but if that was an alien spacecraft, wouldn't it be likely that they would use the glow of white light to fool a human into thinking that what they seeing was the northern star or venus or something easily explained but not proved. also, the gradual movement up the sky tells me that whoever controlled this thing, knew what they were doing and have probably done it for a long time and many times before. this event is described to the best of my knowledge and i want a response with possible conclusions and or clues to what this star-like object was. i am here to help as much as possible. in fact, tomorrow night, i will watch the sky around the same time, and have my video cam ready for quality footage. note: i completely ruled out the ideas of a helicopter, plane, flare, star, planet, comet, meteor, shooting star, satellite, or the international space station. since the object was hovering several centimeters horizontally and vertically (from my point of view) and not stationary or still as a \"real\" star would, i ruled out the possiblity of it being a star or planet. again, it clearly and definitely moved horizontally and vertically in 2-3 centimeter length, but this was from my point of view and it can also be concluded that as far as the object must have been, those centimeters could have easily been many feet in length. now, since the object was not constantly moving in one direction across the sky, it can be concluded that it was neither a satellite, comet, meteor, shooting star, \"space station\", plane, helicopter, or flare. this object was hovering in the air at a very high alititude for over 30 minutes before disappearing with the morning sunlight."],"City":"Atlantic City"}
