I saw a strange dim reddish thing that was traveling at a slow speed , I had no idea what it was I told my daughter(10) to look too, she saw it, (husband never got up to look )we watched this travel N-S, for a few seconds then it did a small zig-zag move then traveled SE at same speed, I am having a tough time describing a shape as I couldn't tell if it were triangular or boomerang, the color was very dim like but you could see it was a reddish tone.It appeared to be very high up , but was fairly large. It was not a plane! this lasted only a minute or two then was gone in the distance. I couldn't keep my eyes off the night sky, I wanted to see it again. I had never seen anything like this before and may not have thought anything(except the color) if it hadn't flew in a zig zag pattern."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07262009-0009","Date Submitted":"07/25/2009 10:29 UTC","Summary":"Reddish shape in sky traveling (approx) N-S flying a straight line then did a quick zig zag then flew SE.","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Massachusetts","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Haverhill","There were no other sightings in Haverhill on or around July 25th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"18317","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"07/25/2009 10:29 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.769535,+-71.07589(18317)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18317) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18317.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18317.html"]}
