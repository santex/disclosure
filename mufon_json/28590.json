I was looking at a star when I saw a light appear right next to the star. It came out of nowhere and started lighting up really bright not moving at all. Then it dimmed down a bit and traveled south slowly. I was going to grab my camera but it was too late. Then I am sorry I didn't because here comes another one out of the same spot. It lights up even brighter than like the one before it dims out a bit and moved south on the same course as the first one. They were both extremely high up, as high as a star. I have seen this very same thing before but the light comes out of nowhere really bright and then dims out and that would be it. I saw this twice this year but never traveling and never two one right after the next."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.956732,+-118.427605(28590)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28590) map </A>","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around April 4th 2011"],"Latitude":"33.956732","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
