When we were talking,something caught my attention. It was a very bright blinding light. My sisterasked me, What are you looking at? I told her to look up in the sky. She saidthat it looks like the sun. I told her that it wasnt. The reason that I saidthat is because it was smaller than the sun but it was big. It was about halfthe size of the sun at a distance. Then, the spacecraft landed approximately 15feet away from us. To tell you the truth, I did actually think that it was aflying object. When I first saw it, I was very excited because it was new to meand I like things that are new. The object was saucer like, it was hooveringback and forth. Then it regained control and landed. I lost sight of it after ittook off."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.750741","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Canastota","There were no other sightings in Canastota on or around June 14th 1983"],"Summary":"I was at home in my backyard.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.079512,+-75.750741(1552)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1552) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome, Other","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Canastota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1552.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1552.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/14/1983 03:25 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/14/1983 03:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00"}
