It was about 1pm. Not in the shape of any known object like a plane or a bird. One was larger than the other and they were moving in a somewhat straight line and in unison. They seemed to change shape slightly as they moved but were still oddly square. Did not look like any bird or plane I have ever seen. I lost sight of them when I made my turn, I was on my way to work. other wise I would have followed them. Very strange, have never looked at anything in the sky before and not had an explanation."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-80.251958","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Wellington","There were no other sightings in Wellington on or around March 7th 2012"],"Summary":"Saw two square like objects moving in unison over south shore blvd.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"36306","Log Number":"US-03072012-0011","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Wellington","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.644224,+-80.251958(36306)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36306) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36306.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36306.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
