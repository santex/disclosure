The object had what appeared to be a flame emitting from the center of it. There were no other lights and I could only make out the shape of the outline due to the shimmering from the center. I was with my boss and his wife on their front driveway, it appeared to be descending as it headed West, possibly due to damage to the craft, hence the fire. We were directly East of the Florida everglades so the object headed into a sparsely populated area."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/18/2011 08:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.367328,+-80.078328(29685)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29685) map </A>","Log Number":"US-06232011-0003","Case Number":"29685","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29685.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29685.html"],"City":"Boca Raton","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
