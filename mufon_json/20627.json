It was about 7:30 pm and I saw a ball of light a little larger than a star fly at a super fast speed. It was right at the top of my windshield, so pretty low and it zigzagged from left to right and then burst out into the atmosphere. I knew it wasn't a falling star because it went from inside our atmosphere out to space. It flew at a tremendous amount of speed. No terrestrial craft I know of could maneuver like that."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Holbrook","There were no other sightings in Holbrook on or around December 4th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/04/2008 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"34.906348","Log Number":"US-11202009-0007","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
