{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy great grandmother was a little girl when she saw the UFO in 1946. It was around 3:00 in the afternoon when she had herd the townspeople yelling and people pointing at some buildings. She was surprised to see a bright white light above a car repair shop. She searched around to see if it was a reflection or someone with a flashlight but couldn't find any explanation for it. What she described as a glowing orb suddenly began to move slowly over some other buildings. It would hover really slow and then dart towards the ground at incredible speeds then return to hovering. She noticed people around her shocked and did't know what it was, some people were waving at it. She said she felt afraid and cautious because she didn't know what it was going to do. After a while she returned home to tell her parents about the amazing white light she saw."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date Submitted":"09/03/2012 01:35 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Egg","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Toledo","There were no other sightings in Toledo on or around June 1st 1946"],"Log Number":"US-09032012-0004","Summary":"My great grandmother was a little girl when she saw the UFO.
