{"Region":"Ohio","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking pictures on and off through the night of the 5 of may. I take pictures and star watch often. While taking pictures of the moon after 1 am i caught a light in my pics that i knew immediately to be something strange. I just held still in excitement and awe and just kept clicking. As quick as i seen it it disappeared on me. The whole thing lasted seconds. I dont think it went away. I think the light it was emitting (red) just stopped. I would be interested to see if maybe it is in the rest of my pics. I havent altered them in any way. I dont want to play with contrast or anything on them till they are properly examined."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Log Number":"US-05072012-0008","Date Submitted":"05/07/2012 12:57 UTC","Longitude":"-81.423879","Date of the Event":"05/06/2012 01:45 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37984.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37984_submitter_file1__DSCN1307.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37984_submitter_file2__DSCN1308.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37984_submitter_file3__DSCN1309.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37984.html"],"Summary":"light around moon then changed direction flew then disappeared","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Tallmadge","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.071535","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Tallmadge","There were 2 other sightings in Tallmadge on or around May 6th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.071535,+-81.423879(37984)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37984) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"37984","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
