I slowed the vehicle and saw two orange orbs in a stacked formation, one on top of the other. They appeared to be hovering. We pulled over next to a warehouse building just off the off ramp and watched as the top orange light flashed then disappeared. The second orb appeared to move further out towards the ocean. It flashed and began to dim then went on and off then flased really bright before finally disappearing altogether. It maintained roughly the same altitude throughout the sighting."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10272013-0027","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"51893","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Two Orange orbs hovering then moved away from beach then flashed and went out","City":"Carpinteria","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Carpinteria","There were no other sightings in Carpinteria on or around October 26th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Region":"California","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"10/26/2013 09:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
