I seen these lights in the sky and at first I thought it was maybe a couple of meteoroid rocks falling in the sky until they started actually going back and forth. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, then I seen one of the lights disappear and then the other, within a few seconds they both reappeared. I had called my boyfriend at 5:50p.m.and told him what I seeing, he didn't believe it. I really thought I was seeing things and when I pulled into the HAT parking lot I seen all these other cars parked and staring into the sky. The objects seem to keep falling down and I had noticed what seemed to be a plane circling around them and then they just pretty much disappeared behind the trees. I really don't know what it was but it kind of freaked me out. I watched the news all night and didn't see any reports about it."],"Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9306","City":"Brea","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval"}
