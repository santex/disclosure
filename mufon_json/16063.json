The color was amber to orange in color. It was on the west side of the valley. It passed my position in the valley and stopped. It was a little hazy out in spots. It was lost out of my view due to the trees in the backyard as it stopped, but I could not find it. As the day before they seem to light up as they move and get dim when they decide to stop and hover for a while. It was about 8:30pm? I stayed out to about 9:30 and didn���t see anything else."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.700713,+-111.99635(16063)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16063) map </A>","Longitude":"-111.99635","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"West Valley City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.700713","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/13/2009 08:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
