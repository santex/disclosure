The shape caught my eye, because when it was moving, it looked like the sun was making different reflections of light from the object like a mirror would in a sky, plus keeping my eyes focused on the object, it seemed to have blueish, blinking lights. I took a couple of photographs of the object with my Canon X-43 digital camera, 10x zoom on max, from the entrance to the Ipiranga station, looking at the object, which was slowly moving about against the clear blue sky. When I entered the station and went to the open air train departure area, I was unable to locate the object again. All in all, I saw the object for about 15 minutes. The three pictures I have attached have been cropped from the original larger ones using Google's Picasa."],"Region":"SÃÂ£o Paulo","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Sao Paulo","There was one other sighting in Sao Paulo on or around July 9th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"-23.541433","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.541433,+-46.629958(30074)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30074) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/09/2011 04:51 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Date of the Event":"07/09/2011 04:00 UTC","Longitude":"-46.629958","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Brazil","Summary":"A moving object made of mirror-like substance with blueish flashing lights over SÃÂ¤o Paulo, Brazil","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"30074"}
