It did not appear to be moving like the planes that were flickering red all around it (we���re near Sky Harbor airport). I headed south walking down Drinkwater Blvd toward Osborn. The object was on my right, due west, the whole time. At various times I would stop to get a better look at it or try to figure out its size or location in the sky relative to a landmark. It was lower than telephone lines and trees lining the street. I continued past Osborn, and then turned onto 74th street toward Earll. The object was still there and had not moved at all that I could tell; it stayed directly to my right until I turned east onto Earll. I kept turning around to look at the object even though it was now behind me. I saw a woman walking her dog partway down Earll and asked her if she saw what I was looking at and what she thought it was. She said she had thought it was a star, but I pointed out that it was rather large and too low. I also told her I saw dark green and red in the middle of the white rays coming off it. She said it was also blinking. I think she meant the whole thing was flickering in a star-like way; the red and green parts did not appear to be blinking at all to me. The woman said she thought it must be a light on the top of a tower, but I didn���t see anything it could be attached to. I told her if that were the case it (the light) would still be there tomorrow. I told her I thought it was following me home. She joked with me that a beam might come out of it at, and then we parted. I continued down Miller, turning south and crossed Thomas, still keeping an eye on it. Walking down past the residential streets coming off of Miller, I could see that the object came below street lights and barely skimmed over the tops of the one-level houses there. I stopped across the street from an alley where I could see that the light was on a level with the top T of the second telephone pole going down the alleyway, which gave me an idea of its position in the sky. If I stepped slightly to the side, it vanished behind the pole, which gave me an idea of its size. I walked on about 20 feet, but then turned back to my point in front of the alley. That was when I noticed that the object was now slightly lower in the sky because it wasn���t being ���framed��� in the same way by the second telephone pole as it had been before. If it were a light on a tower, it would not have the ability to move up and down on a vertical plane. At Coronado High School, the light was lower than the highest parts of the school, but higher than the lower rooftops. I then turned east at the Boys and Girls Club on Murray lane to head for home. At that point, it was around 9:20 or just after and I was unable to keep track of it. I will follow up tomorrow and walk the same route around the same time to see if I see it again. If I do, it���s part of a tower or something; if I don���t, it���s unexplained. I will update MUFON then. Unfortunately, I do not have a camera phone and so I wasn���t able to get a picture of it."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Saw a star-like object, too large and too low to be a star, hanging in the sky.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.450737,+-112.070627(15302)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15302) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/03/2009 08:40 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Phoenix","Latitude":"33.450737","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-112.070627","Case Number":"15302","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 2 other sightings in Phoenix on or around February 3rd 2009"],"Date of the Event":"02/03/2009 08:40 UTC"}
