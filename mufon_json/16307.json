I had prior contact with him when he filed a UFO report with MUFON in 2007. In his e-mail, he stated that at 1740 hours on 3-8-2009, he saw a cigar-shaped object fly in a straight course from east to west over the distant wooded hills. He described the craft as follows: \"It was not the typical fat stogie-like cigar shape, but rather a long silver colored tube with edges rounded in front and back. I could also barely make out two small blotches of red at even distances from the front and back.\" I am attempting further contact with Mr. Krusee for an in-depth interview."],"Latitude":"47.060201","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-123.258451","Country":"United States"}
