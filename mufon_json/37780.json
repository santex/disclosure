I had no idea what it was but it was so different I had to photograph it. It was a square object moving in a Southerly direction at 1 o'clock in my visual field. The object was extremely bright, moving rapidly towards the cone shaped area in the sky. Since I was in traffic I did not have the time to track it further. Later when I looked at the photograph I thought it was so unusual I needed to report it to you."],"Latitude":"33.207837","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37780.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37780_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37780.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/27/2012 02:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.207837,+-79.385177(37780)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37780) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Square, Rectagular","Date of the Event":"04/19/2012 12:30 UTC","Longitude":"-79.385177","Summary":"Extremely bright square object with a straight line trajectory towards circular opening in the sky.","Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"South Carolina","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Augusta","There were no other sightings in Augusta on or around April 19th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
