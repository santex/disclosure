I was outside in the backyard of my home when I saw a small object in the sky, this object was moving in circles, I decided to go inside my home and grabed my camera. I was able to get a shot of this object moving in the sky and going into the clouds. It was a very distant object white in color and looked like a golf ball. I still have the tape. by the time I went inside my home a very good three minutes elapsed since I have to look for it a see if there any tape available and check the camera if there was enough charge in the battery. When I came out the object was still there. I need someone to come over a take a look at this tape since the object is difficult to trace."],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"09/02/2005 03:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/02/2005 03:30 UTC","Latitude":"29.769173","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.769173,+-95.36307(5389)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5389) map </A>","City":"Houston","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-95.36307","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around September 2nd 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5389.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"5389"}
