As we were getting in I looked up and this bright halogen light descended from a high altitude down to 2000ft to 3000 ft at a southerly steep angle and then shot from south to north at a high rate of speed way faster than any military jet I had seen.My one friend seen it drop like I did , my two other friends only caught a glimpse of it. We were just like \"wow that was kool\" and then we didn't give it much thought after that and continued with our business. The next day I call a girlfriend who lived 30 miles to the north. She said she was outside smoking a cigarette when the light shot over her house towards the north. I then told we had seen it too and that I actually saw it drop from the sky and change course."],"Date Submitted":"08/07/2011 01:30 UTC","Longitude":"-80.98739","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/16/2002 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"29.141696","Case Number":"30464","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.141696,+-80.98739(30464)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30464) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Port Orange","Log Number":"US-08072011-0048","Summary":"bright light like a halogen","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Flash","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Port Orange","There were no other sightings in Port Orange on or around June 16th 2002"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:02"}
