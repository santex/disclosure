We studied Ufos ( ..or anyhow we did a statue of an alien..and showed :) ) for a project in unknown cratures, myth-legend stuff.. It was spring and some snowpiles was still to be seen, the sun was shining and the sky was clear. I was playing outside of school, the boys were playing bandy, girls jumping ropes, myself just goofing around. When one of the girls comes rushing to me shoutinng \"LOOK ��������� A UFO!\" Me and my friends beside me look to the sky and we see a Flying Saucer, (just like the ones we were currently studying... Imagine the feeling :) It flies above us, but a little bit to the right.. ;P It shines in silvery white, it may have been pure white, or the sun reflectng.. It SHINED anyhow..No rotation, if i recall, just hovering above our heads silently passing by.. I thought this is the real deal, they were HERE.. It went in a certain direction.. Behind a tall building. We watched it glide and away from us, I ran to the teachers office, telling of the sight. This is my best memory. Confirmation. My friend ������������ ran after it he says, to see if it was still behind the school building... But it wasnt.. Since this day I have been aware of them, but not whom they are... Still waiting.. (This ufo looked just like the saucer in the X-files intro, more shine though. picture included) I have seen one more UFO ( and countless others, but may aswell been, whatever junk you throw up there.. As they moved straight, this the second UFO moved not like any man made thing) Watching out my window i saw what I thought was a Star, but as I realized it wasnt, as it was resting in the big dipper.. And the second I noticed.. It noticed that I noticed.. In an instant, it started spinning like mad around the star \"Dubhe\", and after a few spins, it flew right into Dubhe what it appeared, like in star wars, millenium falcon. Fast. Big as a star it was, so very high up, and mind reading, or PERFECT timing.. Or they have some good eye sight. Im hoping that the 3rd time's the charm ;)"],"Region":"Dalarna County","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23506.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23506_submitter_file1__13758_180343153722_713823722_3142327_809784_n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23506.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=60.08025,+15.00941(23506)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23506) map </A>","Log Number":"SE-05282010-0015","Country":"Kingdom of Sweden","Object Features":"None, Dome","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date of the Event":"04/17/1997 12:00 UTC"}
