{"Summary":"Silver reflective ball followed electrical lines up and over poles with no attachments.","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas going to work one morning and was walking up the sidewalk when I saw a silver reflective ball following the electrical lines - it was like a giant ball bearing, slightly bigger than a basketball, solid, but real shiny. I stood and watched as it traveled, not wavering in any way the distance between it and the wires or the pole that held them. If the pole was in the way after following the wire, it would go up and over keeping the same distance. It was beautiful, odd and I had never seen anything like it before or after. It had no string, it wasn't a balloon, there were no seams that I could see and it traveled really slow. I knew it as a UFO, it had to be because we don't have anything like it. I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore. I wanted to follow it but hadn't been on the job very long. You would not have been able to see it in the sky very well because it was so reflective."],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"09/15/2011 05:16 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Case Number":"31825","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09152011-0009","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"09/15/1980 06:30 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31825.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31825.html"],"Longitude":"-97.091037","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.017602,+-97.091037(31825)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31825) map </A>","Region":"Oklahoma","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":[],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.017602","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
