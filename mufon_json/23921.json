(ok, but why the 'tinkle, tinkle??) i don't expect to ever get a complete answer, but i would like to know of any similar cases. the only one close i know of was in england, famously videoed, but nothing involving collision. please get back to me if you have any light to shed."],"Log Number":"US-06242010-0009","City":"Cleburne","Summary":"Glowing, bouncing, orb.
