There are few modern conveniences, and 95% of the buildings on the entire island (which I was able to bike in a few days) are 19th century or earlier, and many farmsteads. The island had one unique modern convenience, windmills. Sleek, tall, white, and more or less randomly scattered around the island. There have been people on the island for centuries, and there are several Viking sites scattered around as well. Our experience occurred early to mid morning. I cannot recall the exact date and time of the event. There were six people who witnessed the event, including myself, who set out for an extended bike ride around the island. We left the main hub town, where a ferry ports from the mainland, and headed along a rural bike path, near the water (which was never that far away). We ended up making some wrong turn and stopped to consult a map. At this moment one of the members of the group directed our attention, and eyes, to a strange cloud formation maybe a mile away, asking ���what is that?��� The cloud, dark and heavy like a rain cloud, was over a field of wheat or some grain. The cloud was at a normal height and unremarkable size, and was comparable to other clouds we had seen on the island, and presently near it. The cloud itself was not that unusual. What was unusual was a long cylindrical ���tube��� that came down towards the ground. The tube did not taper like a tornado, but was consistent in diameter, like a hose. The weather conditions were fair, maybe a bit windy being a sparsely treed island, but nothing near a storm. It came down quite a ways and appeared near the ground, maybe several hundred feet above-hard to measure. What was strange is that the tube didn���t appear affected by the wind around us, or near the trees on the edges of the field we noticed it above. Also, when the tube began to move, it seemed to have an independent motion and speed than the surrounding environment. It almost looked alive. No one in the group (aged 21 to mid 50���s) had every seen anything like this. The moment was a stand still, we were all dumfounded. As we watched the tube in disbelief it began to ���recoil��� in much the same way a snails eye retracts into the head of the snail, kind of whipping about like a hose, but slower. At this point we took some pictures, as it neared the mass of cloud. In one picture you can clearly see a circle of cloud, this was a ���cross section��� of the tube, as it recoiled and the ���opening��� at the bottom of the tube faced our direction, right before it was engulfed into the cloud. After a period of possibly 3 to 10 minutes (very hard to tell how long) the cloud returned to normal, leaving no signs of unusual activity. There was a range of emotional reactions to the event. The older people felt like not discussing the event, or offering any type of speculation as to what had happened. The younger 20 years olds, myself in this category, were quick to assume some UFO related event. It certainly was an electric sensation, the sensation of seeing something totally new and otherworldly that was undeniable happening in front of you. We never saw any ���ufo��� during this part of the event. Only when I zoomed in to the pictures later that evening did I notice an ���orb��� an only after getting the images onto a computer did I notice the second ���orb���. No one in the village town that we talked to had any similar experiences."],"Summary":"Descending cylinder of cloud later reveals two orbs in photographs.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ærøskøbing","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"9114","Log Number":"DK-01212008-0012","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
