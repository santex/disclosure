I noticed a jet spraying chemtrails as usual over Los Angeles. Facing west, I took a few pictures before and after buying sandwich. The sun was far left in picture, the chemtrail in center. After I got home I noticed an \"orb\" orange color, in one of the series of pictures. I zoomed up. It was very clear that it was large, far away, ,over Los Angeles, around sunset. This was similar to other orbs that have been posted on the chemtrail sites. But mine was real clear! A solid large perfectly round huge orb based on the distance. The pictures before and after were void of the orb. It vanished. I will try and attached pictures.
