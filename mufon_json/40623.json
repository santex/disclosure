But as I got closer it seemed to me that it was flying in an unusual pattern with no apparent direction. It looked like it was a lost bird flying in circles, going round and round until it finally shined very brightly and headed north in the night sky. My three year old was astonished by its beautiful light, and my husband and myself were baffled by the sight. I am very emotionally distraught as I have never believed in these things before. We did take a picture but its so small."],"Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.657521,+-121.382951(40623)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40623) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/09/2012 03:24 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
