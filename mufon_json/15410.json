It was impossible to make out the shape with naked eye but it was clear that this star like object was not supposed to be there so I took my friends camera and zoomed in for this shot. I knew it was something unusual and have still not figured out what it is.Some of my friends have seen the pic but we are not sure what it is so I posted it on that site. The object remained in place for more than 45 minutes and then slowly drifted towards to the right and out of site.While the object was in place I debated with my friend as to what it is and we both agreed that it was not a star and could not be any craft we know of.It is what it is...a U.F.O. That's to the best of my knowledge."],"City":"Toronto","Date of the Event":"11/20/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15410","Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15410.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15410_submitter_file1__UFOtoronto.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15410.html"],"Log Number":"CA-02092009-0008","Latitude":"43.662006","Summary":"Object captured over downtown Toronto.","Date Submitted":"11/20/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around November 20th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Region":"Ontario","Longitude":"-79.382084","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
