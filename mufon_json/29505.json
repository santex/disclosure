It was very close to the ground and looked like it was literally right above State Line road (I live next to College & State Line Road). I was scared and started shaking. I almost went inside to tell my mom and dad, but I kept watching it for some reason. It kept getting closer with a somewhat fast speed for about 30 seconds and then the flashing stopped and it disappeared, I could no longer see it."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:31","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29505.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29505.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Flashing red and white lights, shaped like a plane/boomerang","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.975863,+-94.607631(29505)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29505) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/12/2011 11:31 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/11/2011 11:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Flash","Longitude":"-94.607631","Log Number":"US-06122011-0007","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Leawood","There were no other sightings in Leawood on or around June 11th 2011"]}
