{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 8:45 PM on July 30, 2009, my then 5 year old daughter witnessed a large red rectangular UFO from her bedroom window. She is very observant and noticed it immediately as it came in to view. My daughter quickly sketched the object and described it as a large glowing red rectangle. The object moved quickly from the north, moving south to the horizon, just east of the crescent moon. She said it \"disappeared\" as it moved behind a large tree across the street. The incident happened so quickly that by the time she had alerted me the object was already gone. Though she was only 5 at the time my daughter is precocious and scientifically minded. I asked her if she \"really\" saw it and she said she did--she does not fib to me and knows the difference between reality and a \"fooly\"."],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2010 02:13 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.848452,+-123.233989(24130)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24130) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Oregon","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Latitude":"44.848452","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Monmouth","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24130.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24130.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Monmouth","Case Number":"24130","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-123.233989","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07042010-0013","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/30/2009 08:45 UTC","Summary":"Red rectangular UFO."}
