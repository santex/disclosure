It was either completely white or glowing. It moved very slowly, headed upwards into the atmosphere at an unusual angle and disappeared. It did not follow the curve of the horizon, and was most definitely moving away from the earth. It moved very slowly from my point of view but must have been moving very rapidly, as it seemed to be affected by atmospheric resistance. Every once in a while it would wobble as if air was blowing on it. A commercial airliner passed between it and my position, and it was not as bright as this was. It was obvious that this object was far away in relation. It seemed to be shaped like a sphere or egg. The most unusual thing about it was its trajectory. I am wondering if anyone else saw it or noticed it."],"Latitude":"34.398914","Date Submitted":"06/28/2008 03:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/28/2008 03:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Egg","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11337.html"]}
