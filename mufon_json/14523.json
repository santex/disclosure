Actually my camera saw it because at the moment of shot i didn`t see it with my own eyes.I took this shot with my nokia n95 phone which has decent camera on it. it couldn`t be a bird because birds appear to small and somethimes not at all when i shot them with my phone. Shape of the ufo in my opinion couldn`t be a plane eather because there are no planes of that shape. When I enlarged the photo and adjusted contrast on the image i noticed that it is symmetrical in shape but distorted on one side, I think this is because it was moving it one direction. But i think it`s speed was not so fast because shutter on n95 phones is not so fast. I have found on the internet that people shot ufo-s on cameras that have sensors sensitive to infrared light, i tested my phone camera and it is sensitive to infrared also."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Central Serbia","Summary":"UFO Serbia.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Šabac","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14523.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14523_submitter_file1__06102008183.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14523.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/06/2008 05:10 UTC","Latitude":"44.75423","Tags":"City","City":"ÃÂ abac","Country":"Serbia","Object Shape":"Saturn-like"}
