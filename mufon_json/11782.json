Shortly after arriving at the park, one of my friends pointed to the east and said \"What is that?\" I looked to where he was pointing, and saw a huge (aircraft carrier sized) dark rectangle hovering over the hills behind the park. It had no features that we could see, and it made no noise. It would stay in one position for a while, then slowly drift in one direction, then become stationary again, before drifting in another direction. We watched it until it became too dark to see it anymore. At the time, I knew we were somewhere nearby Vandenberg Air Force Base, but not being familiar with that area, did not realize til some time after the the base was very close. As the object did not do anything that could be seen as hostile, or even come nearer to us, I was mostly curious, and we talked about what it might be. None of us came up with any real explanations."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Lompoc","There were no other sightings in Lompoc on or around May 31st 1996"],"City":"Lompoc","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Dark grey or black","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.64695,+-120.456871(11782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11782) map </A>","Latitude":"34.64695","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-120.456871","Object Features":"None","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-07282008-0002","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"11782"}
