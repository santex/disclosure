This is common because I live in a flight path leading up to the main airport in State College. This time we took notice to a bright \"star\", that was an orb, that looked brighter than Sirius, hovering and flying around in what looked like a small circle. Soon, there was another orb that was directly underneath it. They continued for approximately 30 seconds until they shot up out of no where and started to follow the plane. The further away they got, the more they flashed orange and green. A few minutes afterwards, we were looking up into the sky eager to see something else. As I was turning to go inside I realized another bright star. My eyes hadn't even completely focused on the star before it developed a bright fire ring around it, flew upwards, than shot to the left and flew out of sight."],"Summary":"2 white orbs hovering possibly 3 as well as another comet like ufo","City":"Bellefonte","Date Submitted":"06/07/2012 11:55 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Bellefonte","There were no other sightings in Bellefonte on or around June 7th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.890129","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-77.780745","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.890129,+-77.780745(38963)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38963) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
