I saw a beautiful sunset and decided to take some pictures. I was standing at the gateway entrance of my house when I started taking a few shots. I came inside my home and downloaded the pics to my laptop. I suddenly noticed that in one of my shots it reveals a dark, round shaped object within the clouds and a passanger airliner flying way below it. What's funny is that I originally bought this camera because at night I see many lights in the sky on different nights and I wanted a high power camera to catch them. I wasn't trying to take picture of a ufo but then again this is not the first time this has happen to me. It's like they want me to see them."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval, Triangle","Date Submitted":"06/02/2010 08:34 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around June 2nd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Dark shaped object in clouds.","Latitude":"25.793469","Case Number":"23593","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-80.218569","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23593.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23593_submitter_file1__IMG_0111.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23593.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/02/2010 07:18 UTC"}
