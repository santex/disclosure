{"Region":"Indiana","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out in my backyard swimming in the pool. As I was floating on my back, I noticed a silvery-white object moving through the sky in the North. At first I didn't think much of it, until I noticed that it didn't have wings like a plane, and it was the wrong shape for a helicopter. A helicopter would have been larger in the front, and smaller in the back, but for this object that was the opposite. I watched it for a little while, but then went back to swimming. About five minutes later, I looked up again and there it was on the opposite side of the sky. Again, I began to swim again. Looking once more a few minutes later, it was back in the Northern sky. I watched it until it went behind a large pine tree, but a minute or so later, it was once again in the other part of the sky. I watched it as it circled around towards North again, wondering what it could be. I glanced away this time just for a second or two, and when I looked back, the object had completely vanished. At the rate it was moving, it should have still been visible, with no objects to block it from view, but there was no sign of it."],"Date Submitted":"07/11/2011 06:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/06/2011 04:00 UTC","City":"Wabash","Latitude":"40.805341","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"30125","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Wabash","There were 2 other sightings in Wabash on or around July 6th 2011"],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30125.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30125.html"],"Summary":"White/silver object without wings or tail, making slow circles in the sky","Longitude":"-85.810981","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cylinder","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07112011-0014","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.805341,+-85.810981(30125)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30125) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
