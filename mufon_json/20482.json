Thought it was a star at first until it emerged from a cloud and continued traveling from the West to East. It was brighter than Venus and did not flicker or flash and traveled in a slight arc from West to Northeast. I tracked it overhead for five minutes until it was out of my line of sight. When in my home I told my roomate about what I saw. We were on our porch and I retraced the line of flight and pointed to Venus to gives some reference as to the objects luminescence. While on the porch a low flying double engine plane approached from the South flying low and swooped over our place and headed in the general direction that the object had taken. Oddly enough this plane did not have it's main bright light on."]}
