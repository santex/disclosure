I saw a blueish light flashing in the distance. I assumed it was a radio tower. As I got closer, the light got brighter. I looked over to the east and above the few houses in the area I could see 3 large square or rectangular blue lights(the color of h.I.d. headlights) that flash in a pattern that seemed to Chase its way around whatever they were attached to. I could only see 3 lights but I could see the lights were flashing 360 degrees from the source. I couldn't see what the lights were attached to. I didn't hear any noise and the lights didn't move. They were just hovering. Froze in one spot. I wanted to stop and take a picture but I didn't feel comfortable stopping and there were no other cars around. I watched the lights in my mirrors and after about a mile I seen the lights rise above the trees and disapear."],"Region":"Missouri","Summary":"extreamly bright square/rectangular blue/white lights flashing in a chasing pattern around unknown object at tree tops","Longitude":"-90.463726","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07272012-0014","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States"}
