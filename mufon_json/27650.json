I got up and went into living room. I opened the blinds, and watched the traffic going to the bus parking lot. I looked out to my left; I saw a large bright light which I first thought was a fire but soon realized it was a sphere and moving. The sphere was about quarter size, and extremely bright, [welders torch bright] 35 degrees from horizon. I was looking for my video cam. no luck. I went back to window to track its location & try to decide if stay & take notes or keep looking for camera. I looked for about 5-8 min for cam. I found it. I went outside into parking lot, I could not find UFO in sky. I ran up & down parking lot to get a look to where it went. I finally saw a faint glimmer of white light thru the trees in woods, in 3-5 sec. it was gone."]}
