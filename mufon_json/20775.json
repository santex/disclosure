It was clearly visible against a clear blue sky moving about 150 M.P.H. No observable Propulsion system, no cockpit, no vapor trail, no sound, moving steadily. at the end of the event the center of the object started to disappear and blend with the blue sky. the edges turned a medium gray color and slowly they too faded away and the object completely disappeared. I looked for a good 25 or 30 seconds for any sign but the object was completely gone. It was the most amazing thing I have seen in my whole life.
