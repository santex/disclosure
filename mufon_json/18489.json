I was at the picnic table which is at the northern end of our patio and looked towards the tower. Above said tower, I saw a series of bright lights (5) that looked out of place. I was thinking it was an AirMED helo, or an Army helo, but no sound, not even crickets. It started to move towards the west (GONZALES) and that is when I notice two more behind it. the other two stopped above the tower for a few minutes and then they started to fly towards the west."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"08/03/2009 09:00 UTC","Case Number":"18489","Latitude":"30.242249","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.242249,+-90.911369(18489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18489) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Louisiana","Country":"United States","Summary":"Black Triangle object seen above Laurel Ridge Radio Tower","City":"Gonzales","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Longitude":"-90.911369","Tags":"City"}
