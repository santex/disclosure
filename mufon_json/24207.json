It was not very high, and it made no noises at all. I saw it and the four children that were with us saw it as well and asked what it was. I felt curious and anxious to know what it was. We lost sight of it as it went past the trees. My friend lived on an air base and has seen all of the different jets and helicpters there are and said he never saw a plane or chopper that looked like a fireball."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 02:20 UTC","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.421464,+-90.427017(24207)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24207) map </A>","City":"Galena","Case Number":"24207","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-90.427017","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Galena","There were no other sightings in Galena on or around July 2nd 2010"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
