I was in the passenger seat looking out the window towards the east (ocean). I noticed a black boomerang, oddly shaped object high in the sky not moving. It was completely stationary and up pretty high in the sky (it was definitley NOT a kite). Just when I noticed it NOT moving I noticed a small crop plane flying around it. Probably checking the thing out......Oh if I could find that pilot. I was able to take 3 pictures of it while we were driving, they aren't great, but I did catch it. I lost sight of it because we were driving away from it. My oldest son in the back seat saw it too."],"City":"Melbourne","Date of the Event":"08/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"28.085507","Log Number":"US-07202009-0021","Longitude":"-80.602379","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Melbourne","There were no other sightings in Melbourne on or around August 16th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Summary":"Stationary boomerang object sighted early morning.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Case Number":"18209"}
