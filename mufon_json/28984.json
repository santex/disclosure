The orb was going at speed much faster maybe 50% more than the aircraft in the night sky i was also observing. trying to follow the craft was futile after a couple seconds it was gone as it was much lower than a normal airplane also made no noise. No running light were observed. as i ran to try to follow the craft i lost it in a matter of seconds and all i could see was a few planes to my south following the path ive observed hundreds of times before(west to east). what made me fist notice it was the color how bright it was and the speed, i thought the speed was just because it was so much lower than the average altitude of a passenger jet. I was very surprised when i saw the object and just wanted to observe more until it disappeared."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
