The light stopped and hovered for about 10 seconds and then started to move again quickly further to the South East. Seven minutes later the same light reappeared from the North East and continued to travel much slower to the South East and then disappeared. At first look we thought that the light we saw was a ball of some kind. When the light got into better view I jumped up and took a picture both times. When looking at the pictures after they were taken we saw that the lights were not actually a ball but a round shape and a yellowish white color."],"Case Number":"37675","Longitude":"-111.757749","Date of the Event":"04/22/2012 08:01 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/23/2012 01:32 UTC","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Gilbert","There were no other sightings in Gilbert on or around April 22nd 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Arizona","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Latitude":"33.321941","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04232012-0003"}
