I was looking out the window (with it rolled down) at the store to see if my mother was coming and I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I looked up and there was a triangular shaped... thing... I had no idea what it was!!! It had circular lights that were very, very, bright in each corner of it. It hovered for a moment and then started to move to my right. As it moved, It began to get smaller until it turned into a small orb of bright light. It kept moving to my right and started to flatten. It kept flattening until it was so flat you could barley see it! Then, with a quick move diagonally, it vanished because into thin air. I didn't know what to feel! I kept staring at the sky until my mother came back, turned on the car, and drove away. I told her the whole story but I needed someone else to tell. I thought of you guys because I did a report for elementary school on you guys a long time ago."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44526.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44526.html"],"Region":"Georgia","Country":"United States","Summary":"It hovered over Dollar Tree and then started to move to the right.
