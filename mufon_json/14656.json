the lady was behind me and had already made a left turn on another street so i didn't have time to ask for her help. i choose to get a closer look. i drove forward and when i went down the first hill the object went out of my view because trees raised up in front of it. as i came up the next hill i kept looking left and right but i never seen the object again. i kept looking the rest of the way home incase i misjudged it's distance from me and incase it moved. when i got home i told my wife what i seen and then we drove back to the street where i seen it but it was gone. i few days later i took my digital camera with me to work and on my way home stopped a few places on the street to make pictures of the area the object was hovering above. after enlarging the pictures on my computer i believe i know which trees, building and tall power pole it was hovering above. next my wife and i drove on all the side streets looking for the building and pole. we believe we finally found the area on a dirt road with no name that leads to a power sub-station. i believe the ufo was hovering directly above the sub-station. we drove to the sub-station and then turned around. right next to the sub-station is a mobile home with people living in it. it would have been under the ufo also. i believe the sub-station is only about 1\\4 mile from where i could see the ufo, so it was even closer than that since the street went down and then up a hill. as we drove past the trailer a man came out on the front porch staring at us, but i was afraid to stop because we were probably trespassing on his land and how do you start a conversation with a total stranger about a ufo above his house? the dirt road is a dead end with only one trailer on it and the sub-station. i often wonder if the people living there seen or heard anything. i have lived and worked in this area since 1989 and i have never seen anything that looked like that object in the air or on the ground. some people are probably wondering did i really see it or was i mistaken. well, that would be like asking someone, can you really see that house or can you really see that building in broad daylight with the sun shinning on it. yes, i really seen it. i know ufos exist, but i don't know what they are, where they come from, or what they are doing here. attached is a picture of the area i seen the ufo. the ufo was slightly above the trees with the sky visible under it. it was so wide that the trees on the left side and right side of the street almost blocked some of my view and i guess it was about 2 stories high."],"Date Submitted":"03/24/2008 05:10 UTC"}
