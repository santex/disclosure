Using a digital camera. I was not looking through the viewfinder, but was panning the sky, taking a series of photos in rapid succession. a week later when viewing the pictures this one was the only one with anything other than the Aurora on it. The temperature was -30 degrees fahrenheit, severe clear sky conditions. The Aurora was extremely bright. I did not look in the exact direction of the photos as I was taking them. The sky was so full of Auroral event I was basically just holding the camera over my head and panning it from left to right, and jumped back in my vehicle as it was pretty cold.I have had this photo as my screen saver photo, and everyone seeing it has comments, however they finally convinced me to send it to someone for evaluation. It is not a water drop on the lens or my finger etc. I have no clue what it is. Comments have ranged from an \"ORB\", to a supernova. One of my co-workers who is a retired Air Force radar operator is convinced it is a UFO of some kind.
