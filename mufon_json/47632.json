I noticed an unusual light out of the corner of my eye. I turned to get a better look and still wasn't sure what it was. I got out of my seat and moved to the other side of the porch for a better view. At first, I thought it was a plane. Then I noticed that it was orange and not flashing as planes typically do. I called for my dad to look at it too. He was also confused. A few seconds after he got up, a second light, almost identical to the first appeared just south of the first. However, it was bigger and brighter than the first. The first light suddenly disappeared while the second light followed the same path as the first. After a few seconds, the second light disappeared in approximately the same spot as the first. I have a photo and a video of the event. However, and yes I know this sounds like Bull*hit, my phone is currently not letting me send them to my email..."],"Date Submitted":"05/25/2013 11:18 UTC","Longitude":"-84.153061"}
