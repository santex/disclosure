{"divs":["sighting detailsi am an extremely rational and left brained person. i am currently a strait a student at san diego state university going back to finish a b.s. degree in my late 20's. i would never believe in anything as statistically unlikely as a ufo of alien origins happening upon our little planet, and while i witnessed something that is seemingly unexplainable, i can only assume there is a rational non-alien related explanation. but this experience happened over ten years ago, and i hardly talk about or remember it, recent media coverage of sightings have brought back memories that send chills up and down my body like nothing else can. i was 17 years old and on summer break from high school. this was 1996 and could have happened anytime in the summer between june and august, not exactly sure as i never really documented the details. my highschool sweetheart and i went camping in the higher of the two public campground, i belive paso picacho campground. i have been to this campground many times in the past but never returned, oddly i am thinking about going there in mid may after finals because my interest in camping was jump started by a visit to yosemite last week. anyway it happened sometime between midnight and 2am i assume. my girlfriend and i had to go to the bathroom and got out of the tent and walked over to a tree not too far from the tent. we went on either side of the tree to relieve ourselves and while going to the bathroom i was looking up in the stary sky and noticed a bright white light like the same color but more intense than the color of a star or venus when brightly lit. something seemed out of place. when i finished up i noticed my girlfriend was looking up at the same light as she was finishing up... i asked her if she saw what i was looking at and she said yes. she quickly finished and we stood next to eachother and watched this odd star\\planet like light move through the sky in a slow and un-aircraft like way and grow in size dramatically, i was thinking is this a satelite or a strange experimental aircraft??? then after a short time the slow moving light began to zoom in at us, it seemed like it was coming right for us (right now, writing this, the skin on my whole body is crawling with chills) it became frightening and my girlfriend started to panic because it moved at us from such a seemingly distant location to so very close and just overhead. there was no sound, no logical explanation for the way this light grew and moved to us, but her panic probably jump started panic in myself and we moved quickly to the car, got in and started driving down the campground road to escape whatever was coming at us. we could see out the window that whatever it was was indeed following us (odd thing is i cannot say how large it was or how close it really got, but the perception of closeness and impending danger was extremely real) ... we drove a couple hundered yards before i decided that runing from a light in the sky was crazy and pulled over infront of an inhabited campsite. we got out and immeditely noticed the light had backed off but was somehow still present in the sky... (my memory is a little fuzzy about how the light went from chasing us to backing off)... but nonetheless we sat on a log within 40 feet of some stranger's tents, for safety, and saw the light disapear into the star filled night sky. venus was particularly bright that night and i tried my hardest to rationalize some atmospheric interaction that caused venus to perform such extremely unusual and unnatural movements, but cannot rationally be satisfied with any such explanation. i do not remember if we got any sleep that night but the event was real and had a profound impact on me and my girlfriend at the time. we were both completely sober and witnessed the same thing that caused us to drive for our lives and still gives me chills today anytime i recall the vivid details.... odd thing is that now i reflect on the event some of the temporal aspects of the event seem unclear.. i believe it all happened in 20 minutes or less but upon deeper thought we may have been over an hour. i would really like to know what i saw that night and find relief in the rational explanation even if it is something as far fetched as an alien drone craft sent to remotely sense our natural resources.... the frustrating thing is that i know i will never know the truth."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10507.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10507.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10507.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/15/1996 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Julian","Log Number":"US-04242008-0004","Date of the Event":"06/15/1996 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Julian","There were no other sightings in Julian on or around June 15th 1996"],"Latitude":"33.078655","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"10507","Summary":"Camping in Rancho Cuyamaca State Park, went to bathroom with Gfriend and saw the oddest thing","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.078655,+-116.601964(10507)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10507) map </A>","Longitude":"-116.601964","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unknown"}
