{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI'm usually up and down all night long so I bring out my binoculars and look up at the stars. I noticed what to be a satelite going from between Arcturus the star and Vega. This was going much much slower than any satelite I've ever seen. It took over 10 minutes to go 40 degrees across the sky until it slowly vanished. There is a constellation called the coat hanger that it went by and I counted the seconds at 35 just to go by this little star cluster. I find that the there's a bewitching hour as one would say. Most mornings between the am hours of 3 - 4 am, lights go across the sky. Sometimes they go in groups of 2 or more and sometimes they change directions. Sometimes I see 1, then another 1 will follow it 2 - 3 minutes later. Once I saw what seemed like a very bright meteor. It was way brighter than Vega, looking as bright as Venus. It went from the sw to the ne. I know this isn't a satelite because I looked up where and when 1 would be near me and there should not have been 1 there at that time in the location."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-111.961178","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.416365,+-111.961178(41423)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41423) map </A>","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 2 other sightings in Phoenix on or around August 2nd 2012"],"City":"Phoenix","Case Number":"41423","Log Number":"US-08042012-0022","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.416365","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41423.html"],"Summary":"Observed object flying across sky which took over 10 minutes","Date of the Event":"08/02/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"08/04/2012 02:52 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States"}
