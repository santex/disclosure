( i will make a report of this separately but will include it here as well briefly. my wife left work at 4:30, stopped at a grocery store and then called me at about 4:50 to say i can see it...i just say the thing again! she whitnessed it on hwy 7 far west of the city over countryside just east of the town of st. bonifacious minnesota. it was closer to the tree line this time and she could clearly see that it was an elongated pyramid with the tip down. it had a redish glow on the top, a very shiny metalic reflection in the middel and a possible blueish hue or light on the bottom tip. she clearly watched it as it blinked out of existence. she is a serious scientist, a project manager is a high level position with many years of awareness (due to my interest) but nonbelief in this field. today i have had three almost window rattling loud passes close tot he house by a helicopter but when i look to see the helicopter i can;t see any, this is not an exact assesment since i havn't asked neighbors if they saw it, or if they heard it, i havn't called to check local flight plans of aircraft or medical helicopters but i looked and looked and jsut coun't see anything. all of this has been accompanied by stress and dreams of a scary kind....help i must also say that this is not the first time i have reported something to you. last year or earlier this year, we lived in another local and i reported a late night sighting of lights in the sky- but as stated in my report then..i could probably justify that those were maybe conventional. this was not conventional. i am fascinated by all of this but equally scared to death of it. i do not want this and the fact that my wife has seen it scared me more because it has gone from \"joe's little hobby\" to \"my god maybe this is really real!\" this was sighted yesterday- dec. 21 by wife and i, sighted today by wife closed and i have had three very loud and low helicopter passes over my home with no apparent helicopter in the sky- help."],"Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Date of the Event":"12/21/2008 03:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Edina","There were no other sightings in Edina on or around December 21st 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14494.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14494_submitter_file1__minnesotapyramid2008-12-21r50.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14494.html"],"Summary":"Pyramidal shaped object spotted floating with red and blue lights and metallic reflection.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
