{"Summary":"Three floating objects in triangular formation","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"","Longitude":"-83.028197","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were inside the house and my wife looked out the window and noticed threeobjects flying in a triangular formation. She called me over to the window and,after I watched for a moment, I ran to get the video camera. My wife describesthe objects as shiny, silvery objects that looked dark most of the sightingbecause they were backlit by the sun.We originally were thinking the objects were balloons, but the one thing thatdidnt fit with this theory, was that the objects were in the triangularformation. Balloons dont usually fly in formation.The objects were flying in a southerly somewhat westerly direction.By the time I got the video camera fired up, two of the objects were gone. Mywife said they disappeared after going behind one of our trees. The videotape I shot shows one object. The object presumably went behind the clouds and I lostsight of it.I have contacted the local MUFON group and hope to get more weather detail forthe time of the sighting."],"Latitude":"42.493","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3174.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3174.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"3174","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.493,+-83.028197(3174)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3174) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/17/2004 06:30 UTC","City":"Warren","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Warren","There were no other sightings in Warren on or around July 17th 2004"],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2004 06:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City"}
