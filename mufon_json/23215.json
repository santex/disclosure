The object appeared to be about 2000 ft off the ground, above me at a slight angle. It was close enough for me to see the \"cockpit\". This is what was emitting the light. I could see what appeared to be a normal fighter pilot, looking out his cockpit at me and my dog. The instruments were illuminating him, but you could not see the rest of the aircraft. The aircraft made no sound, moved forward very slowly, almost hovering. After about 20 seconds of the pilot \"looking at me\" , the craft lifted straight up and into the cloud cover at approx. 5000 ft. The craft never made a sound, but the area where the rest of the aircraft would be was \"see-through\" but hazy."],"Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Summary":"Aircraft with light deflection technology","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.023473,+-96.691446(23215)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23215) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23215.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23215.html"],"trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Plano","There were no other sightings in Plano on or around June 10th 2009"],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Plano","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-96.691446","Date Submitted":"05/09/2010 10:38 UTC","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON"}
