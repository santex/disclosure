{"Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"40.06359","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was heading home from work on Rt 16 heading in the direction of Hanover. Just outside of Newark where it became wooded along the highway, I looked to the right and saw a craft hovering right above the trees. At the time I wouldn't have been able to describe it but now that I have studied the subject a little I know that it looked like the type of craft that George Adamski reported seeing (the kind that sceptics say are some type of chicken incubator light). There was a turret like thing on top with round windows around it. There was light coming from the windows and you could see it shining on the lower part of the body. It was absolutely silent. Since I was alone I was afraid to stop but I watched for as long as I could in my rear view mirror and it never moved."],"Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/01/1977 07:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-06252008-0013","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11307_submitter_file2__map.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11307.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Window(s)","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-82.394094","Source":"MUFON","City":"Newark","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Newark","There were no other sightings in Newark on or around March 1st 1977","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"03/01/1977 07:30 UTC","Summary":"Adamski Type Craft Hovering Over the Trees","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.06359,+-82.394094(11307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11307) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Case Number":"11307","Country":"United States"}
