We thought that was strange ,but not within normal bounds... About 10 minutes later another one appered same part of sky ,same direction, but slightly dimmer... We tried to reason out the lights you know? militery flares, lighting,aircraft, satellite, weather , lasers, metorites, ect... We could not find any resonable explaination....!!! A few minutes later my friend was standing in the yard and spotted another light in the northeastern sky. his detription was a more of a orange glow , but with the same pattern.. Facts; 1. lights appeared in western sky.. 2. faded as it moved north. 3. moved in a strait line. 4. 3 sighting in the same night by two people.. 5. no sounds. 6. no electrial outage.. conclusion - Can not explain! Maybe someone out there has seen these lights.. good sky watching"]}
