I had noticed that the sky wasclear and lots of stars were out. About a mile before I got to Sadorus I noticed2 bright stars in the east sky. They seemed really bright. I glanced at themseveral times. Then rolled my window down to get a better look. The one to theright started to move. I looked for flashing lights, thinking it was a plane,but I didnt see any. It started to move faster to the southeast so I called mydaughter at home to tell her to look out the front door to see if she could seeit. The phone rang twice, then she answered it. I told her to hurry, theres areally bright light and its moving. By the time she got to the door it was gone.It was unreal the way it voomed off. At first it was a large bright star. Thenall of a sudden it took off to the southeast and was a pinpoint. Then it wasgone. Only 1 minute probably elapsed from the time I noticed it and to the timeit vanished. I was really excited about this whole thing, ominous, very ominous."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2143.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2143.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/12/2003 06:05 UTC"}
