It spiraled, zig-zagged, went up and down, and pulsated in all sorts of colors. We've been to plane and helecopter shows, and this thing did not move like our aircraft. It is very fluid and graceful. The only thing different about this time is that we pulled out the telescope to get a better look at this object, but were shocked to find that it appeared as nothing more than a bright, colorful dot. The first time we saw this thing we assumed it was about 2 miles away from our position, but through a telescope that could show every detail of our moon it looked like a star or a distant planet. I thought that something was wrong with the telescope, but at the same time we don't really know how big this thing is or if it's as far away as we think, or if it really could be a star or planet. Needless to say, this will be on our minds for a while."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Not Provided","Latitude":"34.690926","Longitude":"-82.947314"}
