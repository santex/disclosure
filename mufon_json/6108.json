{"Date of the Event":"01/04/2007 06:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was about to walk the dog around 6am, and looked out the front door. I looked into the western sky, when I saw something that looked like the shuttle exploding, or the video footage of it. Only this was traveling slow, and was in a straight line acroos the mountains. I remember seeing blue and green for the colors. The must have been about 40 or so lights swirling around this object as it traveled. I can say I have seen nothing of this nature before in the sky. I heard later that it was some kind of RUSSIAN space debris?? Since when does debris travel along the sky and not loose altitude? Anyways I thought I would share that with you. I am suprised the NEWS in Denver didn't report anything on it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6108.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6108.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.653565,+-104.98618(6108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6108) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Longitude":"-104.98618","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"01/04/2007 06:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Englewood","There were no other sightings in Englewood on or around January 4th 2007"],"City":"Englewood","Case Number":"6108","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01082007-0004","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.653565","Summary":"Cigar Shaped object rotating burning lights, traveling south along front range","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
