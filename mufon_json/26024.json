{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and friends were outside looking at the stars and the brightness of the moon. As we were looking at one star this is always bright out of no where two very bright lights appeared close to the one star we were looking at.The two lights were about 500 ft apart but connected to each other. We all starting saying where did those lights come from and they are so bright.Then about 2 mins later they begin to fade on and off and then disappeared.I have experienced many many strange events in the sky over my house. My friends and family have witnessed with me at least 50 or more strange sightings. They all say my house is the hot spot for UFO events.I have videos tapes of several sightings.
