I noticed a light that resembled a planet (as it was brighter than a star) and looked away. I then saw what appeared to be a shooting star that emitted a bright light and I looked up again and saw that the object was moving in a circular pattern. That when I ran inside and grabbed my phone to film it. I followed the object with my camera for about 16 seconds before it completely disappeared in a blink. We are in an area with heavy air traffic all hour of the day so it's not unusual for see several planes in the air at once. This was no plane."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON"}
