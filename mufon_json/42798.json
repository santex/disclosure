Looked to be about the size of a jet or bigger, but hard to judge the distance. Possibly a couple of houses away. Saw it above the trees that surround my property. It was emitting a flashing white light. The light was extremely bright, like a camera flash, but brighter. It hovered in one spot for about 10 minutes. It didn't make a sound. The craft was similar to a sphere, but the top was not perfectly symmetrical with the bottom. The bottom was dark gray, like iron. The top half was a bright silver color on one side and bright red (metallic also). The light emitted from the top of the craft. It was too distant to see the shape of the craft without binoculars, but with binoculars, I saw the shape and color. Suddenly, the craft moved a huge distance in a blink of an eye to high above my house. Then it vanished. It seemed like it just changed direction and went straight up out of view."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/23/2012 09:45 UTC","Longitude":"-85.630571","Log Number":"US-09242012-0022","Summary":"A conical object emitting flashing bright white light changed to spherical craft hovered then shot across the sky and disappeared.","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"Tennessee","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sparta","There were no other sightings in Sparta on or around September 23rd 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Sparta","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.032955,+-85.630571(42798)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42798) map </A>","Case Number":"42798","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/24/2012 07:46 UTC"}
