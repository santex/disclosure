We were heading south down Power Road, stopped at Queen Creek Road to fill a prescription. As we continued south down Power Road an orangish bright fireball came flashing across the sky. It did not look like it was really heading to the ground, but flying level with the ground. It released a smaller round ball of light that seemed to be just 50 or 60 feet off the ground. I did not see the light hit the ground; it seemed to go out before that happened. It was completely silent and lasted about 3-5 seconds. We were looking east toward Picket Post Mountain. I think it may have been about 1 mile away from us. Lightning. No wind, partly cloudy, warm night. I am narrating this to Stacey Wright of Phoenix MUFON and give her my permission to submit this account to the MUFON CMS. I wish to remain anonymous."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown"}
