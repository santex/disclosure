We were looking at Jupiter in our south-east sky. As my husband was repostioning his telescope after our viewing of the planet and I notice a large rectangulr object block out the starfield of the night sky. As I focused my attention, I notice it made no sound, nor did it have any running lights on. After several seconds, I asked my husband to look up from his telescope and acknowledge what I was seeing. He did, and we watched until it left our field of vision. The object was moving in a south east direction. Compared to an airplane the object was large, and it didn't look to be high in our atmosphere. The reason why I hadn't reported the incident sooner was because I wanted to see if we had any satellite trajectories in our area that night."],"Case Number":"18928","Longitude":"-117.563738","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18928.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18928.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/25/2009 10:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"08/25/2009 10:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"large silent rectangular ufo dull in color without running lights","Log Number":"US-08282009-0009","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Corona","There were no other sightings in Corona on or around August 25th 2009"],"Region":"California","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.882454","City":"Corona"}
