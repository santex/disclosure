East of portland airport.Directly in landing path of airport. Look up and see small white sphere moving rather fast(well beyond plane speeds. but not warp speed.) heading north. thought it was kind of curious as I stated. In immediate landing path for pdx. plane was coming in but was still way out. Noticed no marking lights or beacons flashing. Looked away for a second to contemplate. looked back up. continued north for another second then without any deceleration whatsoever made an over 90% turn downward. which didnt make much sense until I thought perhaps a dip in the columbia. I dont know. I do know it was cruisin' along at a nice clip and it didnt seem to turn west. It distinctly looked like an immediate turn towards planet surface. Lost it behind structure I was walking to."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
