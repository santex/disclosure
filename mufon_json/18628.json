It was supposed to be the heaviest night for the showers and thought i may be able to catch a few. I looked to the NE and just above a tree top was a very bright star like object that was flashing red, blue and yellow. at first i thought it may be a jet or helicopter but it was stationary except seemed to be moving VERY slowly to the NE (as in only a few degrees in a 40 minute time period). A few times it seemed to jump up and down but i was staring so hard at the thing that i am not sure if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or not. it was very odd because i've never seen a \"star\" Strobing these colors before. I watched the thing from about 1:50am until about 2:30am and finally just got bored and tired and went in for bed. I work 2nd shift and am usually home around midnight each night. Each night i take the time to scan the skies and this is new to me. It's hard to explain what it was (other than as a strobing star) or if it was anything abnormal but i saw a report on here from chicago with somebody who sounds like they spotted the same thing i did! So it prompted me to report it. Even though i am not sure what it was, it left me feeling very confused...like it just didn't seem like it was something that is usually there or that belonged. i knew it was something different. Still thinking about it as a matter of fact."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.46059,+-85.696406(18628)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18628) map </A>","Longitude":"-85.696406","Case Number":"18628","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Otsego","There were no other sightings in Otsego on or around August 12th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
