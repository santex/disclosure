{"Log Number":"US-08102009-0014","City":"Kokomo","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 9:30 pm our satellite television started to break up it indicated a storm cloud or airplane. I went outside to see,clear night.At that time I saw a bright light through the trees,at first I thought moon but it was too low.I rushed back inside and got my camera and ran to a spot where I could see the field where I saw the light.Running between two out buildings, I was four steps from seeing the field at that time I observed a bright light moving away at great speed toward the west or exactly toward Kokomo IN.It was the most beautiful of colors vivid red inside, blue and white aura outside.unfortunately I didn't get any pictures.the moving light could have been meteor but I have never seen anything like that.The moon rose at over the trees in the east at 11:30 I live 7 miles from Kokomo and this light seemed to go over the city. No noise was apparent any time,The light when I first saw it through the trees was very bright and hard to look at,like a arc light."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/09/2009 09:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.487607,+-86.124923(18588)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18588) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.124923","Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"18588","Summary":"Very bright light through trees got camera ran to view saw bright light go west.","Latitude":"40.487607","Date of the Event":"08/09/2009 09:40 UTC","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18588.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18588.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There were no other sightings in Kokomo on or around August 9th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
