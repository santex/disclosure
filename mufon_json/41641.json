While they was looking at hurricane Irene I noticed something fly in to frame then out very,very fast.I re-wound the video and slowed it down, To my suprise the object comes into view,stops and makes an arking retreat. Then it is seen dissapering behind the solar panels of the Space Station. There is several( smudges or spots) on the camera lens that is visable. The object moves independant of the cameras movement.It is hard to determine the distance between the object and the I.S.S because there is only black of space and cloud cover on the earth in the for ground.I have attempted to make a video of this recording but my only means of doing so is with my cell.I have told several people about this at which they laughed, until I showed them the recording and every one that has seen it said that there is some thing out side the ISS window."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-91.825673","Summary":"Saw the object while watching footage from International Space Station August 2011.","Log Number":"US-08112012-0016","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41641.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41641.html"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"41641","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown"}
