He is a uniformed officer of the law in Iowa City, Iowa. If someone needs to contact him they need to contact me first. The event took place at 117am on April 25th 2008. He was on his usual night patrol in an area he and I and many other patrol often. The spot was at the corner of Scotts Blvd and Muscatine in Iowa City. He was stationary in his car near Goodwill warehouse 3825 and looked up in the sky to see a silent yet inteligent light in the sky moving in unidentified motions. He was able to take pictures which strangely resemle others online. At first I thought he was pranking me until I happened to see the Goodwill warehouse in one of the pictures. I have three pictures attached, and he took 14 total."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Unknown","Case Number":"10591","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Intelligent light formations","Longitude":"-91.530168","Latitude":"41.661128","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04282008-0016","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/25/2008 01:17 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/25/2008 01:17 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Iowa City","There were no other sightings in Iowa City on or around April 25th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Iowa City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10591.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10591_submitter_file1__HPIM0262.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10591_submitter_file2__HPIM0266.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10591_submitter_file3__HPIM0268.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10591.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10591.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Iowa"}
