Al the sudden my friend that was in the back seat said \" i think im looking at a ufo\", then my other friend said \" i've been looking at it for 2 minutes now! what is that?\" i said where? where? where? i wanna see it. i finally seen it as i was swerving all over the road as i was looking for it. It was 3 lights in the shape of a triangle, simply not moving. They were just sitting in the sky. So i decided to race toward it after we were looking at it for about 5 minutes, and as soon as i turned down a road that went towards where the ufo was, it jetted off into the horizon,(after it wasnt moving for about 5 minutes)."],"City":"Canton","Case Number":"23422","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.313004","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan"}
