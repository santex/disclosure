I did not see anything unusual at the time, but I���m near-sighted, so maybe I would not have been able to. After I noticed these images in the photo, I took pictures of birds, and various types of airplanes and jets from a distance. I was trying to reproduce what showed up in the picture. Birds were recognizable and planes came out more spherical, probably due to either the motion of the plane or of my hand. That leads me to believe that whatever it is, was more stationary or slow-moving. It could mean something was on the lens, also. I don���t know. The photos before and after this photo was taken, were taken within the same minute and of different areas in the sky. There were no mysterious objects in those photos. I have limited knowledge of digital cameras and would like to know what could have caused these images. Please write me back with any information or thoughts you may have. The first photo (023.jpg) is the unadulterated original. I will swear on my life to that. The rest were photo-shopped in an attempt to get a better look at the images. What I did to those are as follows: picture023 (3) - Cropped picture023 (6) - Auto levels- (I don���t even know what that is)"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.336324,+-81.654171(11011)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11011) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.336324","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"11011","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Strange images.
