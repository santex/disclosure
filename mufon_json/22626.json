{"Date of the Event":"01/01/2010 10:08 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was looking at Bing maps last night to see if I could find crop circles in England. Over Wiltshire, Bing marker B4003, I noticed something very peculiar. It appears to be a craft de-materializing, or materializing. If you look at the photo, there seems to be an object that flashes then explodes into a flash, then its gone. I thought at first the flash was some kind of object on the ground then i noticed you can see through it and see the field pattern below. I also found a crop circle about 5 miles to the east of the anomoly. i believe it's man made since its not very semetrical. Oh well, might be anything, but I thought maybe someone else should take a look at it. Thanks!
