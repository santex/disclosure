I had been waitressing at the GLendorgal Hotel and stepped out onto the terrace for a break alongside two of my colleagues. I noticed them straight away as soon as I stepped outside as they were very striking and I immediatley knew they were not easily explainable. About 20-30 balls of red light flew overhead travelling at the exact same speed, same distance apart. they were about as high as low flying air craft and made no sound whatsover. They each disappeared into the exact same point in the cloud. I, and my two colleaugues were in awe of the craft and tried to come up with some kind of explanation. I was half thinking of running in to get my camera phone but I mwas mezmerised by them and felt very excited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.99477,+-70.049011(7949)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7949) map </A>","Case Number":"7949","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown"}
