Camera observation reveals two rectangular craft one under the other. Both craft on right side have a face that changes its expression. Left side of craft (person���s view) is bright and portioned by wavy panel. A life form to the right of the panel appears to be piloting craft, is aware of our observation, and has been observed to wave and beam out lighted holograms (faces). The top craft on its top left side has an electronic type of projection that appears as a face hologram. At its neck level, computer like instrument panel has small light that has flickered like robot talking. Observation conforms to Vallee���s Type ��� I (b) (c) classification description. When brighter light is observed, it grows in intensity and size. Has been viewed after 7:30 PM for last 4 days. On 3rd evening witness observed it with me. Craft has communicated with us via the crafts face gestures, pilot emitting hollograms from the craft, and viewing us with light beams from projection at left top of craft. My first reaction was denial, astonishment, and now feeling nervous. Incident has been camera recorded and discussed with responsible others who have encouraged me to discuss and be advised by professional's knowledgeable about this type of incident. Such help from your organization would be appreciated. Please use only the telephone number provided for contacting me. I believe the lights are still there. Observed the light during the day to day."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-73.533424","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10629.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10629_submitter_file1__DSC00957.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10629_submitter_file2__DSC01028.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10629_submitter_file3__DSC01044.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10629.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10629.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"10629","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
