{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi was on my back patio about 9:30 pm cst. just as it was getting dark (could only see a couple of stars at the time) i saw a high altitude (approx. 30 k feet) unblinking white light moving from northwest to the south east (more towards the east). i thought this was strange since it did not blink and it was too early to see a satelite. it flew in a straight line until it eventually was out of sight. about 10 minutes later, i saw what appeared to be the same light coming back from the direction which the previous light disappeared (same altitude). the light again was white and unblinking but now moving from the southeast to the northwest. the light continued to fly to the north of my house and was fliying away from me to the northwest when it started growing brighter. i suddenly felt very excited. for about 5-10 seconds it grew bigger and brighter until it suddenly had a bright blue\\white flash. after the blue\\white flash it quickly dimmed and disappeared. even though the object was very high, this bright flash was quite large and bright (about the size of a nickel held at arms length). since the object was moving away from me i knew it could not be the headlights of an aircraft. it almost appeared as though the light was a slow rotating light on the object or the object itself was rotating. about 10 minutes later i then saw what i think was the same unblinking white light object fly at a high altitude back to the southeast again (this time nothing strange happened)...this is very strange because i usually do not see anything but satelites flying above my house and this was too bright to be a satelite. then, about another 5 minutes later i saw what i think was the same high altitude white unblinking light fly over again. i did not hear any noises coming from the light on any of these fly overs. finally, about 15 minutes after my 4th sighting of this object, it flew by again only this time it was very low (approx. 3000-5000 feet) directly over my house. the light was very white, very bright, and again no blinking and no noise. i was extremely excited by this and fumbled around and took a picture of it with my phone (you can see the white light on the picture but it just looks like a very bright star on the picture). if this would have been a helicopter or a plane i surely would have heard something. this 5th and last sighting of this object lasted about 45 seconds as it slowly flew from the northwest to the sotheast. i have no idea what this white light was...i really hope someone else saw this and will report it."],"City":"Kansas City","Latitude":"39.104546","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.104546,+-94.576027(18307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18307) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/25/2009 09:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/25/2009 09:30 UTC","Summary":"White unblinking light moves silently back and forth across the sky at different altitudes - one time growing large and then bright blue flash while moving away","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Missouri","Longitude":"-94.576027","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around July 25th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-07252009-0022","Case Number":"18307","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18307.html"]}
