It was moving from the northwest to the southeast, moving in approximately a 30 degree arc, at which time it reversed direction in a tight hairpin turn without slowing down. It disappeared when it had returned to the position where we originally saw it. We thought that it was unusual but, at that time, we just kind of shrugged the sighting off. It wasn't until later in my life that I realized that what I had seen could be considered an UFO."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02032011-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.16479,+-81.43549(27630)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27630) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-81.43549","Country":"United States"}
