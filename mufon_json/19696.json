When I first saw it, it was near the moon and proceeded to go between the moon and jupiter. There was no flashing or change of course and it had almost the luminosity of jupiter. The color was very close to that of jupiter as well. I watch the sky often and am very familiar with satellites, planes, etc. and this immediately struck me as something I have never seen before. My wife and child were with me and saw this as well."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19696.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19696.html"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Willits","There were no other sightings in Willits on or around September 27th 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/28/2009 03:16 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Star-like moving south-east","Log Number":"US-09282009-0009","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Case Number":"19696"}
