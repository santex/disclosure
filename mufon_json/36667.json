Not the first time I see this.","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was in Fredericton N.B. I was an art student and attending school. It was lunch break, and I was outside smoking a cigarette not far from school. I often look up to the sky. It was mid-day and I happened to look up. I noticed this bright light, looked exactly like a star but a bit bigger, it was white. It was so high up that it was impossible for it to be a plane. There was absolutly no sound, even if there would have been, was so far you would never here it. However it was not far enough to be a star either. It was moving very slowly in the same direction the whole time, as it moved, it also very slowly kept becoming dimmer and dimmer until finaly you could no longer see it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.962506","Country":"Canada","Case Number":"36667","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New Brunswick","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Fredericton","There were no other sightings in Fredericton on or around May 26th 2011"],"Log Number":"CA-03222012-0009","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"03/22/2012 07:32 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Fredericton"}
