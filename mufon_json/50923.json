Nearly every night we would observe an object low on the horizon, very bright make unbelievable moves. On one occasion we witnessed five of the objects perform a scattering of maneuvers. We have seen it go one direction slowly and then speed off and return to its original position. It normally takes place at about 9:30 to 3 in the morning. It is normally orange in color but has blue and red lights that seem to be spinning as it moves. I saw it again last night at 10 pm. I would guess that the object is between 10 to 14 miles away. It has gone over head of us but was really high at the time."],"Summary":"Bright orange lights making impossible manuevers through August and September","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Cherryfield","There were no other sightings in Cherryfield on or around August 5th 2013"],"Case Number":"50923","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Egg, Fireball, Flash","Date Submitted":"09/20/2013 09:52 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
