We were living in modular tents in a field at the Port au Prince Airport. Sometime during the night, I got up to use the washroom (a port o potty at the end of my row of tents). When I rolled out of my tent I was facing towards the runway. We had guard towers and a concentina barrier facing the runway. Beyond the runway about a Km away was a concrete wall, beyond that a shanty town and then beyond that the mountains. If I was facing left, it would be the same thing but looking towards the bay. When I rolled out of the tent, I noticed a bright dome like light over the shanty town. It was a soft glow and almost looked like a dome encircling an area of about 1km left and right of arc. It lasted for a couple of minutes and then disappeared. Their were several witnesses to the event and the next morning we couldnt really explain it. It wasent a fire or a strobe light or a beacon. Were familiar with explosions and it wasnt that or gunfire. It was quiet too."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"18.539269","Longitude":"-72.336408","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Ouest","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.539269,+-72.336408(13140)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13140) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/10/2004 12:00 UTC","City":"Port-au-Prince","Summary":"Weird sighting over Haiti","Date of the Event":"07/10/2004 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13140.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13140.html"]}
