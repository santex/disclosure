The object was stationary in the southeast sky close to the Wyoming Army National Guard Training Base South Range Area. The object then shot across the sky rite over the town of Guernsey and was now in the west it remained there for a few min. and then it shot toward the northeast near the town of Hartville and It was out of low on the horizon my sight due to the foothils.
