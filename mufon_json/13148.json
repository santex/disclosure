{"divs":["sighting detailslast night on the 20th of october,i witnessed a unidentified flying object and a military jet fighter was chasing it. i live in oxnard,calif. up the coast from los angeles on the way to santa barbara. at about 7:45 pm i stepped outside for a smoke on the front lawn.my house faces to the east on the east side of the city. i looked up into the sky as i am prone to do because i am a sky watcher by nature. i glanced to the north and noticed an object flying from the northwest toward the southeast. from santa barbara\\ventura direction toward l.a. area. it was dark out at this time so i couldn't make out the shape but i could see two lights on the craft.it was traveling at a very high rate of speed. then i noticed that behind it at a short distance was another craft.this one had the typical aircraft lights on and also a strobe avoidance light.it was chasing the front craft. as they passed directly to the east of me,i could distinctly hear the jet engine at full throttle on the rear craft and knew it was a military jet. it didn't seem to be making any progress in catching up to the other craft. as they progressed southward the front craft veered back toward the west and the ocean. this would have been in the vicinity of nas point mugu maybe a little east\\southeast over the santa monica mountain range.the chase plane matched the course. by this time, i am standing in the middle of my street to keep them in sight. i watched as they headed out over the ocean in the direction of the channel islands heading roughly toward catalina island. i then watched the rear plane break off the pursuit and turn sharply northward flying off the coast in the direction of santa barbara.the other craft continued southwest over the ocean until i lost sight of the lights of the craft. i have no idea what i witnessed. i have seen this before when i lived on the gulf coast when dea or the coast guard would chase smugglers but this was different. what ever that military fighter was chasing it could not catch it.not many planes that i know can out run a f-16. but this one did easily."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.206835","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Oxnard","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.206835,+-119.171702(13148)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13148) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/20/2008 07:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"13148","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Oxnard","There were no other sightings in Oxnard on or around October 20th 2008"],"Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13148.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13148.html"],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-119.171702","Date of the Event":"10/20/2008 07:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10212008-0020","Summary":"Military jet chasing unidentified craft."}
