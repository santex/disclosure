I stopped in the middle of the road to get a better look at them and. Saw that there were three of them right above the treetops about 100 feet North of me. They were all pulsating at the same time kind of like railroad crossing lights and I noticed a black triangle that was attached to them that was right above the clouds. It was hovering but not completely still. A car approached me and honked so I moved further down the road and pulled off to take pictures but as I rolled my window down five cars approached me head on and their headlights blinded me. When my vision came back to me I looked up and the triangle and lights were gone. After I felt sick to my stomach and my head seems to feel an unusual amount of pressure."]}
