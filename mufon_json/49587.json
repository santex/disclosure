{"Summary":"observed two lights ,that quickly became chevron shape for few seconds then go out to reform into a semi-circle","Region":"New Jersey","Object Flight Path":"N/A","divs":["Sighting Detailson the night of the 1 of august while riding my bike,I always look up in the night sky for satellites and or planes.At first I thought it was a air force cargo plane that regularly fly from that direction with landing lights on to land at Dover AFB. I observed two orange yellow lights coming towards me at about 20 degrees from horizon. the two lights grew to 6 lighting up sequentially two at a time on either side of the original two, until it was a 6 light chevron. perfectly spaced. It stayed visible for only a few seconds and than went out. I can't remember if they went out in sequence. but in another few seconds they came back on as a semicircle only to go out sequentially from left to right , again they only stayed visible for two to three seconds"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Chevron","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.084531,+-74.829172(49587)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49587) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Middle Township","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"49587","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/07/2013 10:22 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/01/2013 08:46 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.829172","Log Number":"US-08072013-0027","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.084531","City":"Middle Township","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49587.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49587.html"]}
