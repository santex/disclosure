We were outside on his porch when he told me to look up I did and I was shocked. At first they appeared to be balloons at first that was until they started forming square an triangle patterns around a larger red object made up of four red spherical objects that were in a square shape two on one side two on the other. When one flew away and several came from the other side I was convinced that they werent balloons. We lost sight of it when the objects passed behind some trees heading NE out in the direction of the ocean."],"Region":"New Jersey","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
