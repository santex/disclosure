I felt kind of excited about it thinking that I was seeing a meteor at first, but as I watched it I realized that it wasn't like the meteors we were watching last night during the meteor shower. It maintained a steady light for the distance over one of the town-homes, then began to blink steadily as it kept moving from our left to right (Southwest to northeast) it continued blinking until it went out of sight over the tree line. I don't have a video camera and didn't want to hunt for my phone, but now I really wish that I had since I only just found this website while trying to research and figure out what it could have been."],"Object Shape":"Flash, Oval, Star-like","Longitude":"-84.570748","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Georgetown","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","Date of the Event":"07/28/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
