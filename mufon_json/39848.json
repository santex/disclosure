I Looked Up At The Sky When I Saw A Strage Ball Of Orange Light. It Was Moving A A Bit Of A Fast Speed. At First I Thought It Was A Satellite,But There Was One In The Sky And The Light Looked Nothing Like It. Plus The Light Was Too Large, Or Perhaps Close, To Be A Satellite. It Seemed To Be Moving From Southeast To Northwest. I Just Completely Freak Out Because I Had No Clue What I Was Looking At. I Had My Aunt Come Outside Because I Thought I Was Just Imagining It,But She Told Me She Saw It. Eventually The Light Was Too Far For Me To See. Then A Second Light Apeared About 2 Minutes After The First. It Did The Same Thing As The First But Was Red On The Outer Part And Orange In The Middle(The First Was Just Orange). Im Still Not Sure What It Was,But Hopefully I Will Get Some Answers."],"Source":"MUFON"}
