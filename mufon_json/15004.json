It seems to \"bounce\" up and down, and move side to side. This is much brighter than any star. We have video taped it for 45 minutes, and have photos as well. Have not seen it move quickly, but in the 45 minutes of video, it moved out of frame several times. 1st sighting was at aprox 3:00 am 1-14-09 (video shot) 2nd sighting was at 7:00 pm 1-17-09(photo's taken by neighbor) 3rd sighting was at 7:30 pm 1-19-09 My wife first noticed it during a sleepless night, and woke me to see it, and video tape it. She noticed it looking out our bedroom window. It first looked like a very bright star, but it moved up, and down, and has a blinking light. It is out tonight during a snow storm, with NO other stars out. I first tried to rationalize what I was seeing...yet what can hang in the sky and move to and fro...what can shine so bright when all the stars are hiding...what planet can leave and return on other days..."],"Log Number":"US-01192009-0009","City":"Quakertown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"01/19/2009 07:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15004_submitter_file1__LightInSky2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15004.html"],"Case Number":"15004","Summary":"Bright light low in sky.
