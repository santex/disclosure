It was very odd because there was, nor had there been any rain. The sky was very clear with only one small cloud. I snapped a picture and noticed two objects that appeared to be flying in tandem. I thought it was dust so I cleaned the lens and took two more photos. In all three photos, the two objects can be seen flying closer to the cloud in each photo. They are two bright discs of light that flew stright, then appeared to arc up over the cloud if you follow thier trail. Both left a distinct trail. The objects appeared to be very bright balls of light. i then had to pay attnention to the road and lost them."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St Augustine Beach","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40829.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40829_submitter_file1__photog.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40829_submitter_file2__photov.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40829_submitter_file3__photok.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40829.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07152012-0020","Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
