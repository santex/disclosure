Looking up I saw one or perhaps two UFO's. It would move from one side of the sky to the other than seemingly vanish and appear instantly across the other side of the sky. I drew closer attention to the objects when I realized they didn't look like airplanes, and upon closer inspection, were not. Although they appeared to move sideways, they must have been moving back or shrinking as their size and sometimes proportions would change. Once they disappeared for about 15 minutes, I left and drove off. Could someone PLEASE call me back, as I am curious if other saw these crafts."],"City":"Los Angeles","Log Number":"US-10182005-0005","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I saw one or perhaps two UFOs over the Hollywood Hills","Region":"California"}
