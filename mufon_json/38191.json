The day was calm and partly cloudy. Absolutely no wind. Something in the distance - over the building on the hill across the Mon River - reflected the sun's light. I saw a white object seemingly hovering and moving back and forth. It was almost spinning if I remember correctly. I watched, trying to figure out what it was. I thought \"Is that a bag?\" What bag acts like that? A Balloon? But it was just hanging there.. I realized I had my own personal camera, a Nikon D40X, and proceeded to try to get a good picture of it, as far as my lens would allow. The object then started to slowly and steadily rise in a straight line. It did this until I lost sight of it. It periodically reflected light - or emitted its own light - until it just vanished in the blue of the sky. The photos provided have been processed so that colors contrast greater and so that the object in question is clearer than before. The variations in white balance are just that - me messing with my white balance trying to get a good shot of the object."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"38191","Source":"MUFON","Region":"West Virginia"}
