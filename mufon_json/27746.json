Shasta around 3:30 pm and I noticed a strange shape in the sky that seemed to be a very strange looking \"cloud\". At the time, there were NO other clouds in the sky. My wife is so interested in UFO's it seemed only right for me to stop at the upcoming rest area and get pictures of this strange UFO-shaped cloud. It remained in the sky for quite some time and I took a few pictures. There were other people there that saw me taking pictures with my cell phone, they saw what I was looking at and also began taking pictures. I could not help but to feel a strange drain of energy from my body... I became suddenly depressed after the experience. Anyways, I got a few pictures and decided I needed to show them to everyone I could. This was by far one of the strangest experiences I've ever had."],"Date of the Event":"02/03/2011 03:30 UTC","City":"Mt Shasta","Date Submitted":"02/09/2011 07:28 UTC","Longitude":"-122.28537","Latitude":"41.410447","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
