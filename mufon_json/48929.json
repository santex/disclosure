No one was around despite it being a beautiful spring day right after school. From out of the North a small Saturn shaped shiny and dull orb came around the neighbors house and hovered over the edge of the roof 10 feet (3 meters) above me. Lights then formed and started circling around the craft with this message pizza Hut Special 15.99. I was frozen to the spot for about 3minutes and could not leave. Suddenly it literally just disappeared and I felt released to be able to leave. This experience has stayed with me and was the beginning of my research and constant fascination with all things UFO since. I have never to my knowledge ha.had another experience. Years later I visited a psychic who told me my mind was not ready to receive the message at that time, but what it really said was \" be patient, Rick,the time is not yet\""],"Object Features":"Dome, Patterned Surface","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-93.091412","Case Number":"48929","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48929.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48929.html"],"Log Number":"US-07142013-0006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"ufo called me out house left me a message","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Iowa","Date of the Event":"05/09/1980 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/14/2013 01:18 UTC"}
