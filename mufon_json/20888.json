Yea, there's a website, but it's a bunch of you know what. \"Stealth Blimp\" is an oxymoron created by morons working for the U.S. military-industrial complex. \"Stealth\" means \"secret\" or hard to see, and \"Blimp\" means something huge and easy to see. So saying \"stealth blimp\" is like saying \"secret but easy to see.\" Duh. Government black ops units (Men-in-Black, etc.) sometimes post false UFO reports on MUFON in their ongoing smoke and mirrors campaign of disinformation. Bottom line: Gigantic triangular UFOS of extraterrestrial origin are real, and the \"Stealth Blimp\" is a black ops false-flag program, so don't believe reports about the \"stealth blimp\" because it's all limp. It's a limp blimp."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20888.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20888.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.904062","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/05/2009 09:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12052009-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.904062,+-77.032006(20888)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20888) map </A>","Region":"District of Columbia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
