mechanical, engine, animal or insect. at this point the light began to slowly move in straight line paths,stop and hover briefly, never ceasing to pulsate. its general direction was toward the barn, then beyond it, up and over the hillside and treeline at the top. yet it did not move in a seemingly natural manner. instead of moving in a direct pathway, it would slowly move in straight line paths, come to a complete stop, hover a bit,abruptly alter its direction, but continue roughly toward the east, southeast; never ceasing the pulsating light. i stood, transfixed during the entire duration of maybe twenty minutes until it was out of view. quite suddenly it dawned on me that i was standing there, alone and unprotected. so, i dashed the yards back to my vehicle, rolled up the windows, locked the doors, and made the right up mcvicker, traveling at a much too quick pace for the rutted road condition. my house was at the first flat of he hill, on the right, with the only neighbors over three hundred feet away, not visible through the trees separating us. i quickly made the right into my drive, up the hundred or more feet, and opened my door to get out. as i had to retrieve a bag of groceries from the back seat, i needed to turn around. in so doing, there was the light(or a different light but looking and acting the same) directly across the road, hovering in the clearing that was at one time an old saw mill. at this point i became absolutely terrified, and quickly extracted my groceries, made certain my dog and cat came indoors and abruptly ran around the house closing doors and windows, pulling down blinds, tacking up sheets-doing whatever i could to make it as closed to visibility from the outside as i was able. i turned out all lights and went upstairs, gathering my animals with me, heading for the windowless walk-in closet upstairs. there were several windows placed where i could do nothing to cover them. i had a distinct impression that i, once the observer, was now the observed,and that unsettled me to the point of writing a leer about what had happened and placing it somewhere safe, yet out of view. after what seemed hours(yet was less than thirty minutes), i went out to the bed to grab a pillow and blanket, and saw the light traveling in the same manner, up beyond the next tree line, near the top of the hill bordering the mennonite farmhouse beyond. the light was now moving toward the east, and it was far enough away that i felt safe enough to watch as it moved over the hillside, out of view. i did, however spend the rest of the night in the closet, doing my best to sleep. several days later, i contacted a cousin of mine in the eastern part of the state who put me in touch with mufon. i don't recall the name of the gentleman who came to take the report, but do recall he was new and i believe was making his very first field report. i never heard back from them, yet it has since been on my mind"],"Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"40.103351","Longitude":"-78.955265","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"27847","Tags":"City","Summary":"Pulsating ball of light","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.103351,+-78.955265(27847)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27847) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Stoystown","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"02/16/2011 04:10 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/30/1991 01:30 UTC"}
