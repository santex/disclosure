{"City":"New Orleans","Region":"Louisiana","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching WGNO tv morning traffic and weather, ( Hank Allen was reporting)when the camera showing the city came on. There were two objects that came on the screen about a half to three quaters of a mile from the camera. As Hank walked on the screen and talked about the weather , one of the objects disappeared behind him and appeared to go up.The other one other one flew around several buildings. As it flew I could see the sun reflecting off it at times.That one went behind the screen that had the temperature, humidity and pressure.The first one that had gone up shot across the top of the screen at a high rate of speed and disappeared off of the screen. The one that had flown around downtown came out from behind the Temp. screen and shot up at an angle off the screen as if to catch up with the first one. After seeing all of this, I pushed the record button on my DVR and recorded it.I called the station to report it. After leaving a message no one returned my call. I just want to show someone the video and see what they think.My friends saw it and said that it was not birds an airplane or anything that they could explain."],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"2 round flat objects moving around New Orleans reflecting the sun at times","Longitude":"-90.063132","Date of the Event":"03/01/2011 07:26 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/22/2011 11:17 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.958936,+-90.063132(28770)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28770) map </A>","Log Number":"US-04222011-0021","Case Number":"28770","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in New Orleans","There were no other sightings in New Orleans on or around March 1st 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28770.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28770.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Latitude":"29.958936"}
