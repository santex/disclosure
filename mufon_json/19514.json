As I looked up I saw the plane cruising at an altitude of about six miles (30,000 ft}, it was a clear cloudless day and I could see the wings and the vapor trail clearly...then came into view much much lower over the tree line on the same trajectory I saw a silver object that looked like an elongated rural gas tank at about two or three thousand feet in altitude ...just a cylinder moving smoothly ...no wings , no windows,no sound,...it was moving fast but not as fast as the jetliner which I assume at that altitude is around five hundred miles an hour...It was at my best guess twenty feet in diameter and at least one hundred feet in lenth...This was in daylight, not a blimp or anything else I've ever seen. As far as I know , man has'nt made anything that big that can fly that fast without making noise."],"Log Number":"US-09202009-0054","Summary":"sited cylinder shaped object moving over home","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.105805","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.435942,+-86.105805(19514)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19514) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/31/0001 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 09:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder","City":"Talladega","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Talladega","There were no other sightings in Talladega on or around March 29th 0001"],"Latitude":"33.435942","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
