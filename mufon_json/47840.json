Clear. 8:16pm, listening to radio while driving home, turned right from Burnhamthorpe onto Glen. Erin dr (heading NW) When looking up to my rear view mirror, I noticed a round star-like object object (to the left of the rear view mirror). Object appears to be far and high above ground, and is reflecting light from the setting sun (west of the object). Both were very bright. Color cannot be judged due to high reflectivity. The size cannot be judged, but can be covered by 0.4mm diameter circle. 8:19pm, after a slight curve on the same road, and a stop at the red light, light reflected fades. Object disappears from view. Object was stationary in the sky until disappearing.
