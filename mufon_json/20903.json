ain't so.\" ...now, all you need to do is look through the night vison goggles and see for yourself. it was the saturday before october 31st 2007. ed grimsley came to monterey to show me night viewing with third generation night vision goggles. shortly after 8pm we went outside and began checking out the sky with the night vision goggles. after seeing birds, planes, moths, trees, leaves, and getting use to viewing, four fly overs took place in about 10 to 15 minutes. there were three groups of two and one group of four. as they flew they remained in perfect formation distance from one another in close proximatry as though they were in perfect unison with one another. what i saw were craft that resembled a folded 8 1\\2 by 11 piece of paper into a delta paper airplane glider. there was a tail section similar to how you would make the tail on the paper glider just like on an airplane tail. the craft were low enough to make out their description. there were wispy cload formations, but mainly clear sky. it appeared that the craft were visibly under 10,000 feet. we have a 1,000 foot mountain near by. the craft appeared to be enveloped in a wave bubble as there was a distortion field around the craft resembling heat rising. the craft were angled slightly pitched nose down like riding on the crest of a wave. the craft crossed the sky from one horizon to the other in about 6 seconds. they made about 4 to 6 sharp angular cuts in straight line formation. that is to say they traveled in a straight line and abruptly made an angular cut of perhaps 30 degrees then straight on the new trajectory until the next cut. first cutting one way then back the other way as they crossed the horizon in about 6 seconds. i computed their speed at roughly 40,000 miles per hour. the best term to decribe the experience is \"surrealistic\". no noise. ed grimsley was with me and he saw the craft at the same sighting with me. that evening i stayed up all night. i did not see anything more dramatic or low. i did see at least ten addition high flying (100-200 miles) which often did make course changes. that night ed saw a spherical craft low over housing area near us. it was the size of a one bedroom house. i did not see this craft. but ed seamed very shocked when he saw it. it abruptly shot off. ed grimsley and i have gone night viewing about 20 times together. each time people see lights and or craft. it is my belief from what i have seen myself, and my conversations with hundreds of other people, that the skys are full of craft and the government simply lies about it. to what end i don't know. but it has caused me to question things even more than before. ed and i have shown over 500 people in the monterey area that you can see the craft with third generation night vision goggles. ed has been doing this since 1996 with the night vision equipment and i imagine has given thousands of people the oppertunity to view. for more information feel free to contact me directly: bob oliver 831 383-2676 boboliver9@gmail.com www.edgrimsley.com i do the radio show \"the bob oliver show, the quantum leap\" www.krxa540.com mon8pm sat9pm west oast time. 888 579-2540 live i have had four other sightings with the naked eye, maybe more. but, for anyone interested, you definately can see the craft with third generation night vison goggles, every clear night. best viewing time is just after dusk. here is how it works: 1. our eyes do not operated well. we see only a limited spectrum of light. therefore everything above and below that spectrum of light is essentially invisible to us. 2. during the day when it is bright, we squint because our eyes can't handle all the light. 3. in fact it is so bright we cannot see the stars during the day. 4. at night our eyes aren't getting enough light it is hard for us to see thngs. 5. using night vison allows the electronic equipment to sense much more frequencies of light and image those frequencies into a spectrum we can see as a solid colored visible object. 6. so what was invisible is now visible. 7. also illuminated objects stand out brighter in the night vision field, so there are objects we can see with the naked eye at night that are then enhanced with the night vison goggles. other observations include experiences which lead me to believe these craft and or occupants communicate with us intelligently. when they are visually sighted, often people including myself feel a connection and and understanding that there is an awareness of being viewed. even at extreme distances. figure that one out and let me know! call me if you want more information. bob oliver 831 383-2676 it's okay for the public to have my information. thanks!"],"Latitude":"36.602198","Summary":"We see carft every night with thrd generation night vison.
