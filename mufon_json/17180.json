At approximately 7:30pm, I left a retail store, as I was walking to my car, I casually looked up to the sky to a location that was Northwest of my vehicle. (To possibly make this explanation easier, Phoenix Metro area is geographically arranged using a Grid pattern., where all measurements and streets are laid out using North, South, East and West as points of reference.) The object I observe was again, Northwest of my original position. It first came to my attention because of it���s brightness. It was right at dusk and the sky was clear where I first observed it. There were small patches clouds Northeast of the objects location.. This patch of clouds represented the leading edge of an emerging Thunderstorm that was traveling, as a whole, in a Southwesterly direction. This made the object very easy to track because it was especially Bright and it had a very definite Diamond shape. The storm cell was absolutely Black in comparison to the area immediately behind the object. I need to say that there is extensive Aircraft traffic under the command of three FAA controlled airspaces in this area, comprised of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Scottsdale Airport and Deer Valley Airport, as well as, Luke Air force Base, almost directly to the West I���ve lived in metropolitan areas most of my life. In Phoenix for nine years. I���m very familiar with seeing all types of Aircraft by sight,by sight,by movement, by location and by movement of safety equipment used by each, (such as takeoff and landing lights and safety strobes) I did notice about three to five other groups of lights, but I quickly discounted them as conventional aircraft. This object displayed none of those characteristics. It did not move during the approx. twenty minutes of my observation. It was a very bright single light, diamond shaped in it���s configuration. The light did not pulse, It did not vary in it���s brightness, it did not move, I could not hear any type of mechanical or electronic noises. I had my cell phone with me that does have a camera feature. Unfortunately, I could not capture an image, because it���s low pixel capability. I drove further north to see if I could get in a better position to attempt to capture a digital image. During this time I thought several times that I had lost observation of the object. But I quickly realized that it was starting to be covered up by the thunderstorm that was continuing to move in a Southwesterly direction. The Clouds were actually passing in front of the Diamond shaped object . The object itself continued to remain stationary in it���s originally observed location. At one point, I pulled into a restaurant parking lot to make a final attempt at capturing an image with my cell phone. There were three employees of the restaurant taking a��� Smoke break.��� I walked over to them and asked if they could see the object I was tracking. I pointed to it���s position in the sky and asked if they could see it. All three immediately said that they could see the object and describe it���s shape, but could not offer an opinion as to what the object was. I continued North and the object remained Northwest and static in it���s position. Still wanting to capture some kind image, I pulled into another shopping plaza. I went into a Walgreen���s Drug store at the Southeast corner of E. Tatum & E. Thunderbird in Scottsdale and asked for a one use Digital camera. They were $20 for one with a good pixel density. I wanted to warrant the expense so I went back outside to see if I could still see it. Unfortunately, in the interim, it had been completely covered by the storm cell that was continuing to the Southwest. This was approximately 7:50pm I also noticed that the storm had started to show lightning flashes, as it intensified in strength. After giving up the search, I continued traveling North towards my home and the storm started to sprinkle rain, strong enough to have to turn on my car rain wipers to the lowest intermittent setting for about 10 minutes.. I am sorry that I can only offer this as anecdotal evidence without an image to verify this sighting. I do however state that this was a real event that was seen by me on the date and time I have indicated in this report."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/19/2009 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Diamond","City":"Scottsdale","Date Submitted":"05/19/2009 07:30 UTC","Longitude":"-111.917062","Weather Factors":"None, Lightning, Rain, Light","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"17180","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.49815,+-111.917062(17180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17180) map </A>"}
