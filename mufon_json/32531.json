The reeds here are all tall and upright, about 8 feet tall. Saw large (about 50 feet diameter) circular area depressed in reeds, and all stalks are bent at the same height, about 12\" above ground. Mostly laying in the same direction, and bent, not broken. There is another similar smaller round area nearby. About 15 feet diameter. Looks as if something very heavy set down. There are absolutely no water craft of any type on this marsh, ever, It is a sanctuary for birds."]}
