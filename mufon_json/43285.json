Upon turning and heading east all of us immediately noticed a large amount of orange lights in the sky at varying altitudes. Maintaining their height and moving south. There was a airplane close by and we could easily see its flashing lights. None of these lights were flashing and all were the same color. I started counting them and made it to 26 and my wife was able to take a pic with her cell phone. They made almost a constellation like pattern that was almost a Big Dipper type shape. Then they just completely disappeared at once. We first thought it was flares, lanterns, or people parachuting but after observing them and their flight path and the way they maintained their height and color then all disappeared at same time just baffles me."],"Case Number":"43285","Summary":"23-28 orange lights in sky then disappear, constellation like formation","Log Number":"US-10152012-0028","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43285.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43285.html"],"Latitude":"39.519898","Region":"Ohio","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.519898,+-84.388766(43285)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43285) map </A>","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Middletown","There were no other sightings in Middletown on or around October 15th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-84.388766","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
