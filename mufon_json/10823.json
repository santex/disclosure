i managed to sit with my arms over the front seat. there was a really good song on the radio that i was really enjoying, however static made it hard to hear the song...that made me angry but i didn't think it was strange at the time. i remember my sister tugging on me, but i thought she was just trying to get my seat spot...she tugged at me about 3 times, when i finally turned my head and was about to grip her out...tell her she could not have my spot...when to the left of the car was an object...as big as the car...following us! following us very close! my sister asked me what the letters \"u.s.a\" spelled...i told her \"united states of america\". my sister knew her a b c's but not how to read. she said that is what was written on the ufo; she also said there were other letters on it she did not understand or reconize. the ufo was lit up like a rainbow...very bright! however, the sun was shinning in my mother's eyes as she drove home and that is why she did not see the ufo...like the sun was in my eyes until i turned my head. we pleaded with our mother to turn her head but she said she did not want to have a wreck. the ufo had red, green, yellow, orange lights flashing around in a circle...some of the lights did not move...it was lite up like a christmas tree! boggles the mind to think anybody could miss it because it was so bright, but that is what happened to my mother and almost happened to me too! it had three levels to it, with the bottom level the widest and the top level the smallest. it was silver and looked to be made of some kind of metal. there were what looked like landing legs tucked underneath, but could have been anything! the ufo followed us all the way home...about a 20 minute drive. when we got out of the car the ufo hovered over our apartments...no sound...it was perfectly still. we tried again to get our mother to look up but she would not, all she could think about was taking the groceries in before the heat melted the ice cream! my mother yelled at my sister and i to take the groceries in, so we did. we got back in time to see the ufo speed away! in the blink of an eye! gone! when it left my sister and i went behind the apartment buildings to see if we could see it...but it was gone:( when this happened there was nobody to report our story to and my sister and i were very young and didn't think anyone would believe us...especially since my sister saw the letters \"u.s.a.\" on the ufo. for the longest time i believed it was a government secret vehicle and thought the reason it followed us was because the government was using the ufo story as a cover-story for their secret vehicle and needed witnesses. before i saw the ufo i watched a series everyday on cable tv about ufo's. i figured the government had access to that information and knew my family would be ideal witnesses for their ufo cover-up story. however this past year i have been studying the facts and have found that people have been reporting ufo's for hundreds if not thousands of years...long before man could fly! the pictures our ancestors drew hundred(s) of years ago look exactly like what my sister and i saw! when my sister and i saw the ufo people would no believe us...just the mention of ufo's and people would laugh...let alone you telling them you actually saw one. even though people are a lot more open today...not everybody is! my sister still can't tell her husband in fear that he would think her crazy! i tried to bring it up once to my sister's husband and got strange looks, so i didn't say anything more about it...and that was just a few years ago! i believe that when man puts his mind to something he can do it! the 2 things that man wants to do is conquer space and time. but if man wants to go to the other stars in the heavens\\universe he will have to conquer time first. is it possible that the ufo my sister and i saw was from the future? are our descendants from the distant future following us? in later years my sister had come to believe that the ufo had written on it \"u.f.o.\" instead of \"u.s.a.\" i believe the reason she believes this is because she saw the letter 'f' also and when you put them together it spells \"u.s.a.f\"...\"united states air force\" but if it was the us why would the air force use other letters that my sister didn't reconize? where they top secret symbols that only specially trained people would understand...or were the letters or\\and symbols some form of future language? in the bible, book of revelations, it says the chosen will speak a language that no one else will understand. my sister agrees to the statement above, however she does not want her named used. thank you for interest:)"],"Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"06/30/1979 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Light","Date of the Event":"06/30/1979 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Galveston","There were no other sightings in Galveston on or around June 30th 1979"],"Summary":"1978/9 Rainbow lit UFO with 3 stories/levels hovered with us about 30 min.","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Sphere","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.793696","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path"}
