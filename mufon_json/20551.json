why no twinkling? i then noticed that the moving light, not changing speed by much, started to slowly veer toward the southwest. what i mean is that it is possible that the light slowed down slightly as it veered, but not by much. by this time, the moving light was now (if at arms length) maybe a half of a foot to a foot in distance. now that it was changing course so drastically, i was convinced that this was not a satellite. as soon as that first moving light started to veer, i set my eyes back to the other two lights and noticed they were now moving toward the north, at the same speed as the first moving light but in a near-opposite direction. in less than maybe five seconds, the two started to fade from sight. i might say that while the lights during most of this time were pure white, it appeared that the two lights moving together and now fading together started to twinkle slightly and maybe show flashes of blue. since the lights were so small and so faint, it was hard to discern distinct color in such a short amount of time. i tried to find the original moving light, the one that veered toward the southwest, but i could not spot it. i venture to guess that it faded into blackness, as well. i will add that this whole incident took place during a span of maybe 20-30 seconds. it was quick, and mind-boggling given that i could fairly easily assess that these were not stars and not satellites. i will attest that i could judge that the lights were indeed moving because i had the backdrop of a carport, trees and some \"telephone\" wires in the vicinity. it was easy to see that these lights were moving, if you happened to be paying attention. i can also attest that i was sober, that the night was cloudless, that there did not appear to be any flight activity from the afb nearby and that there was nothing other than what i have described above. in no more than maybe five minutes, i called someone who is fast becoming an armchair believer of visitations from those out in space, and he stated that it is very possible that i saw ufo activity. i did a little internet research in the next day. this led me to the mufon page, and i noticed that someone in sahuarita noticed three(?) lights. but those were colored, not white. i don't know that we saw the same thing. naturally, i felt a little stirred, because if no one else saw these lights, i felt validation in the fact that there are some strange things hovering above us. this is further evidence that we are not alone, as campy as that sounds. i sincerely apologize for not only having provided some approximations in my observations, but i do not have the kind of technology to have captured any of this for the record. no images. but then, i doubt that i would have caught any because i normally wouldn't carry a camera or otherwise. thank you for this opportunity to get my report out there."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11162009-0018","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
