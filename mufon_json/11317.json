{"City":"New York","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York","Summary":"I saw a UFO over east River from Williamsburg being tracked by helicopters","divs":["sighting detailson the night of the 16th, june, i was over my girlfriends house. she lives in east williamsburg, border with bushwick. it was her last night over and her subletter came so we took her to the roof of the apartment, to show her a perk to the place. while there a bright light, like headlights from an oncoming jet, was shining in our direction. all three of us looked at it in curiousity. the light was slowly sinking and eventually it blinked out. 5 minutes later i looked back in the direction the first light came from, and saw it again. the light seemed to me like it was over the east river, adjacent to the empire state building meaning 34th street. i watched the second object, noticing that it was again slowly sinking, only suddenly without realize it'd restart again at it's top point (i could not notice this as it happened rather instantly). i then scanned the skies thinking perhaps there are more of these ufo's around. what i noticed instead were about half a dozen helicopters, all seeming to converge in the vacinity of the single object that originally caught my attention. the object it self, as i said, looked like the headlights of an oncoming jet. as the helicopters drew near, all but one of them turned about. the one that remained began to do circles around the object. i was astonished, and ultra curious as to what was going on. on it's third or fourth pass around the light source there was a laser, or some sort of flash, coming from the original light source onto the circling helicopter. the helicopter flashed and then began to flicker, motionless in the sky. my girlfriend thought the helicopter was on fire with the way it was flickering. as the helicopter never fell and crashed i assumed it was attempting some sort of light communication with the light source. after about 10 minutes of the flickering helicoptor the original light source seemed to expand in size and then break apart into three smaller light sources. all three were equal size to the original one. soon after this display all the lights blipped out, except for the flickering helicopter. the flickering on the helicopter continued for a few minutes while i observed the other 5 helicopters return to the location. once all together the flickering stopped and the 6 copters seemed to scower the area looking for something they had lost, and eventually my girlfriend lost interest and asked me to come inside. i oblidged. before coming in i scowered the sky one last time, and noticed a similar light far south over what seemed to be coney island, or manhattan beach. i didn't stick around to watch it however. any other reports of a similar sighting around the same time\\area? i'd like to point out, as this mufon report is a couple weeks after the sighting, that the times i gave with this report are not very accurate. i do believe it was around 1:30-2:30am. below was my ats report, which will follow with a link to the thread. \"last night i saw something in the sky that i couldn't identify, thusly i believe it to be a ufo. i was at my girlfriends house in bushwick, hanging out on her roof when suddenly my attention turned towards the city where i saw half a dozen helicopters, all seeming to converge in a single direction. i correlated the direction they were flying too but saw nothing. i began pacing back and forth and then boom i saw some very bright yellow\\orange light hovering, almost gliding over the east river around 34th street. this light was very uniformed and slowly sinking until eventually it blipped out. in it's place a second light appeared, brighter and bigger, swaying ever so slightly left and right. the helicopters came close to the light source, and suddenly all but one turned around. the one remaining moved ever closer. after doing a 360 around the light source it erupted in flickering light. my girlfriend said it was on fire, but the helicopter looked more like it was putting on a light show, perhaps trying to communicate with the light source with patterns of light. after about 10 minutes the light source the helicopters were converging onto expanded in size, looked to me like it split into three light sources, and then blipped out. the flashing helicopter started flying back and forth as it's helicopter buddies returned and then seemed to scavenge the area. after 5 minutes of making circles around each other the flashing helicopter turned off the light show it was giving and flew off with the other copters. i noticed a similar light to the one i saw over the east river far off in the south, what looked like it could have been over coney island, or manhattan beach.\" http:\\\\www.abovetopsecret.com\\forum\\thread364095\\pg1'"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11317.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11317.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/16/2008 02:12 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.716083","Case Number":"11317","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.716083,+-74.004523(11317)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11317) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/16/2008 02:12 UTC","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around June 16th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-06262008-0010","Longitude":"-74.004523"}
