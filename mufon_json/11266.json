Being an airline employee I first assumed the object to be a commercial airline with the sun reflecting off of its aluminum fuselage coming in for an approach to a local airport. I would guess object was 2,000 feet asl and it did not show any airspeed. The object was bright for one of the three seconds that we saw it and then for the two remaining seconds was a dark gray disk. the craft cloaked and became invisible after that so we pulled over to get out of the car to maybe hear or see the craft reappear but with no such luck"],"Date Submitted":"06/22/2008 10:30 UTC"}
