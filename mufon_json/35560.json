I said to my wife, there's a bald eagle out here do you want to see it. She replied, no. so I���m out watching this eagle soaring around for about a minute then in my view I caught sight of a sphere in the lower part of the binocular, it was white-ish in color, kind of like the color of a cloud, it had a soft glow to it, almost a translucent, I watched it for a minute or so before I couldn't track it any longer due to the other apt building obscuring the path the UFO was on. I knew it was a UFO when I saw it, I have seen a UFO one other time in my life, I was ten at the time of that sighting. I listen to George Noory on Coast to Coast every night at work and on the way home from work."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35560.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35560.html"]}
