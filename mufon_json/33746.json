Then 10 minutes later heard another hum. I got up and went to my bathroom window on the north side of my condo to look outside. I saw two round objects that appeared connected together, side by side and were moving from east to west and upward at a 75 degree angle until they disappeared, it only took about 10 seconds. The outside of the objects looked like they were covered in various colored bright crystals. Also there was one white light beam going downward from the objects that was well defined, not difuesed like a flashlight would be. The light went from bright at the object to less bright as it went down. The whole extent of light pulsated in brightness but did not change shape. I went back to bed and just layed there until I got up for work."],"Longitude":"-80.102969","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.674336,+-80.102969(33746)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33746) map </A>","Summary":"Two lights going up in sky","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/01/2011 02:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"33746","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/01/2011 11:35 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","City":"West Palm Beach","Source":"MUFON"}
