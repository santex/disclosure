I was going to my car and right before I got in I looked up at the stars like I always do. (it was dark out with a slight sliver of light) I saw a bight light moving fast, I thought it was a star at first, then I noticed it was moving Very fast, also there was no sound. Now living within 50 miles of a major airport I see planes and jets a lot, so I would know if it were one! Also it was way to high, I have seen comets and meteorites and could tell it was not one. After about 5 or 6 seconds of watching it, it quickly dissipated up higher within 2 seconds. Again it was crystal clear out, with a tiny bit of light, so it was easy to follow. I don't know what can move that fast, high (with the exception of a space ship, but I live in Kansas so probably not!) or not have a tiny bit of sound! I don't know if it was a UFO, but I don't know what else it could have been. If anyone else had seen it, please feel free to email me."],"Date of the Event":"11/04/2010 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Light flies fast across sky and dissapears"}
