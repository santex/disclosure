It \"floated\" for a while and then it just shot off in one direction at a seriously fast speed, if i blinked i would've most definitely missed it, but i felt like i couldnt move so i kept watching it. Certainly one of the most weirdest things i've ever seen and that has happened to me."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Date of the Event":"03/20/2009 09:10 UTC","Region":"England","Date Submitted":"03/20/2009 09:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"50.768035","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Eastbourne","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16159.html"],"Country":"United Kingdom","Summary":"Bright orb in sky hovering then zipping away.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
