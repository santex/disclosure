I noticed a glowing orange copper object to my front right. The object changed shape, like a blob in mid-air. It glowed brightly, but I can still look at it without squinting. I can see lines and indentations as it changed shape. I've never seen this before, and would like to know what it was. I've never seen anything that bright, look so clear."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Virginia","Longitude":"-77.479562","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 06:32 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Ashburn","There were no other sightings in Ashburn on or around August 1st 2012"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Egg, Oval, Sphere, Other","Case Number":"41718","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Ashburn","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41718.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41718.html"],"Summary":"Glowing orange/ copper orb","Log Number":"US-08132012-0026","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
