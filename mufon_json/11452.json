My mother is a skeptic so we woke her up to go see them. She came outside and was totally amazed. There was a UFO coming from downtown at a high speed and coming the opposite direction. We thought they were going to collide and they barely missed each other. This happened right above our house. After that happened they seemed to keep doing u-turns like they were showing off for us. It was hard to tell if there were more because they kept turning and vanishing randomly. After of that ended my mother went back inside. My girlfriend and I got on our bikes and when we got a block away another star like UFO appeared. This time it started coming down quickly. It looked like a little sphere maybe 8 ft around circumference. It came down then shot off over by Westminster."],"Longitude":"-105.779367","Date of the Event":"07/04/2008 11:07 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"00:29:00","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.551221,+-105.779367(11452)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11452) map </A>","Latitude":"39.551221","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"07/04/2008 11:07 UTC","Summary":"2 Star like UFOS and 1 Close Sphere UFO in North Denver"}
