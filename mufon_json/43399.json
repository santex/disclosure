Then I immediately noticed the bright lights hovering so close that it was seen easily from my front car window. I thought I was seeing a strange reflection from the window and just when I got a good look at it and could see it had two very large lights coming off its ends, it then took off at lightening speed and that is when I realized that I just seen my first UFO and looked at my car clock to get the time. My adrenaline was pumping so much that I still cant seem to settle down."],"Date Submitted":"10/19/2012 11:32 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Near University city","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"It hovered over I-70 and took off in lightening speed straight up","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.7743","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43399.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43399.html"]}
