This one time in the summer ( June or July) I observed a hugh object just overhead of me. It was stationary with very bright mwhite lights all around it and all over the platform. This event lasted about an hour. During this time I observed small Disks that to me resembled bottle caps approaching from each direction, stopping on the platform and then departing in the oposite direction. Finally I had to go home and to bed. I'm willing to take a polygraph test about this event. Other things have happened to me since this sighting."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
