First noticed massive donut shaped diffused object straight overhead traveling silently from south to north northwest. I had no initial idea what the object was or is as I have never encountered anything like it. I am an amateur astronomer and am constantly looking skyward for celestial objects. I had the strangest feeling that I was observing something otherworldly. At first I thought it might be aircraft landing lights reflecting off a thin layer of clouds or a layer of humidity but quickly discounted that possibility. I quickly jumped out of my chair and pointed at the object but my friends were unable to spot it. The object disappeared behind the building to the north of my building."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-81.741331","Summary":"Sitting on balcony, first noticed straight overhead, traveled north,northwest ascended slightly then faded off into distance.","Date Submitted":"03/17/2013 11:22 UTC","Log Number":"US-03172013-0007","City":"Marco Island","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Marco Island","There were no other sightings in Marco Island on or around March 16th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.908071,+-81.741331(46247)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46247) map </A>"}
