Looked up into the night sky just to observe stars. Thought it was a shooting star for an instant. The object was bright and all white, non flashing, circular with absolutely no sound. The object was surrounded with a white glow like aura which was slightly dimmer then the center source of light. It flew in a straight path overhead at about roughly 300 feet. Really curious as to what this was. Reactions from the three of us were \"what is that?\" We compared it to a few airplanes higher than the object and it varied greatly to that of a typical plane. We lost sight of the object due to cloud coverage."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"39750","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06232012-0022","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.900824","Longitude":"-80.17428","City":"Waynesburg","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Waynesburg","There were no other sightings in Waynesburg on or around June 23rd 2012"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 10:05 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/23/2012 10:34 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39750.html"],"Country":"United States"}
