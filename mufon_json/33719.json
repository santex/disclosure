{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Taken from my driveway. HD vid camera, on a tripod. Note 0:32-0:36 (you can see additional red strobe on the top) and 1:11 (it goes lime green)","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Ojai","Object Features":"Dome","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside and noticed the object changing colors rapidly. It looked to be flickering green, red and white strobe. I went inside and got my binoculars. Thru them the object appeared to be moving, but i knew that could be due to the binoculars. So I got my HD vid camera and first observed it hand held. I was so amazed by the sight that we got a tri-pod and set it up. The video at that point speaks for itself. Fading in and out, changing colors, red strobe on the surface, brilliant lime green body at times. It continued for about 40 mins and then i noticed a few regular looking planes approach it. After that it was gone in a few minutes. We observed 4 other sets of the same lights, in other parts of the horizon. I didn't film them as this one appeared to be the closest so I stayed on it. I have lots more video, but I only attached the one below due to the size (I shot in HD)."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Ojai","There were no other sightings in Ojai on or around November 29th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"11/30/2011 01:22 UTC","Region":"California","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33719.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33719.html"],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Diamond, Fireball","Case Number":"33719","Latitude":"34.444333","Log Number":"US-11302011-0002","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.444333,+-119.243555(33719)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33719) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/29/2011 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-119.243555"}
