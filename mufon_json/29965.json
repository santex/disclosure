Travelling southbound I-5 and getting close to the 164th st Exit i noticed a ball of red and white light hovering on the east side of I-5. As I drove closer i knew it was not a cell tower and there were fireworks going off underneath it. It hovered and didn't move and i took the 164th street exit to get some water at the well. Then I looked up i was not in direct line of sight. Then filled up my water bottle and proceed back on I-5 south and I pulled over to the shoulder and see I that object again and I located it. This time it was moving and heading east in fast rate of speed as it was climbing. The light was getting dimmer as it was travelling away. Then I noticed a second object trailing it and departed in the same manner. I filmed it on my cellphone but it could not pick it up. This was not a plane or a helicopter and I know when see those types of aircraft."],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2011 03:16 UTC","Summary":"Glowing red and white ball 2 of them","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Lynnwood","There were no other sightings in Lynnwood on or around July 4th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29965.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29965.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.82461,+-122.312661(29965)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29965) map </A>","Longitude":"-122.312661","Log Number":"US-07052011-0017","Case Number":"29965","City":"Lynnwood","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
