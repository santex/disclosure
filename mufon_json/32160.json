I was on my porch having a cigarette, and was looking up at the stars. as i was looking up, i saw a triangle with three red lights on the corners appear out of nowhere moving from south to north, as though it was invisible and appeared and then disappeared. I thought i was seeing things as i watched it move across the sky for about 30 secs and then it disappeared. It had no sound, I knew it was not a plane or helicopter. It was moving fast, but at the same time seemed like it was skipping across the sky. Due to the craft's lights gave the appearance of it skipping but i knew it was moving on a straight path."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
