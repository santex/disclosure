They are probably interested in the natural gas plant that was being built west of williston. It was noticed at night while i was waiting for my truck to unload, i watched it twinkling multi-colors for about 5-7 minutes. THEN it was exactly like the trail of a starship on Star trek. It went away to the right side of the moon, and was out of site within 1-2 seconds. It left with an orange trail, but a millasecond later in the second i watched, it went black for about another millasecondthen it must have hit another gear as i watched it leave The line to the eye was not straight but kinda arched as it went away. I could not believe i had witnessed thre speed of light or faster? I had mentioned it to another driver, the same night he seen a shooting star just stop around the same area in the sky. I have more sitings that i do have witnesses for. About 4 more for sure!! These are not contrieved stories. Have have trained eyes for details and memories."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.175926,+-103.884668(47299)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47299) map </A>","Object Shape":"Oval","Date of the Event":"01/20/2010 02:07 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Log Number":"US-05092013-0017","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Williston","There were no other sightings in Williston on or around January 20th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Williston","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"It might have been a mile across, distance 20 miles up ?","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"48.175926","Longitude":"-103.884668","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"47299","Object Features":"None"}
