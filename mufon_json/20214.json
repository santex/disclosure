(normally, there is no need to use flash for a sunset pic, the camera flash was set to auto at the time.) several raindrops can be seen falling in a downward direction and are blurry indicating movement. the rest of the scene is in clear view because i use a tripod mounted on a solid brick fence post. i usually judge focus in my pictures using the electrical wires between the towers that can be seen on either side of the sun (1\\3 mile away). zoom in to see the wires. all of the distant light sources are not blurred in any way. these light sources are at a local airport, the control tower (2 miles away) can be seen just to the right of the sun and left of the electrical tower. the thing that is unknown to me is the object to the left of the sun. when i took the picture, i don't remember seeing anything unusual, i was just taking a sunset picture. the object appears to be between me and the electrical wires. the object appears to be moving towards the camera and in a slightly upward direction. i also see three other bright objects (2 lower middle, 1 lower right of the view) above the ground on either side of a known dead pixel in my camera's ccd. they are not falling or showing much movement at all. not sure what those are. all of the other light sources in this pic are familiar to me. if you have the capability to analyze this picture, can you tell me what it is? i don't know. maybe it is just an optical effect of some sort due to the camera flash? could it be ball lightning? i don't remember hearing any associated thunder after i took the picture. in fact, there was no lightning at all generated by this particular storm cell. i used the camera's software to show the picture info for this shot in the attached files. let me know if you have any other questions, matt"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20214.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20214_submitter_file1__P7200014.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20214.html"],"Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON"}
