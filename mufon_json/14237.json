At that time she came in the house to wake me up. When I got to the back yard I saw a triangle shaped object fly over our house heading N.W. 3 lights with a big strobe in the center. WE live fairly close to the Portland, OR. airport and see aircraft fly over all the time and you can hear them. The one that went over the house heading N.W. made no sound what so ever. The other one headed N.E. and was to far away to make out its shape. And I could still see the one that shot straight up in the S.E. but was to far away to make out its shape. My wife said that they were all shaped like the one that went over the house heading N.W. Its just wierd that they didn't make any noise. Sorry that I didn't take a picture of it."],"Date of the Event":"12/05/2008 05:15 UTC","Case Number":"14237","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.646088,+-122.653286(14237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14237) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/05/2008 05:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around December 5th 2008"],"Longitude":"-122.653286"}
