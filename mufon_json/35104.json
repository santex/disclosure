As I slowed down to look at it, it began to move in a western direction. In what time it took for him to get the camera up on my phone it had moved a LONG way VERY. So far that I could not find it in the view finder. As it passed in front of my van, it was actually flying quite low. Low enough that we could tell that it was actually cigar shaped and very shiney white. It was low enough that we could tell that there were no wings and it DEFINITELY WAS NOT an air plane."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.522051,+-86.572647(35104)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35104) map </A>","Summary":"Fast moving cigar shaped object","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35104.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35104.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/24/2012 07:35 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-86.572647","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/24/2012 12:09 UTC","trends":[]}
