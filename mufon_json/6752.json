It seemed to stay kind of at an angle, like Saturn's rings are, and moved very slowly over downtown Midland or between the interstate and downtown Midland. We were to the South of the city I believe. But anyhow, it seemed to move very slowly, then just disappeared, didn't shoot off, just disappeared. Then it reappeared with two objects and seemed to circle like Vultures. They circled for a bit, then faded away. That was the end of it, I looked hard for a while, but never did see them again. Also, there was a truck driving along side of us looking in the same direction at the same time we were, so we are assuming that they were watching this too. Although, there were no reports that were made, or that gained any attention, in Midland, TX."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Appeared and went away a couple times.","City":"Odessa","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"6752","Log Number":"US-04042007-0006","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Odessa","There were no other sightings in Odessa on or around April 1st 2007"],"Latitude":"31.852282","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/01/2007 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-102.363073","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval"}
