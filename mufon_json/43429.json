Looked up at Orion's belt and to the left was a huge, black triangle with white running lights which were sequential and counter-clockwise. Looked away from it (I must be seeing things...) looked back, still there, observed for approximately 1 hour before going back to bed. The site has had a lasting impact on me. I looked again in Feb 2012 - did not see it again. It was the full moon time of February 2011, around the 16th. Sorry for late reporting - but everyone knows why - - Happy hunting."],"Object Features":"None"}
