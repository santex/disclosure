In those short moments the object was already east of us and seemed at times to slow down and zig zag as it continued along its path until it was out of sight over the eastern horizon... We also noticed an airplane in the north east travelling east that had nearly no similarities in mannerism as the object we witnessed."],"Latitude":"34.6171","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04182013-0003","Source":"MUFON"}
