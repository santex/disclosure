{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking home from my girlfriends house and as I was walking up the avenue something caught my eye. I looked to the northwest sky and saw a flickering green rectangular light. It moved slowly down towards the horizon as it flickered continuosly. Then suddenly it stops flickering and speeds up. As it speeds up it grows in length, then suddenly it dissapears into the sky. It stayed neon-green throughout the whole time. At first i thought it was that effect that occurs when you look directly at a light then elsewhere but this was not the case because the light was vivid, had a definate shape and did not change color."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18518.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18518.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","City":"Campos Altos","Date of the Event":"08/07/2009 01:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Brazil","Date Submitted":"08/07/2009 01:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-19.69744,+-46.169052(18518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18518) map </A>","Longitude":"-46.169052","Log Number":"BR-08072009-0002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Campos Altos","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"-19.69744","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Minas Gerais","Case Number":"18518","Summary":"GREEN STREAK OF LIGHT IN SKY"}
