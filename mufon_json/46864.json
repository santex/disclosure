(omg please, i'm sorry to discredit with batman >< ) it was not stealth bomber shaped like our bombers (triangle), it was not like any aircraft or prototype i know of (fixed wing, kit, rc or recon and please, i know i'm not an expert but i do follow aircraft body styles for years now) or even conspiratorial shaped rumored craft (some of the more... 'creative' reports i've seen, this was not like that). this was, again, organic in shape, very flowing and curved and natural .. simply put it was a very beautiful silhouette of a black ship. this craft featured at least two very bright lights on the bottom, closer to the perimeter of the ship on \"either side\". i could see such lights positioned in that manner being helpful for landing (like flood lights or alley lights on a squad car), but this craft did not land or make any move to do so. after it descended a small bit (like i said, it was very high in the sky, so this descending still left it pretty far above our heads) and we got a very good confirmation of what we saw (no guessing was possible at that point as the fogginess was no longer between the craft and our eyes) - it seems like time kinda stretched out in a weird way. if we had been online, i would describe it like we were having a latency issue or \"lag\" for a minute - we had a strange non-physical impression of communication (contents below). then everything snapped back to normal speed...the craft slowly rotated a bit farther to the east (originally ne) and moved off very slowly, gracefully. no trail or track or disruption in the \"fog\" or the clouds in the area (and an entirely different altitude than the \"fog\") was apparent. 5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. after everything was over, we felt pretty humbled to have been allowed to see this. but at first we were in disbelief and incredulous and feeling a little silly. during the event, and as indicated above after the craft \"came down\" a little, the non-physical\\emotional wave hit us. it was really definite. it unwaveringly did feel like the craft was there on purpose, that exact spot and time as we were lying on our backs looking straight up at the sky. it absolutely did feel as if the craft was benevolent or perhaps the beings inside it were\\are benevolent, if there were any beings (that part i would have no way to know, we could not see anything like that). we did not feel threatened or scared, never mind the fact that this massive object was exactly above our house with the kids asleep inside (which would normally have sent me into fits). quite honestly, there was nothing negative about this experience - it felt strongly at the time that a transmission was sent but i can't tell you the means of transmission. here is what i received although it does not translate out exactly - \"be at ease. yes, yes, we are here. thank you, thank you for being aware of us - we are most honored. we are visiting [you all] to say hello, we will return later in a more long-term capacity, we will not leave you again.\" other than not immediately understanding the implications of the message, the feeling was very loving and connected but a bit formal and * very official *. the words \"here\", \"aware\", \"you all\" really felt more like, \"we are now permitted to let you know we are are here\", \"thank you for bringing us into your awareness\", and \"the waiting ones\" or \"those who are watching for us\". the words don't fully communicate what was transmitted but that's my best recollection - it was very intense and happy. 6. how did you lose sight of the object? it left. i guess there was more on the agenda that night than just hanging out in houston with a couple of nerds in the back yard ;) ."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46864.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46864.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"bright lights in sky, very high, stationary. lights pulsed twice, craft descended below cloud bank then rotated and headed east. completely silent.","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-95.174328","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in New Caney","There were no other sightings in New Caney on or around April 17th 2013"],"Object Features":"Wings, Other"}
