I looked down to type something into google, i looked up about a minute later and it was gone. I live under an airport's flight path, but i've seen enough planes to know, that wasn't one. I laso noticed further away in the distance when i look up after typing into google, a faint light changing colour flying very fast of into the distant ( too fast for anything of human technology) though this time it looked more like a missle of somekind, maybe chasing after previous object, i am very terrified of what i have just seen and at this moment in time i am getting shivers up my spine just thinking and typing about it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Orange glowing spherical light","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Glasgow","There were no other sightings in Glasgow on or around February 23rd 2010"],"Log Number":"GB-02232010-0010","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like, Teardrop","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21994.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21994.html"]}
