It began to move to the east at a fast pace until it seemed to disappear behind a cloud. The object never reappeared. It was MUCH to large to be a plane and was so bright it looked like a large ball of fire. I heard no sound until I lost sight of it at which time I heard a loud noise I have never heard before. It almost sounded like Godzilla."]}
