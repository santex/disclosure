It was too slow to be a plane or a meteorite but it was slowly moving and the brightness kept changing at times. We had thunder and lightning that night but it had not hit us it was still a about an hour away. But in the distance we could see lightning and it looked purple near the object. Then after a while it had rainbow colored rays shining out. Eventually it traveled out of sight. I don't know what it was but it was different to anything else I've ever seen."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like","Country":"New Zealand"}
