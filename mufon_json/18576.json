Watched it move around and change directions several times, although it continually made its way from south to north. We got the binoculars out and the camera. Could never see it that clearly, just that it seemed strange. Once I was able to look at the pictures I took and zoom in on them, I was amazed at what I saw. May be something from the military, but nothing like anything I've seen before. Triangle shape with what looks like 3 big booster engines in the back. Watched it until it was too far away to see. I don't wish to attach the photos here."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.6237","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Greenwood Village","There were no other sightings in Greenwood Village on or around June 15th 2006"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Saw object flying through sky from south to north","Weather Factors":"None"}
