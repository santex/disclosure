I tried multiple times to take a picture of it, but it moved very quickly this way, then that way. I snapped several photos, but didn't think I got anything...until today when I checked all my photos on the computer. I saw that I had caught it in the corner of the shot, just barely. I have two photo's one is raw and one has been cropped, enlarged, sharpened and the contrast and brightness was removed so you can really see it in good detail. Surreal."],"Source":"MUFON"}
