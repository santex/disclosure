They have bright orange lights which go from very bright to non-existant. They make no sound and either hover in one spot or move across the sky, sometimes slowly and sometimes very fast. They are in the shape of a \"V\" from what he can tell. He called me last around 7:00 pm and said they were back again. This time I drove to his house and observed them myself. I found them to be everything that he claimed. His neighbors had been watching these crafts just as he had been. I took a picture since I brought my camera. Looking through the camera viewfinder they appeared as just kind of light dots. When I uploaded the photo to my computer they definitly appeared to have a \"V\" shape. If you want to see them, come by next Thursday or give me a number I can call when they arrive."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/09/2012 01:23 UTC","Latitude":"42.601378","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-11092012-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.601378,+-82.983335(43797)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43797) map </A>","Summary":"Every Thurs. bet. 7 and 9 for past 3 wks. 2-3 bright hovering objects","City":"Sterling Heights","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43797.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43797.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
