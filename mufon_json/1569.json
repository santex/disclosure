I noticeda bright star moving very slowly across the sky from SW towards the NW. Then aswe were watching it, we noticed at least fifteen more. They sometimes movedaround each other, changed direction, changed speed, and at one point an objectsplit into two objects. They were going in different directions at the sametime and were changing speeds. The objects seemed to have a reflective surfacelike glass that would seem to reflect the sun. There was also one, much lower,black pod shaped object that flew quickly (within 30 seconds) from east to west,then south. This is the second time in about six months that weve seensomething like this. The first time we were impressed, but wrote it off fairlyquickly.
