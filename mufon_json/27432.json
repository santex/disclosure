My Aunt Flo has what she thinks, this was supposedly to be a close encounter of the third kind, when she was startled when a brilliant bright light up in the sky while she was in the storeroom of her own diner that shad used to own back during the 1970s. She had heard a strange sound and she had rushed out of the backdoor and then she apparently sees a UFO.
