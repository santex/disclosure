It was a very clear sky, cold, but otherwise a perfect night to watch the sky. My wife and I were looking up, as we do every night, when we noticed what looked like a star that was moving from south to north. A minute or so later we noticed another then another and so on. My first thought was a satellite but then we saw the others. We kept looking while we were outside but didnt see any more. After dinner we pulled up nasa sat tracker and checked to see if it showed any sats passing over north Texas but it did not. About 9pm we put kids to bed and went out for a smoke and there was another star moving across the sky. We go outside to smoke every night and never really see anything that we cant explain. These were too slow to be shooting stars, we watch those all the time. They did not flash or change in intensity other than fading away as they got father away."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14803.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14803.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.099561","City":"Burkburnett","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/06/2009 07:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.099561,+-98.567163(14803)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14803) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/06/2009 07:00 UTC","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"14803","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.567163","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"5 star-like lights moving across the sky.","Log Number":"US-01062009-0017"}
