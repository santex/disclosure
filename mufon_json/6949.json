My wife was on her way to work in sullivan gardens coming from bloomingdale. On John B Dennis hwy she saw a triangle shaped object below the clouds with lights on 2 ends and a green sqaure in the middle which she said looked like 2 \"people\" were kind of standing in looking down. She started searching for her camera phone. and turned around at indian path hospital but when she got back across the hill the object had vanished. She called me afterwards pretty upset. She said at first she thought her eyes were playing tricks on her. She was Skeptical before this happened. She said it made her feel really wierd and strange and was actually worried that they were watching her. This is a true story. I have no reason nor the time to be on here telling bogus storys. My wife is very concerned and somewhat scared about this incident so if u have similar reports or a debunk could u please email me. Thanks.
