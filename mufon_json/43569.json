{"Summary":"Looked like a helicopter without blades had a solid red light on the nose and engulfied in flames","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","divs":["Sighting DetailsOutside having a smoke on the phone with roommate that was at work. I looked up at the sky and saw what looked like a helicopter that was on fire it was moving in a straight like but the helicopter thing was angled toward me as the entire thing moved at an angle in a straight line. Hard to explain I figured somebody else would know apparently people all over the world seen fireball like ufo's that night. It was low enough that It looked like a police helicopter looking for somebody but there was no light oh beam shining down from it. That's all I could see or remember nothing on the news about a helicopter crash or anything like that in my area I just thought it was weird. It moved towards downtown Columbus away from my neighbor hood. Didn't seem to stop or poke around at anything at all."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/27/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.991764","Object Shape":"Fireball","Case Number":"43569","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.965926,+-82.991764(43569)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43569) map </A>","City":"Columbus","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around September 27th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43569.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43569.html"],"Log Number":"US-10282012-0009","Latitude":"39.965926","Date Submitted":"10/28/2012 10:43 UTC","Region":"Ohio"}
