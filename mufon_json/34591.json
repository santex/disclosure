I Was driving from Southampton Pa to Rockledge Pa, heading south on rt232, Second street pike. For 15 min I observed a bright white light in the SW sky. It was a steady light in the sky that appeared to be brighter than a star or satellite. As I drove down the pike through various turns the light remained bright, and not dimming.This I thought to be unusual.I crossed over Philmont ave and noticed that It was closer to me now in the sky. Within 45 seconds I noticed 5 bright white lights in a straight line just above the tree line and approaching me. I pulled over my car and got out. I observed these bright lights as it flew directly over me. It was a clear night and what I saw was a triangular shaped craft with a red and green light in the front center of the craft. Also were two sets of bright white lights on what appeared to be its wings. It was about 500 yards directly above me. It sounded like a low engine noise and was flying at about 50 mph. I thought that it might be a government plane. However I lived within 3 miles of Willow Grove Air base for 36 years and never seen anything like that nor was this a normal flight path for aircraft.I'm not sure what it was but I was excited to see it. I tried to get a picture of it with my phone, but I was to fixated on the object. I eventually lost sight of it as it past over the tree line."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"34591","Source":"MUFON"}
