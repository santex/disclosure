It was above the Six Flags theme park in Arlington, Texas. It moved from left to right in a flash and disappeared. In the movement of the light, it had a mysterious wave moving through, like a flag would wave in the wind or a bed sheet when one would fluff it when spreading it out on a bed. There was no thunder-storm activity that evening. I spent the rest of the morning trying to rationalize what I had seen. I called the Arlington Police department to check if anyone else had called about the strange light. At the time of the call, nobody had reported any such information."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.744917,+-97.107006(11929)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11929) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08052008-0001","Date of the Event":"07/30/2008 01:10 UTC","Latitude":"32.744917","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-97.107006","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash, Square, Rectagular"}
