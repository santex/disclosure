I kept watching and saw the sphere break into 8 other smaller spheres yet they were still large enough to see with the naked eye. 5 of the spheres quickly desceneded below the original point of view and began to flicker in an, \"on and off\" type of motion. Almost like someone was turning on and off a series of lights. Seconds later those lights stood still and changed direction by shooting towards the nw. I didnt see them after that yet the original light continued to hover and then just faded."],"trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around March 4th 2013"]}
