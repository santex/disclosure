My friend and I were just walking and i looked up (randomly). At first, I thought they were planes. But then I saw one just freeze in mid air. Then the two other ones started flying towards each other and then move away, like a game. I showed my friend and he looked. He didn't see anything, so he just thought i was joking. When we walked a little further, i showed him again. They were a little more visible now. He could see them now and freaked out like \"oh my god we gotta call someone!\". We caught up with my other friends and they saw them right away. Only one of my friends' couldn't see them. They were appearing and disappearing. We watched them for a bit and then they finally disappeared. We're still amazed at what we saw."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"41.091245","Longitude":"-81.510895","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"16000","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
