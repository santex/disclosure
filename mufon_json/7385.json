About 9:25 P.M. a twinkiling light in odd patterns appeared. People were lined up on Mt. Hermon road and began commenting \"look at the UFO.\" For the next 15 minutes the lights made a circular pattern around the fireworks display, going above it, and making a large circle in the sky. The lights were all over the place. My wife began to take pictures and short video clips. (Using a 10x optical zoom). After the fireworks were over, the lights no longer made a circle and left. The surprise came when we enlarged the video in the camera and just about freaked out. It reminded me of the Dropa stone. Very strange! This may be the best picture of a UFO ever taken. Note: Picture #1 is the raw photo; picture #2 is zoomed in."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2007 09:25 UTC","Region":"California","Case Number":"7385","City":"Scotts Valley"}
