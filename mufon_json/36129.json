{"divs":["Sighting Details At about 10pm last night I took my dog out for his nightly dutys . I was looking at the sky for any ufos and how the stars had changed positions . My dog wanted in the house NOW . I let him and somethng caught my eye . It was 2 orbs that was hovering by my neighbors yard . I watched it and ( I had my night vision glasses with me ) The orb was round . But when I looked at it without the night vision it had spikes radiating from it . I started to talk to it and it came a little closer . Then it went back to where it was I also noticed that there was a second orb that was smaller to the left of it. it just sat there and did not move . About 20 minutes later I got a call on Skype and I had to answer it so I left the orbs and went into the house . I don't know , But I feel I will see them again Don't ask me why Thank You"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.614673,+-88.306731(36129)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36129) map </A>","Summary":"Even Field investigators have sightings","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36129.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36129.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"36.614673","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-02272012-0011","Longitude":"-88.306731","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"02/27/2012 12:33 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Case Number":"36129","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Murray","There were no other sightings in Murray on or around February 26th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Murray","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
