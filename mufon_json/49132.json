{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside the shop to have a cigarette. I noticed how pretty the sun looked behind the clouds and decided to take a picture. I didn't like that the first one had the trailer a connex box in it, so I walked out into the field and took another. I uploaded the photo (portrait layout) to Facebook and noticed the unknown object in the picture. I didn't actually see it before the picture because the sun was bright. I have both pictures (uploaded), taken maybe 30 seconds apart. Photos taken with my iPhone 4."],"Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49132.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49132.html"],"Longitude":"-121.572764","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.031321,+-121.572764(49132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49132) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.031321","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Gilroy","Case Number":"49132","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07232013-0008","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/23/2013 11:47 UTC","Summary":"Tood a picture of the sunrise, posted it to facebook and noticed this.","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Gilroy","There was one other sighting in Gilroy on or around July 23rd 2013"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/23/2013 08:44 UTC"}
