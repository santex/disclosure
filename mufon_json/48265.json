When leaving a relatives house, I noticed several small orange lights is the sky in a formation, some moved some did not. Realizing I had to go back to my relatives house because a cell phone was forgotten, I turned around and headed back for the house. At the house, one one orange glowing fire ball was visible due to trees. When I got back to the place where I saw the formation, only one lager orange looking fire ball was in the sky that was stationary. There were no flashing air plane lights and it seemed to hover. I did not stay to witness any more since I had to be at another destination. Once I made my way to I 5, I no longer saw the object. What I say was out of the ordinary and not a normal air craft that one see in the sky. Could have been a orb as well."],"Latitude":"47.984085","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48265.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48265.html"]}
