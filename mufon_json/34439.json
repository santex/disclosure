{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and I witnessed what appeared to be red-orange fireball-like objects fly over our neighborhood in Oviedo, FL during our Christmas Eve party sometime around 9:45pm-10:00pm. The object was first seen by a family member who happened to spot the objects coming over the backyard of the house. As time went on more family members rushed out to see the objects which by then were flying over the front of the house by which time one object had turned away and gone out of sight. The other continued in a southeasterly path losing sight of as it near the forest in the horizon. The red-orange fireball object was completely different from aircraft sighted in the sky around the same time. My brother, an aircraft mechanic and I, an aerospace engineering student discussed the sighting and where unable to identify the object. The object was also away from the side of sky where Cape Canaveral launches can be seen, and there where no rocket launches scheduled for that night. No sound could be heard from the objects, it was like nothing we've ever seen before."],"Log Number":"US-12312011-0023","Longitude":"-81.510554","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34439.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34439.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667897,+-81.510554(34439)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34439) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Fireball-like object seen on Christmas Eve","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/31/2011 10:13 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/24/2011 10:00 UTC","trends":[],"Latitude":"27.667897","Case Number":"34439","Country":"United States"}
