I saw a round orange sphere. The time was about 7:50pm to 7:52pm. I estimate seeing it for about 2 minutes. After it was no longer visible I checked the time and it was 7:52pm. It was bright orange���steady color of light with nothing blinking at all. No FFA marking lights. In size appearance, it was about 3 times larger than the planet Jupiter from my location. I was in West Valley City traveling north. The object was north of me. It was heading eastward towards down town Salt Lake City. It was near the Salt Lake International Airport. I was driving, so I pulled over and stopped. I turned off the engine and got out of my truck. It was slowly moving and was at about 3,500 feet off the ground. It was just barley high enough to clear the mountain ranges east of Salt Lake City valley. A few seconds after I got out of my truck it stopped too. It hovered for about 15 seconds. It was silent. Then it took off in a north northeastward direction. As it took off it appeared to almost turned red orange, it appeared to be accelerating fast and climbing in altitude on or about a 30 degree angle upward... then it dimmed and was orange in color again. It rapidly kept dimming and disappeared. I mean disappeared as in disappeared before it flew away. It did not disappear from sight due to distance."],"Summary":"Round Orange Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"12/26/2011 07:51 UTC","Case Number":"34332","City":"Salt Lake City","Date Submitted":"12/27/2011 12:14 UTC","Log Number":"US-12272011-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.763479,+-111.882327(34332)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34332) map </A>","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34332.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34332_submitter_file1__RoundOrangeSphere.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34332.html"],"Latitude":"40.763479","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Utah"}
