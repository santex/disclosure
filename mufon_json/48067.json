{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Virginia","Summary":"twin aluminum colored spheres moving in parallel at constant speed","divs":["sighting detailsalthough this event occurred several years ago, it is still very clear in my mind because it was unusual and i could not explain it. after a quick summer rainstorm early one evening, my brother and i were perched on the hood of his 1971 plymouth duster which was parked on the street and were each drinking a beer. we were facing north up the street when two spheres appeared over the horizon to the north. these spheres roughly followed the road. they passed overhead and we lost sight of them as they fell below the horizon to the south. they were probably in sigh for 60 seconds or so, give or take 20 seconds. what was unusual was the constant speed (not a high speed, but not slow either, maybe 40-50 mph but hard to say without reference points) at which they both moved, in parallel, and in a straight line. it was difficult to tell how high they were, but they were under the disapating cloud cover remaining fron the storm, maybe 1000-1500 feet. they were unaffected by the wind which was blowing at ground level at 10-15 mph. there was no sound, no light, no emissions coming from the spheres. it was difficult to judge their size as they were not near other objects for any reference point and their height was unknown, but a rough estimate is 25-30 feet in diameter. from the ground, the size appeared to be that of baseballs. they did not seem to be reflecting light (nneded to check to submit), as their silver\\aluminum color did not vary. i am writing this to you at this time because y'all may have encountered something similar in your research and i would like to know what these spheres might have been. at first we though they may have been weather balloons, but we ruled these out because of the constant speed and straight line motion. i am interested in your thoughts and whether you have any other similar sightings. year of observation could have been 1975-1978, date sometime in mid-late summer. thanks."],"Log Number":"US-06112013-0023","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.89951","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48067.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48067.html"],"Longitude":"-77.143345","City":"Arlington","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around August 15th 1975"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"48067","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"06/11/2013 08:28 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/15/1975 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.89951,+-77.143345(48067)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48067) map </A>"}
