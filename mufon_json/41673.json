I saw the first glowing object in the sky north, traveling in a easterly fashion. It was fuzzy so i tried to refocus my eyes to no avail. That first object went behind my maple tree and as I saw glimpses peeking through the leaves, i noticed I couldnt see it any longer. I walked out to where my yard meets my hay field [about 75 feet] From here I could see the area behind my tree but the object was gone. There was never any sound. Thinking literally \"what the hell did I just see\" I scanned the sky and a second object was visible NNW lower in the sky, and seemingly a bit further away. Same deal....... it looked identical to the first object in every way. I got my cell phone out and recorded two short clips but the video is just dark. That second object moved a short distance in the sky and then turned 75 degrees and disapeared shortly there after."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Hunlock Creek","Longitude":"-76.115524","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
