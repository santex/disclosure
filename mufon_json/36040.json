I saw a really bright light towards the south as I was approaching the bridge. It wasn���t moving. At first I thought it was a really tall cell tower or something like that, but as I got nearer the bridge I noticed it was not on the side of the road, but over it. It still wasn���t moving and as I got closer I saw it had four horizontal bright white lights in a row, like a light bar you���d see in a bathroom, but the two lights on the edges were much brighter and flashing brighter and dimmer. It was about the size of a jumbo jet���s wing span but the lights were much too big for it to have been a plane. I���m not a great judge of distance especially at night and when I cannot judge the entire size of something, but I���d say it was less than 1000 feet above the ground���.and then I drove right underneath it. It didn���t move. I felt like this was not normal. If a plane it would have to move, and it wasn���t shaped like a helicopter. It was a straight bar with four distinct lights in a row."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Newburgh","There were no other sightings in Newburgh on or around February 23rd 2012"],"Log Number":"US-02242012-0012","Date of the Event":"02/23/2012 10:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.520889,+-74.006105(36040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36040) map </A>"}
