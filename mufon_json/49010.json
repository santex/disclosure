{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside looking at the sky when a bright orange flash caught my eye the flash was the object coming into sight from behond horizon my first though was it was a meteor burning up but wasn't burning up it flew directly over me and the orange light I saw seeing was unlike any orange I light I have ever seen before it only lasted about 7 seconds before clearing the opposite horizon, I may add that this is the same date people in nyc claimed to see ufos and was on the news. I saw what many people must of pointed up and shouted for everyone to look at saw. I now conclude that the orange light was ionized air around the craft used for magnetic propulsion. ill never forget the sight."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49010.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49010.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Region":"New Jersey","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.995197","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.995197,+-74.283241(49010)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49010) map </A>","Longitude":"-74.283241","Country":"United States","City":"Pompton Lakes","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07172013-0011","Summary":"thought was a meteor burning up came from one horizon directly over me dissaperard over the oppisite horizon bright orange super fast object","Date of the Event":"10/13/2010 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"49010","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Pompton Lakes","There were no other sightings in Pompton Lakes on or around October 13th 2010"],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2013 06:36 UTC","Tags":"City"}
