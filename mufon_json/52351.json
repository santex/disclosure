She told me to look toward the Orion constellation which I did. When I looked at it through my binoculars I saw a very bright object that was flashing red and blue lights as an airplane or helicopter does. It did not move at all. I went into the house and came back out about 20 minutes later at which time it was gone.I have no idea what is was but I find it very strange that both myself in upstate NY and my daughter in NC could see the exact same thing at the same time."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52351.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52351.html"],"Latitude":"42.151897","Case Number":"52351","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.151897,+-79.636915(52351)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52351) map </A>","Longitude":"-79.636915","Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Bright star-like orb with flashing blue and red lights","Date of the Event":"11/20/2013 11:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Sherman","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sherman","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"N/A"}
