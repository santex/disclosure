I had both my 3 year old and my 5 year old with me. Both children remarked that they could see stars. I looked up and said yes you can seeing just a few stars. I turned to check the grill and my 5 year old said \"whats that\" I looked up and I saw 12 to 18 V shaped objects flying over heading east. At first I thought they were a flock of birds back lighted by the sodium vapor lighting in a shopping center near by but they were moving way too fast and were at an altitude that I don't belive birds can fly. They were flying in a straight line across they sky. Some moved position from side to side. I have never seen anything like this and I was wondering if anyone else has reported anything like this?"],"Log Number":"US-06052009-0003","Region":"Illinois","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lake Zurich","There were no other sightings in Lake Zurich on or around June 3rd 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-88.090071","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"42.199959","Date of the Event":"06/03/2009 09:15 UTC","Case Number":"17344","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Overflight of several orange colored V shaped objects.","City":"Lake Zurich","Date Submitted":"06/03/2009 09:15 UTC"}
