I was watching my boys play in their swimming pool. I happened to look up at the sky. Their were very few clouds. I noticed a Very fast flying sphere extremely high in the sky. I first thought it was an airplane, but it was totally round in shape. I didn't notice any wings. That's when I got excited. I didn't hear any noise. It was moving SE to NW in a straight line. I see planes all of the time, from passenger planes to military planes high in the atmosphere. The object I saw left no exhaust trails and moved faster then any flying object I have ever seen. It was only in view for less 30 seconds. If I didn't look up when I did, i would have missed it."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24314.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24314.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/03/2010 01:00 UTC","Summary":"Very fast flying sphere.
