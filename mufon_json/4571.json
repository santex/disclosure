SO here goes ��� a Personal entry for you to send on to MUFON if you like. I was 22. Late on a June evening (11 pm or so) I wrapped up a scrabble game with my folks and while dad made a nightcap I headed outside for a little air. It was a clear night with a slight breeze, just enough to get rid of Mosquitoes. (I was home on the farm doing a summer project through college). My dad farmed about 280 acres West of the County Road 2, about ��� mile South of what is called The Summer Road. On the East side of the road is Billy Hagen���s land (Billy now owns dad���s old place, the Hemmingson farm back then) . There is a little grove a bit north of where our road meets Country Road 2. Bill had the field planted in wheat that summer. There is a narrow ditch grade to the right of our road, maybe a couple hundred yards or so. And as I stood by the edge of Billy���s field, I saw this little light coming down that Ditch Grade, maybe 20 feet up or even less. Now, there is a little municipal air port in Warroad, 12 miles East and another in Roseau, 17 miles est. But this thing made NO NOISE. And as I stood there I saw this circle of lights going around it, blue and white I think. It was small. And then the object stopped. That���s when it hit me ��� a UFO. About this time I also realized everything had gone still ��� the crickets and frogs were silent, like they are when a predator is around. All I could hear was my heartbeat and the wind on the wheat. Now the object slid left, and then right, in a perfect horizontal plane. That again confirmed UFO In my mind since I know of nothing else that can move like that. I guess I stood there looking at it for maybe 2 minutes and then, still utterly silent, it arched up into the sky at an impossible speed (VERY HIGH!) and zipped overhead and down the Western Horizon. It moved so fast I could scarcely turn my head fast enough and it STREAKED is moved so fast. Afterward I told my father who was very moved by this and we stood out there for some time. HE told me about some of the recent sightings ��� don���t recall if he mentioned the sheriff one at that time but I know I heard about it from my folks so it was either After this or Before it. There had also been cattle killings and The vet had never seen anything like them ��� these cattle had NO BLOOD and No wounds that he could find (nothing like the ���mutilation��� cases that so many Say are just what animals look like after bloating. Any farmer or vet would know the difference. Don���t know if these were related but a lot of us wondered."],"Summary":"Low flying/hovering lenticular disk with rotating lights","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"4571","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4571.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4571.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/30/1979 11:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"48.905266","Longitude":"-95.314404","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.905266,+-95.314404(4571)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4571) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Warroad","There were no other sightings in Warroad on or around June 30th 1979"],"Date of the Event":"06/30/1979 11:00 UTC","City":"Warroad","Object Shape":"Circle"}
