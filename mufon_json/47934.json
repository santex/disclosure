It was making no sound and acending to the west. I called my wife out to see it which she did. About 1 minute later another one the same size followed behind it. It was no airplane. They were not navigation or collision lights or strobes. There were a couple of high altitude airliners at the same time but not near the sightings. My neighbor across the street witnessed it also. I took some video with my cell phone but by the time I got my phone it was just a light in the video. Not much to see."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"39.701332","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Summary":"very bright pulsating red/orange silent light","Case Number":"47934"}
