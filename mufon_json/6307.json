Nick lives about 2 miles from use in about the center of Picayune at 117 South Steele Ave. Upon arriving there, Nick made a comment; Matthew had said ���There were going to be UFO tonight.��� I told Nick that his imagination was running on overtime. We left Nick house at about 7:50 PM. We took a left on Second St., then a left on S. Haugh Ave., then a right on Memorial Blvd. and a left on HWY. 11 S. The traffic light was green. Just as the road straighten out my boy yell out, ���Holy snap there back again���. We notices 2 objects moving west, south west over the track. I slowed down, rolled the window down and turn off the radio and watch them move more to the west so I took a right on Martin Luther King Blvd. There was a car in front of use going about 25 to 30 MPH. The objects were on my side of the truck, I was looking towards the south west. We could see the front object underside. It had 4 or 5 blue lights under it, a yellow light above it and a red blinking light in front of it. We could not see the blue lights if any under the second object, but we could see the yellow light on top and a blinking red light in front but it did have 3 white lights on what could be the side. We have seen these white lights on the front object just before we could see the blue lights. We could not tell the shape of the object. Martin Luther King Blvd. curves north and stop at Jackson Landing Rd. I turn off the engine. There was no sound at all coming from the objects. The objects were now in front of use, about a quarter mile away. We made a right turn east on Jackson Landing Rd. Which turns into Bruce St.. We took a left on Main St. heading north. The objects were to the left of my windshield and moving away. The only thing we could see is there white light and a blinking red light. They were about 2 miles away. We caught the traffic light at HWY.11 N. and Forth St. The HWY. runs north, north east. By the time we arrived at the intersection of HWY. 11 and HWY 43 the objects had went over HWY 11 and now moving east. We turned right on HWY 43 and finally lost sight of them over the horizon north east from us. The objects had appeared to circle the city. We took I-59 South to Nicholson about 4 miles and then north on HWY 11 for a mile to our house. It was now 8:20 PM. ??? Are we seeing Military aircrafts? I know there is navigation beacon north of us that the Military aircraft use in training and there is Stennis Space Center, south from us. Do these Lights fit any types of Aircrafts??? This is our second sighting, Dec. 5, 2005, TUESDAY 7:25 PM was our first sighting. Is there any other people in our area see these things??? Names & numbers would be nice so maybe we could form a watch group."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","City":"Picayune","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-02032007-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.526759,+-89.669988(6307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6307) map </A>","Region":"Mississippi","Date Submitted":"01/30/2007 07:55 UTC","Case Number":"6307"}
