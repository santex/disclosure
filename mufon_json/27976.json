(he likens the altitude to about 10 feet above a nearby 40 foot tree. male witness says there were rings on the underside of the object, and that as he looked up, the center ring projected\\moved downward perhaps 10 feet under the object. he specifies his position as under the northern edge of the center ring. he says the ring opened and expelled some sort of balls the size of baseballs and\\or softballs, with perhaps one or two the size of basketballs, which then landed on his hat, arms and legs (anc caused some sensation on his arm hair), and that these no-weight balls somehow caused him to have odd perceptions as he stood there. for instance, it seemed that the balls caused him to feel himself standing a distance behind himself, watching himself standing at the gate. he speaks as if there was a kind of bubble effect, but with no sheen to it, and when he looked at the bubble, it was as if the bubble projected images of the garage or himself, etc. but only projected images the size of the bubbles\\balls themselves, not the actual size of the garage or himself, etc. he says he wonders if it's like looking into another dimension. following his experience with the balls,the craft expelled\\formed a haze surrounding itself. to the witness, it seemed as if all this was happening in a very brief few seconds or 2-3 minutes at the most, but when the balls stopped interacting with him, he thought to wonder if his wife had gotten the camera, and began walking west toward the backyard fence where she was positioned some 70 feet away. as he walked, his perception was that the object, including the haze, began to float\\move slowly to the west with him, and as he approached the backyard fence gate, he saw that his wife was taking pictur4es, which he thought were photographs with their digital camera. however, from dialogue on a 2 minute, 20-second videotape of the ufo, discovered a couple weeks later when viewing a crop duster video taken in july, 2010, it appears that his wife was actually just finishing taping the ufo video. (((as he approached his wife in the back yard, the dialogue heard in the last few seconds on the video is as follows: as her husband is approaching, the wife calls out, \"i like that ring! what is that? some kind of a....\" he interrupts and says, \"i don't know what it is.\" and she finishes her sentence by saying, \"tornado?\" then she adds, \"it looks like an alien ship.\" investigator's note: if a weather phenomenon had occurred, male witness would surely have recognized it as such, but instead, it appears to investigator trout that his comment, \"i don't know what it is.\" simply reflects puzzlement rather than recognition of ordinary clouds, as suggested later by a meteorologist. at this point, male witness' perception is that the sighting event has taken perhaps only a few seconds, or 2-3 minutes. (((please note: when the digital photos and the video were later examined, the times recorded led an iowa investigator, greg andersen, to surmise that the apparent time difference shows at least 23 minutes between the videotape and the last of the photos taken by the wife witness.))) male witness likens color of the disk to \"aluminum tinted by diesel smoke,\" and later he characterized the color as \"pewter.\" he says the ship looked darker than the haze generated around it, and that the center of the rings looked darker than the ship, although the ring edges looked grayish-silver. when the disk moved overhead, male witness could not see the eastern edge of the disk because of a treeline to his left (east) of his position. (((apparent size of disk when hovered 1\\2 mile away at 50 degrees yields size parameters of 1,405 to 2,054 feet..these size parameters are arrived at by using an apparent size of 20 degrees, and an apparent size of 30 degrees in a trigonometry program used by iowa mufon to arrive at an approximate size.))) neither husband nor wife thought to look for the western edge of the object. (this seems somewhat understandable, since they specify its great size as it hovered so low overhead.) in the backyard, male witness took his eyes off the disk to look briefly north toward the house, and when he turned again to face south, the disk and the haze quickly dissolved\\blinked out, and the object was gone. see investigator notes for investigation conclusion."],"Case Number":"27976"}
