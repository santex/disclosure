I was sitting in my room and looked at the sky, a few seconds later I saw a white(ish) circle-shaped object moving quite fast. Can't really say how fast and how far away it was... It took it approx. 10-12 seconds to disappear behind a building. Unfortunately I was too slow to take a picture. BUT! A few minutes later I saw a similar object moving in the same direction. This time I took my camera and took 2 pics. It is very small. At first I thought it was a helicopter but I think it was too fast and it doesn't really look like one. Definitely doesn't look like a plane, does it? I think it might be a bird but I'm sending two pics to you just in case. Sorry the pics are so big but thanks to that you can see that object more clearly."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"White circle-shaped object(s)","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around May 28th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"05/28/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.047376","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"GB-05292010-0004","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Longitude":"-76.297614","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23512_submitter_file1__ufo1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23512_submitter_file2__ufo2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23512.html"]}
