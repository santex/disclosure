{"Date Submitted":"07/05/2011 04:03 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were watching the neighborhood fireworks when I looked over to the south - east and saw one or two BRIGHT (brighter than any plane or helicopter) lights coming over the horizon. I told my dad who was also outside \"look, UFOs!\" he walked over to take a look and we both realized that one, they WERE UFOs, and two, we could see more approaching. I started filming (I'll attach the video) and you can see the rest of what happens there. We have concluded that these craft were not likely to be Chinese Lanterns because of their overwhelming brightness while at a great distance and altitude and their ability to stay in formation with each other and all go off at the same time. There were also HUNDREDS of spectators that saw a triangular formation in a town nearby (about 14 miles away)."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07052011-0020","Latitude":"42.353355","Case Number":"29968","Summary":"6 orange balls of light move in formation","Longitude":"-88.093414","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Round Lake","There were no other sightings in Round Lake on or around July 4th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.353355,+-88.093414(29968)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29968) map </A>","Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Round Lake","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29968.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29968.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
