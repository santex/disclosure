As the shower moved to the east and the sun appeared in the west a beautiful rainbow, spanning horizon to horizon appeared in the east. I took my camra and attemped to capture the beauty of that rainbow. When the photo was developed there was a UFO in the upper left corner of the picture. The photo was stored and forgotten. Recently I remembered the picture and decided to do some computer enhancment on it. I discovered there is an aura surrounding the object and it is leaving a streak in it's wake. Upon extreame magnifcation an opening or a light can be seen in the bottom of the object. If you can explain the object in the photo, please inform me.
