My aunt was taking pictures of the scenery and once we got home, I started to check them out, when I noticed something strange in one of the pictures. It looks like a rocket with 4 boosters, or something. The object is at the top right corner, and you have to zoom in, it may seem like a cloud from far away. We didn't notice this object while I was driving and she was taking pictures at all. I usually follow SciFi shows and UFO stuff, so I was screaming with joy when we had caught one, and of course my aunt isn't a UFO buff, so she was playing it down. That is, until she saw the picture. She said, and I quote \"Whoa..what is that?\" to wich I replied, \"Thats an unidentified flying object, a UFO.\" Can you please explain me what this is? I know the picture is a bit fuzzy, but you can see something there. Thank you!"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Utuado","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Cylinder","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"I was checking out the pictures we took in a trip, and saw this.
