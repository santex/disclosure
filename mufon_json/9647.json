The objects seem to be in the atmosphere but by their position they're totally in a field by themselves and ever day as soon as I turn my head up to them, there they are! I even asked a newspaper vendor and she answered to me sayin that she always seen them. I explained to her that they could be UFO's and she acknowledge that to me. This is very unusual because their position is on the south east part of the Tijuana Rio malls. And from the United States side you can see them very clearly from a park near by. I come to work and cross the border every day and this is what I encounter every day except for a few rainy days when there was cloud coverage. Latel I did not see the but I will check again tomorrow.I tried photo them but my camera a Hewlett Packard digital could not register them and the pictur is black."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.555556,+-117.047043(9647)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9647) map </A>","trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There were no other sightings in San Diego on or around January 24th 2008"],"Case Number":"9647","Log Number":"US-02202008-0003","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/24/2008 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9647.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9647.html"],"Weather Factors":"None, Light","Summary":"Twp diagonally selected star like inmovable objects","Latitude":"32.555556","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO"}
