{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI came outside shortly after 9pm, think there was a weird sound, quickly scanned around. Bright lights immediately caught my eye. Two very bright lights in line with each other, with just a little space between them. They were somewhat low in the sky & close to the mountain ridge, about the height of an airplane flying quite low but moving very fast. I would say the lights were bigger than an airplane's would be & there weren't any accompanying red or green lights visible. I did not see any outline of the object itself, but feel as though the lights may've been more rectangular in shape rather than as star's appearance & my guess of the craft's shape would have to be saucer or disk-like. There was no sound as a helicopter or airplane would have, and it darted over the mountain southward very fast. I felt startled, excited, and a little silly. Also wondered if others had seen it."],"Date Submitted":"10/19/2013 03:14 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-10192013-0007","Case Number":"51651","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"53.729668","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51651.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51651.html"],"trends":[],"Longitude":"-127.645111","Region":"British Columbia","Country":"Canada","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","Date of the Event":"10/16/2013 09:05 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Window(s)","Summary":"two star-like bright lights on an non-visible craft moving much faster than airplane zipping over mountain top","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.729668,+-127.645111(51651)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51651) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
