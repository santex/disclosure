There will be a need to perform an extensive and expensive excavation of the area. The Air Force has given the go ahead on letting a Civillian Find it and Excavate it. Now that I have invested a tremendous amount of my own money on finding the object I am interested in being hired to Excavate it for what ever company is interested in paying me to continue and finish my work.
