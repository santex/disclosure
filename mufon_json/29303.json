I observed the alignment of four planets in a diagonal formation and then noticed an arrow shaped object directly above me, reflecting light from the city. I had no idea what it was but thought it might be a kite, tethered. It occurred to me that it would have to be an enormous kite. It did not move and looked like a giant orange arrow with the pointed shape and the shaft not connected. It did not change direction or move. It was orange in color and stayed there for about 45 minutes, until I had to go home. Too high to be a kite unless it was one the size of a mini van. The object had very straight edges that did not change shape. I just felt confused, like observing an optical illusion. It was definitely an object and not an illusion or cloud or smoke or reflection."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-93.257196","Region":"Minnesota","Summary":"Arrow shaped, like a teathered kite but way up high.","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.982545,+-93.257196(29303)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29303) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Minneapolis","There were no other sightings in Minneapolis on or around May 12th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"05/12/2011 12:00 UTC"}
