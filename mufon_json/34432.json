I noticed two orange spheres rise over the city, in the distance. They rose together in unison, not breaking their distance apart. The top one went stationary, while the bottom one swung around it some 45 degrees, not departing from the same distance apart. The top one faded out, followed immediately by the bottom one. It was witnessed by myself and another in our group, clearly. I have found other reports, online, of exactly this type of sighting in our area, around the same time, but not the same night."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-12312011-0016","Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"12/31/2011 04:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34432.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34432.html"],"Latitude":"44.054789","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"2 orange spheres over City of Eugene","Case Number":"34432","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.054789,+-123.083054(34432)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34432) map </A>","Longitude":"-123.083054"}
