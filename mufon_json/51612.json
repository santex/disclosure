It was moving rather slow, and I was trying to figure out what I was looking at, when it changed direction abruptly and came north just briefly before it went straight up into the sky and disappeared. I could not tell what shape it was, it was just a brilliant white light with a greenish cast to the edges. I could not believe my eyes and was scared because I couldn't make sense of it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
