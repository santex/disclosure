It was just above the tops of the buildings. I think about 20 degrees above the horizon. There are lots of builing a long there so it was only visable for a few seconds. Shortly there after a dark colored jet, probably military, went by heading in the same direction as the disc but not neerly as fast. The disc was only visable for one or two seconds. The disc appered to be very shiney like alumanum foil but with texture like it was crumpled up then flatoned out again. I asked if she would like to talk to one of y'all about this but she said it would make her feel weird. I don't think Bill Birnes will show up to talk to her but you never know. So this is second hand."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"27.513327","Date of the Event":"08/09/2008 05:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.513327,+-99.506142(12016)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12016) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"12016","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08102008-0011","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
