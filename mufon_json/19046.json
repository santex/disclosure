I watched it start to drop slightly then it went to the left behind the trees, and I lost site of it. At about 10:30 PM. Then I came back out with my husband to see if we could see it again, and this time there was a white light that was moving West toward Charleston WV, and this time it just disapeared into the mist. I have seen many objects in this area, and in my opinion they need to look into WV for a hot spot for UFS's."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19046.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19046.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering","Summary":"Circular, red, and white rotating lights","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09022009-0017","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around September 1st 2009"],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2009 06:27 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date of the Event":"09/01/2009 11:05 UTC"}
