{"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Wellington","Tags":"City","Case Number":"13362","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my living room watching TV when I caught something out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to look out the window I saw a glowing green light desend from the top left corner of the window and disappear behind the neighbors house. It fell towards the ground like a meteor would. I instantly jumped up to look out the window, and saw nothing. From the time it appeared in the upper left corner of the window to the time it disappeared was only about 3-4 secs. We have a see-through honeycomb shade that was down so I couldn't tell the distance or how large it was. The size of light that I saw was about the same size as the street light on the street behind my house, so about 4-5 inches in diameter. If it was far in the distance, it was pretty big. I am doing this to see if anyone else saw anything, because I am not sure what it could of been."],"Date of the Event":"10/28/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Glowing lime green oval shaped object seen","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.709891","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13362.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13362.html"],"Region":"Colorado","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Wellington","There were no other sightings in Wellington on or around October 28th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.709891,+-105.000216(13362)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13362) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10292008-0023","Date Submitted":"10/28/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-105.000216","Disposition":"IFO"}
