(to dispute the obvious, there weren't and still aren't that many cop cars in all of ness county, and why would they be parked in a circle, off a dirt road, in a pasture?). i observed these red flashing lights for several minutes, through the front glass of the tractor, until i came to a corner and turned east, then i observed the same thing in the same place out the side glass, as i was driving parallel to it. it did not appear to move, other than the flashing of the lights, and i could not see any solid object, as it was nearly dark, all i could see was the lights. i continued to watch until i went over a rise and drove out of view. as i went around back to the north end of the field, my father was there to relieve me, and of course i told him what i had seen, and where. we were out of view of the farmstead at this time, and i can't remember if we had to fuel the tractor or how long we were stopped there, but after some time, he took off in the tractor and i proceded to the road. when i got to the road, i had the choice of going south and driving to within 100 yards (from the road) of what i saw, or going north and going home.....i went north, FAST. i was very frightened and feared for my life. i asked my dad the next day if he saw anything, and the answer was no. i never returned to the location of the lights to see if i could spot imprints, scorch marks, etc., partly out of fear, ignorance of trace evidence, and assuming that since my dad didn't see anything, it probably wasn't there anymore. i am telling this story now, because of the program i saw about trace evidence, and maybe some of this evidence could still be there, after all these years. i believe i can accurately estimate the location of what i saw because the trees are still there. if you would like to persue this, or would like more information, i would be happy to help. although i was raised in a rural setting, i have a b.s. degree in earth science and have been an air traffic controller for the past 20 years. thank you for your time."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8481.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8481.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.444461,+-100.194855(8481)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8481) map </A>","Latitude":"38.444461","Region":"Kansas","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11272007-0001","Date of the Event":"06/30/1973 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States"}
