{"Log Number":"US-05082010-0012","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy fiancee first noticed the light when she looked out the window after some love-making. She thought that it was a star and asked me if she was crazy or was the star moving. She said that it seemed too bright for a star and that it had a blue light which was moving from top to bottom of the object. The first thing that came to my mind was a star. I couldn't focus on it at first and didn't see the same blue light. To me it looked like a star until we noticed that it was moving from side to side and up and down. Then I noticed that it seemed to be shining a light at the clouds as if searching for something. Both of us were kind of freaked, not being sure if it might be a u.f.o. or if we were just imagining things. After a few seconds of the light scanning the clouds, whatever it was just disappeared and we didn't see it again. Were sure the clouds didn't obscure it because they were too sparse and it never fully drifted behind the clouds before disappearing."],"Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"05/06/2010 11:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Looked like a star, but had lights that moved from top to bottom.
