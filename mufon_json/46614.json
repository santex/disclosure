{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"04/05/2013 09:15 UTC","Region":"North Carolina","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is the most recent of 4 sightings in Raleigh for me, but the second sighting in the past 2 weeks in which both my twin and I have witnessed. We went on a late walk around 8:30 and cut through Sanderson High schools parking lot. As we were cutting through the fire alarm went off, and as we kept walking I anticipated the cops showing up. So we decided to go through the woods to avoid questioning, and we got back on the street . We we're going up the sidewalk and we began to hear a loud motor sound, in which I immediately diagnosed as a helicopter. A few seconds later it was extremely loud so I said \"That doesnt sound like a weather helicopter\" and my twin agreed . We saw it flashing through the trees and it was flashing red so we waited for it to get over the treeline to see what it was . It happened so quick but basically as the helicopter came over the trees i spotted a white starlike object flying consistently in front of it . I yelled at my brother \"DO YOU SEE THAT WHITE LIGHT ?\" he said yes and we ran across the street as it went back over the trees and i could still see the helicopter flying behind this object . So not only did I get a side view, I got an angled view . I immediately called family and thought about posting on mufon, but then decided it would be tedious . I then realized if nobody ever reports these things, who knows man . I never though NC was a hotspot , but if someone could contact me I have some really good information .
