{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home after classes at URI due west: took south road cut-through to get to 102 from route 1 and after slowing down greatly to take the turn in the light rain. it crossed perpendicular and I only had clear view for maybe 7-10 seconds and it was visible for maybe 30-45 seconds. Flying extremely low and almost overhead was a disc shaped object that I confidently made out due to the pulsing light. every other second it seemed it lit up the neasrestsky in a circular radius to a dark shade of electric blue. It had 3 lights in a V shape pointing forward and was tailed a few hundred meters behind by a large plane at the same altitude. too dark to get any more details."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.455819","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in South Kingstown","There were no other sightings in South Kingstown on or around February 16th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"02/16/2012 08:52 UTC","Date of the Event":"02/16/2012 06:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"South Kingstown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.455819,+-71.518427(35857)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35857) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"35857","Log Number":"US-02162012-0016","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-71.518427","Country":"United States","Region":"Rhode Island","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35857.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35857.html"],"Summary":"black disc, 3 red/yellow lights in a v pointing forwatd, pulsating blue"}
