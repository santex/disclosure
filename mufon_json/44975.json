A fireball appeared from behind a 20 foot maple tree which is about 15 feet from my deck. it was travelling from left to right and I thought at first it was a meteor, except that it was moving S to N parallel to the ground. It was a large yellow-orange fireballl with a flame and trail. It moved more slowly than a meteor, but was out of sight within 20 seconds, continuing north without an arc toward earth. My deck is elevated about 12 feet above the ground, so it felt very close. After it passed, the hair on my arms stood up. I stayed outside for about 15 more minutes, but saw nothing more.
