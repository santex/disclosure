{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-107.598112","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at my home in La Plata County Colorado last night, (June 1, 2007) when I woke up and went to get a glass of water at approximately 11:30 pm. I glanced out the kitchen window and noticed a very large, bright white light to the west. At first I thought maybe it was a hot air balloon.... but why would it be so lit up and out flying at 11:30 at night. I stepped out on porch and the object appeared to be standing still in the sky and about the size of my thumbnail at arms length. Quite large. At times it apeared spherical and at other times eliptical or oval in shape. I was able to go grab the binoculars and when I observed the object through the binoculars, I then could see that it was covered with many bright white lights. There were spaces between the lights. The lights were steady. It now appeared that the object was moving slowly away from me. I observed it for approximately 30 minutes. My wife saw it also. Then suddenly it just dissapeared."],"City":"Bayfield","Date of the Event":"06/01/2007 11:30 UTC","Case Number":"7134","Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.225559,+-107.598112(7134)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7134) map </A>","Latitude":"37.225559","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Unknown","Log Number":"US-06022007-0004","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"sherical or eliptical object covered with lights moving slowly WNW direction","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7134.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7134.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bayfield","There were no other sightings in Bayfield on or around June 1st 2007"],"Date Submitted":"06/01/2007 11:30 UTC","Country":"United States"}
