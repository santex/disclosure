It was a set of four lights, one on each side (top, bottom, left and right). It was hovering around in a zig-zag pattern, and while it was doing this it was making a sort of sound like \"looooooo\". The two lights on the sides were white, while the top and bottom ones were flashing colors of green, blue, purple, yellow and white. I saw this at around 8:40 PM EST."],"Log Number":"","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/20/2005 02:12 UTC","Longitude":"-73.864206","Case Number":"3365","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 2 other sightings in New York on or around March 20th 2005"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.85681,+-73.864206(3365)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3365) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.85681","Region":"New York","Summary":"Not Provided","City":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/20/2005 02:12 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
