I was at a peer sitting with a friend talking 2. I saw bright green out of the corner of my eye then turned to watch the UFO for a couple seconds 3. It looked like a possible craft within a bright lime-green light surrounding half of the perimeter 4. Two objects flew across the sky at a slight angle until they disappeared behind the trees, Very bright, lime green perimeter, no sound, hard to tell if there was a ship or not but inside of the light it looked black so I think there was. Moved from left to right, the light was on the right side of each. 5. Very surprised, I was in awe. Very cool though. 6. Went behind trees and I lost sight."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
