I could tell it was very far away, as it was barely visible with the naked eye. I tracked it heading east at an apparently very high speed, but not too fast for me to keep up. It got dimmer as it traveled to my left, until it disappeared from even my view in the binoculars. It's possible this was a satellite, as it only traveled in a straight line, and did not move around or make any unexpected maneuvers. The only thing I saw strange about it was how, to my perspective, it seemed to be getting farther away from me, as if it was moving further out into space. Normally when I see a satellite, I can watch it over a larger portion of the sky before it disappears. It was just a dim point of light, no pulsing or flashing or anything. About 45 degrees up from horizon."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Centennial","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15254","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
