(this is an estimate only), but along it���������s path, it jumped left, then right, then up and then down, headed down, then up and kind of jumped all around. what really helped me at that point was there were two other aircraft (seemed to be interested in this craft, possibly following i don���������t know for sure), they were comparatively very steady, the lights all were where they should be, not jumping around, and the trajectory was a normal aircraft with nothing remarkable in any way. when i compared them, (now behind this vehicle by a few miles but seemed to be closing in slightly), this thing was obviously all over the place. then i got a little better look at it, and what i was able to make out, was that the colored lights were following a triangle shape. the shape was dark black, even more so than the background sky, the lights were in a triangle shape, meaning it appeared they followed the trim of the aircraft, and one bright white light underneath. comparatively to the other two normal aircraft, it had to be a few hundred feet wide easily, and that is very conservative. even the strobing colored lights were 10 times as bright as the other two aircraft in the same trajectory. again, following the trees, the electrical lines, the two rear aircraft were very steady, but the aircraft out front, was very large and jumping all around while the other two were as steady as any other aircraft you watch fly across the sky. so, what do i believe it was, i truly don���������t know, but, in the short time i had to watch, and the fact, it covered it���������s distance to out of sight, from the moment i first saw it, was about 1 to 1.5 minutes. but it was a few minutes i won���������t soon forget. by the way, my partner [b] and i would still like to become investigators. we were also trained through fema, and the red cross. i am also a tv producer, once in a while, but this has nothing to do with that. in fact, i prefer to keep it separate. however, in the field, investigating, it would be a very useful tool.
