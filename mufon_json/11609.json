Way too fast to be a jet or helicopter","divs":["sighting detailsi was sitting in my living room, reading a magazine when suddenly i saw a bright white\\blue light traveling very rapidly across the sky, about 40 degrees above the horizon.it was so bright, it was easy to spot at attracted my attention right away. i saw it out a three huge windows totaling about 15 feet wide and 8 feet tall, where i can see a large part of the night sky. it was quiet in the house, and there was no noise made at all by this object, which appeared to be about a quarter mile away. it was going so fast, i've never seen a plane travel at that rate before. at first, i thought it was a firefly, but it was far too bright and going much faster than any firefly could move. it only took a few seconds for it to cross completely across my field of view. it moved straight across without stopping."],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"43.228617","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Germantown","There were no other sightings in Germantown on or around July 17th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Wisconsin","Log Number":"US-07172008-0009","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11609.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/17/2008 01:04 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.228617,+-88.110369(11609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11609) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Germantown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"07/17/2008 01:04 UTC"}
