What made me notice it was because it was so bright and lower then all the stars. I looked around and saw airplanes passing it and it was the same level of the planes so I knew it was lower than a star. It was blinking red and white. I told my co worker to come outside and was like is that a star. She saw it and said no that's too low for a star that's a plane then I said but its not moving she said your right and called our other co worker out who said the same thing. They wnt inside cause they got freaked out. This happened around 735pm. I stayed outside watching it. It was blinking red and white slow and before it flew up and disappeared it was flashing red really fast. It shot up so fast I lost sight. My feelings with this was I was shocked and amazed. I was thinking is this really what I'm seeing. It freaked me out after it disappeared"]}
