They were next to each other. The first thing I thought of was UFO. I have not seen anything like this before. Unless the neighbors were shooting something into the sky which is not likely. Anyway, the lights were moving it the sky. As I pulled up to my driveway I looked behind me as I pulled in and saw another light and it faded into the sky very slowly in the same spot. Then about 3 minutes later, I saw the same type of orange light and it looked like it came from the ground and proceeded to go higher in the sky and just slowly went higher in the sky and then disappeared again. I heard no fireworks blowing off or any sounds at all that resembled fire works. I believe that this lights could have been UFO."],"Case Number":"35948","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Slightly orange round lights moving in the sky.","Log Number":"US-02202012-0007","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35948.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35948.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/24/2011 07:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Clarks Green","Latitude":"41.500258","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Clarks Green","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
