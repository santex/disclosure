I saw an object in the sky and i thought it was a metero shower. When the object moved to thin clouds close by the outter shape became more apparent a thin white on the outter edge of it, also a yellow Y-shape down the center which had a pale yellow color. The object just moved at a steady place into the clouds about 500 feet above my head. The ufo disappered into the clouds. During this event i could not believe what i was seeing. After i relized what it was i was excited to see this incredible experience."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.25001,+-76.993809(10022)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10022) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10022.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10022_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10022.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10022.html"],"Log Number":"US-03232008-0009","Summary":"Figure eight shaped, with point at each end, thin light around the other edge of ufo","Date Submitted":"03/23/2008 09:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Insignia","Tags":"City"}
