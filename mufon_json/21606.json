At the time this was the outskirts of Tucson and it was dark and quiet in the area. I thought it was a search light from a hovering helicopter until I noticed that there was no sound but the light continued to move in my direction. The light eventually stopped roughly 200-300 feet away. The light remained in this position for 30-45 seconds, no movement just sitting in the same position. It suddenly excellerated straight up and disappeared in to the darkness. My heart was racing and the image has been burned in to mind ever since that day. I remember that I never noticed a sound nor did I ever see a distinct shape besides the white light, it was star-like in apperance."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Arizona"}
