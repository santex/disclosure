I looked up and saw what I thought at first was a Military Aircraft because it was Black and Triangular shaped. It did not travel very fast for the military craft i thought it was. As i kept watching it, its shape started to shift. I thought maybe it was a bird or perhaps a balloon but it was way too high and then it turned around and headed the opposite direction. It sped up just a bit and took a black sphere form kept going in one direction then headed higher and stopped. It was hovering there for five minutes as I watched. The whole event lasted about 8 to ten minutes and then my bus came and I lost sight of it. This left me feeling uneasy beacause it was so clear."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.747853","Date Submitted":"01/07/2011 03:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Santa Ana","There were no other sightings in Santa Ana on or around January 7th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01072011-0008"}
