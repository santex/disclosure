{"Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving east bound on highway 78, I had just past under the over pass Rancho Santa Fe. in San Marcos. When I noticed something off to my left in the night sky . The lights were so bite they seemed like car head lights, 4 of them and 1 little red on the left and 1 blue on the rightside then I noticed first that it was very low and if it had been an airplane it was way to low but then I noted that there was no blinking lights as an airplane should be, if that is what it was. Next there was no noise and because I was driving on 78 in the fast lane trying to see this object, but keeping my eye on the road, I also noticed that there was a car in the emergency (inside) lane stopped. I am not sure if they stopped to view this object also or what, but it did look like, as I past the car, that their car looked ok. By this time I was driving under the overpass street of ���Twin Oaks��� and I lost site of the object and couldn���t see it behind me. but i wanted to go back just to make sure it was what I thought it was but i was late picking up my son and boyfriend, I just kept driving asking myself what the Flock was that, what did I just see? and I am still wondering if anyone else saw this too in San Marcos"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14555.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14555.html"],"City":"Escondido","Weather Factors":"Rain, Light","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.128727,+-117.081951(14555)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14555) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"4 brite lites in front flying slow & very low.
