Well then I thought to my self it's a nice warm night I'm going to take a walk down the street to visit a friend because I know he would be up late as I started walking I felt like I was being fallowed as strange as it seem I looked up in to the sky and noticed star like orb the very one that I have been seeing now for quite some time since the summer of 2008 as I would look up into the night sky I would see it moving really slowly and then stopping and becoming dim like as if it didn't want me to see it so as I started walking a little more this star like object or orb would brighten up and fallow me more I ran to my friend's house and knocked on his screen door and as he came out the door the star like orb disappeared if any one would like to question me on this please contact me at wright10301973@gmail.com I now know for sure that it was no satellite in fact this orb also turned as I was watching it and had no noise to it what so ever at first I thought maybe my eye's are playing tricks on me but I watched it long enough that it was moving and it was no satellite I'm writing this statement out of all God's honest truth of what I seen just hope not to get Abducted after this experience"],"Date of the Event":"06/05/2009 11:53 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-76.78577","Case Number":"17873","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17873.html"],"Latitude":"40.865445","Country":"United States","City":"Sunbury","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Sunbury","There were no other sightings in Sunbury on or around June 5th 2009"],"Summary":"UFO STAR LIKE OBJECT FALLOWED ME FOR LIKE A BLOCK AWAY FROM MY HOUSE !","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"06/05/2009 11:53 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
