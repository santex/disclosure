(the air force jet seemed as if to discourage them from hovering any lower?) some of the lights seemed to appear and disappear randomly. one red light(orb) was constant and much lower and closer to me, appearing larger. it was glowing bright reddish\\orange toward the center. there's a strange\\interesting intuitive aspect to my experience as well. i felt there was some kind of connection\\communication through telepathy... very difficult to explain. i was in a state of shock and amazement, i guess you could say. i didn't think to grab a camera. i didn't even watch to see how long they were all out there. i didn't feel afraid, but it did take a while to process the experience. it was very positive actually, and deeply profound. it gave me lots to think about. they looked just like other star-like\\orb\\lights i've now seen on youtube from sightings all over the world. wow... there really is something to this whole \"ufo\" thing. definitely worth investigating further... much to learn with all of this."],"Latitude":"39.749014","Region":"Colorado","Disposition":"Hoax","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Date Submitted":"04/10/2010 03:36 UTC","Log Number":"US-04102010-0002","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"22743","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around March 6th 2010"],"Summary":"Large cluster of white and a few reddish/orange lights, Air Force jet circling","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-104.977263","Weather Factors":"None"}
