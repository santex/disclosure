{"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"19904","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like","Longitude":"-94.158116","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was leaving home when something to the west caught my eye. I stopped my car at the end of the driveway and saw a larger star-like object that was further down than the rest of the stars. I could see atleast six other objects of light going around it, then disappearing further off into the distance. I ran inside to get the camcorder and when I came out I could still see the main object. I caught three other flashes of lights coming towards it then quickly disappear. The last object, however, went towards the main object and got level with it and was flashing red, blue and white, it then went up and to the left and they both disappeared and I didn't see them again after that. I was so scared (and cold) that it was hard for me to keep the camera still. In the beginning of the video it appears that the object moved, but it was me moving the camera up to see if I could see the stars."],"Log Number":"US-10112009-0016","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19904.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19904.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Fort Dodge","There were no other sightings in Fort Dodge on or around October 10th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Flashing lights","Date of the Event":"10/10/2009 08:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.501449,+-94.158116(19904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19904) map </A>","City":"Fort Dodge","Latitude":"42.501449","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/11/2009 11:25 UTC","Region":"Iowa","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None"}
