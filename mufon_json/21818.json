I was called out side to see and orange ball which at first I thought was just another lantern. but this thing was moving south to north and the it stopped above us and was rotating left and right. it then shot out to sea within seconds. then further down the coast it came back and towards us before shooting straight up out of sight. I had a standard 5 mp camera with no night feature but in this event started snapping away hoping to capture a small glimpse of what this might be, however when I put these pictures on my pc all I got was a green static screen except for one great picture."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Leeds","There were no other sightings in Leeds on or around June 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Leeds","Log Number":"GB-02082010-0007","Summary":"a moving orange ball","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21818.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21818_submitter_file1__007.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21818_submitter_file2__bigufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21818.html"],"Latitude":"53.802769","Longitude":"-1.539567","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
