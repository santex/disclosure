I am taking this method of contact due to the fact that I am very disappointed to find that Stan Friedman's phone has no more space for leaving messages, and I am not confident that I actually have his e-mail address. I am watching the hearing on disclosure on streamer, and a question arose just now, regarding \"If there is anyone still alive who actually saw a body at the Roswell incident. I am well acquainted with a woman who was at the site because her son was stationed there with the air force. I have known her for many years, and have no reason to believe she is lying or that she imagined this. If Mr. Friedman could contact me, I will be glad to share what I know about this person and what she shared with me. I do not want to provide details at this time as not of consequence."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47101.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47101.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05012013-0009","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"04/05/2013 12:00 UTC","City":"Undisclosed"}
