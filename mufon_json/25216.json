But I saw a similar report in Oregon which isn't far from me. So i will report mine and you can decide. I was watching an airplane on my way to the day care to pick daughter up, and then I saw a very bright light which was about 30 degrees above horizon in the distance that shot up to 45 or 50 degrees and then disappeared. The event lasted only 2-3 seconds but it was moving very fast. I couldn't not notice it, that's how bright it was. Maybe the size of a tennis ball from where i was. And It couldn't be a meteorite because I've seen them before and they don't go up in the sky. Maybe it was some rocket i don't know."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Very bright light shoot up in the sky at 45 degrees from horizon.","Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around August 25th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"08/25/2010 04:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","City":"Seattle","Object Shape":"Flash","Weather Factors":"None"}
