It looked about 1000ft or so in the air and seemed to be floating in an easterly direction. The orange ball of light lasted for about 3 minutes and then disappeared. Both of my kids were witnessed this event. Then in the east side of town, two more orange orbs of light about the same height appeared in the sky and were headed west and seemed to be floating. At first I thought it was a meteor shower but after seeing 7 of these lights total within an hour, I concluded that they may have been flares but not 100% sure. Each time the orange orbs of light disappeared in about 3 to 5 minutes."],"Summary":"4Th of July surprise.","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Latitude":"48.056954","Case Number":"17831","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 10:15 UTC","Longitude":"-122.172112","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Marysville"}
