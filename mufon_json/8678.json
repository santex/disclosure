I was standing on Carroll Street in Brooklyn NY where it intersects with 5th avenue. The object was heading in about the same direction as Carroll Street when looking towards Prospect Park. The object was a white ball above the clouds as my view would be lost as it passed above the clouds. The obsevation lasted about 20 seconds in which time the object moved from overhead to the limit of my horizon. The object was very high and no shape was observable. There was no contrail. I was very accustomed to seeing aircraft over NYC and this was nothing like that in terms of speed. I have military experience and have taken flying lessons as well. I called public relations at NASA afterwards to ask if it could be the space station or another artificial object but they said nothing would be viewable during the day and \"I suggest you call the Air Force\". The year indicated may be plus or minus one. Should have reported it to you folks earlier."],"Date Submitted":"05/31/2002 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around May 31st 2002"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"White ball high above cloud cover moving at enormous speed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/31/2002 12:00 UTC","Region":"New York","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8678.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8678.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12252007-0010","Case Number":"8678","Longitude":"-73.999043","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"40.717883","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
