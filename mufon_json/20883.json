But I got it figured out where I could at least film it 23 minutes until it went behind the mountain--the video is high quality although I need to get a tripod today because it is difficult to hold my arms still. The Pictures I snapped are not good. My girlfriend grabbed the binoculars and also saw it. The video is 2 gigs and too large to upload. This is the second night in a row I saw and filmed this at approximately the same time. The photos are not a good quality like the film, but show a very bright object in the sky."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.055048,+-111.088021(20883)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20883) map </A>","trends":[""],"Log Number":"US-12052009-0004","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20883.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20883_submitter_file1__IMG_1383.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20883_submitter_file2__IMG_1384.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20883.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle"}
