My father was driving and I was in the passenger���s seat. In the back seat of the Truck was my mom and my three Kids age 10, 4, and 2. I was looking at a radio tower that was blinking off in the distance. When all of a sudden 3 amber colored lights came on in a horizontal row. I asked my Dad what the hell it was, to which he said��� it���s the UFO. He pulled the truck to the side of the road. By this time there were 6 amber lights all in row. With an additional 3 down to the left side below the 6 original lights. The light appeared to move and change quickly. My father stepped out of the truck to see if he could hear anything and it was silent. And then they were gone. I would say these light where unlike anything I have ever seen. I posted what happened that night on my face book page. A friend of mine blogged back that she had gotten a text message from a friend at 7:40 pm say she had seen what she described was what my family and I saw."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Stephenville","Log Number":"US-02062009-0016","Summary":"Saw 3 amber colored lights in horizontal shape, then it suddenly turned to 6 with three lights below it to the left.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 3 other sightings in Stephenville on or around February 6th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"02/06/2009 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"15351"}
