I noticed that I didnt see any wings so I got my binoculars. The craft did not have any visible wings, it was silver and was about as long as a 747 jet, it also left no smoke trail or did not make noise. It was traveling approximately as fast as a jet would. The weirdest thing about it was that about 3-5 minutes later I noticed a jet coming through very close to the same flight path. I could see that it was a jet because it left a very visible smoke trail. The really weird thing is that the jet was accompanied by another one of these same objects! they seem to be flying together. I wanted to report it but i didnt know who to call. I wasnt sure if it might have been a space shuttle because I know the wings on them are quite smaller but when I went to the nasa site I didnt see any planned activity listed for that day. I just wondered if you might know what this could have been. I have 3 witnesses who seen it."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.885692,+-78.016513(21087)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21087) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.016513","trends":["There has been one other sighting in pavilion","There were no other sightings in pavilion on or around November 3rd 2009"],"Case Number":"21087","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.885692","Tags":"City","Summary":"Object spotted with no wings","City":"pavilion","Sighting Duration":"00:15:10","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21087.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21087.html"],"Country":"United States"}
