It looked like a star but was much brighter and larger than any other star in the sky. About ten minutes later we arrived back at his house and went over his neighbors house to sit on the front porch. Our friends were also watching the light wondering what it was when we got there. It was about thirty minutes later that the light slowly started to go lower. As it went lower it would also become less bright and smaller. As the object was just above the tree line it started letting off small orbs of lights that lit up the top of the trees. Then out of no where the object disappeared without a trace."],"Summary":"Extremely bright light high in the sky that slowly lowered itself letting off orbs of lights and disappeared.","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Brick","There were no other sightings in Brick on or around June 28th 2010"],"Region":"New Jersey","Date Submitted":"06/28/2010 11:49 UTC","Latitude":"40.059636","Country":"United States"}
