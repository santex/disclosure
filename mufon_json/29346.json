P. S. Worldport ramp 9 spot 29 location, my attention was drawn to a departing commercial flight taking off nearby.. The moment I looked up I noticed a dark object passing directly overhead.. Traveling northeast at a slow speed.. The object was completely dark with a bright solid light at the rear.. This object didn't have any noticeable FAA required becon lights and didn't match the appearance of an aircraft circling because of a missed approach.. It continued on a northeast course till I lost sight.. It should be stated I have over 26 years experience working around aircraft and have witnessed arriving and departing aircraft numerous time.. What concerns me most is just how close this object was to the departing flight at take off.."]}
