{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailsjuly 4th party saw someone point to the sky. turned to look saw what I first thougt was a rocket launching. The funny thing was there was no fire tail or con trail & it was in the western sky. Rockets launch in the east. I turned my camera to it for about 30sec. then dismissed it as I don't know what. With camera running I walked over to people who also were watching it. They did not know what it was either. Someone said UFO I laughed & spun my camera back to the light. It appeared stationary still. I then turned my attention back to the fireworks. Later everyone I showed the video to said UFO. I am a professional cameraman & have lived in florida for over 30 years. I do not know what I saw but it was definatly unusual."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24481.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24481.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/13/2010 11:35 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.884224,+-81.310995(24481)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24481) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07132010-0009","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24481","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"28.884224","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Fire ball rising & hovering in western sky.","City":"De Bary","Longitude":"-81.310995","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in De Bary","There were no other sightings in De Bary on or around July 4th 2010"],"Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Fireball"}
