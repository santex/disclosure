I tried going back to sleep but was restless. I finally fell back to sleep when I had a feeling of being held down. It was around 5:45am which is 15 minutes earlier than I usually wake up during the week. I was trying to wake up but I couldn't, I started kicking slowly and tried opening my eyes. I tried screaming but could not make any noise. After kicking harder I started opening my eyes and noticed that my hand were being help against my chest by a being that was standing on the left of my bed.
