{"Tags":"City","trends":[],"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is not a UFO report and I have never seen one. I am a UFO junkie and I have an idea for a show and a very good question. There is a wide range of UFO's that are reported on UFO shows of numerous different shapes, sizes, configurations. I have not seen a show that explores the possibility that we are being visited or watched by numerous alien species. If we can agree that we are not the only evolved species then perhaps there are dozens of different species from different parts of the universe visiting us. What else would explain the wide variation of UFO vehicle reports? Thats all folks, Robert Campisi"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26246.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26246.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"26246","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10312010-0012","Country":"United States","Latitude":"27.668367","Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"NO report just trying to get my thought to MUFON.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.668367,+-81.505964(26246)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26246) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.505964","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/31/2010 04:17 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","City":"Undisclosed"}
