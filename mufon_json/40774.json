We were about 60 miles from Phoenix when at 4:19am I observed an object with between 6-8 white lights horizontally aligned and about 45 feet above I-10 coming directly at me. It was about 100 yards ahead of me. I at first thought it was an overpass but quickly observed it moving directly toward me. I asked my wife \"what is that\" and when it was about 20 feet in front of me it made an almost 90 degree turn to my left and went toward a plowed field. I asked my wife to follow it but she said it had disapeared. For a few minutes I thought it was an airplane. Then I realized there was absolutely no sound."],"Case Number":"40774","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"07/13/2012 10:30 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Phoenix","Country":"United States","Summary":"horizontal lights (6-8) about 45 ' off ground over I-10","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON"}
