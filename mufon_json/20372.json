She made a remark about them, to which I in turned remarked that there were many, many stars that could be pointed out into a triangle. The stars were in front of our view, so I watched them without much thought. I then noticed the stars were not in a triangle any longer, but the middle star which made up the left point of the triangle was now in the center of the other two stars, making a straight line. As we continued on our drive, we began to realize that the object was not a star at all. It's coloration was akin to that of Mars, however we drove closer to it rather than it staying in the backdrop. The object did not flash in any sequence (as airplanes are required to do) and it was too high to be the top of a cellular tower. The object did not seem to move in any direction, after it's initial movement, but remained stationary in the sky as we past to the west of it."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","City":"Sunnyside","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"11/06/2009 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sunnyside","There were no other sightings in Sunnyside on or around November 6th 2009"],"Region":"Washington","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-120.003854","Case Number":"20372","Date Submitted":"11/07/2009 11:43 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.329942,+-120.003854(20372)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20372) map </A>","Summary":"Red light seen in sky, clearly not a star.","Log Number":"US-11072009-0021","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Latitude":"46.329942"}
