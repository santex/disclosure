(my parents thought it would have been visible to a great many people, since it was such a clear sunset...and quite a population in western washington who have access, if they care to look, at the olympics...from olympia, lakewood, tacoma, seattle, and everett, etc.)"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Olympia","There were no other sightings in Olympia on or around June 4th 2011"],"Summary":"Hovering cigar shaped object with long, thin tail over Olympic Mountains","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"29404","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar"}
