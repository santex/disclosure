Out of the corner of my eye to my left I see a beautiful light blue sphere, like a crystal ball, descending but very close to be traveling horizontally. It was traveling south to north. It was a beautiful color blue, vivid, and a light blue tail followed behind it that looked like a blur of the sphere, tail was part of a glow that followed behind it same distance as it moved across the sky. There was the sphere that looked to be about 25' across and the trail of light had a length of about 250 feet. It was silent, traveled very, very fast. Lost view of it atop the tree line. Big, beautiful crystal ball slightly transparent. Unforgettable, awesome, and impressive. It was witnessed by myself and one other co-worker facing that direction."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"12/15/2011 05:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Ashburn","Object Features":"None"}
