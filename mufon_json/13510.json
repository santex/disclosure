It was extraordinarily bright and no beacons could be seen. I saw it while driving east from downtown Tampa towards Lakeland. At the time it would have been located over eastern Tampa and it did not appear that it was moving very fast. Unfortunately, since I was driving, I had to keep my eye on the road and could not study it further."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.958255,+-82.450178(13510)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13510) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"11/03/2008 06:30 UTC","City":"Tampa","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.450178","Log Number":"US-11032008-0025","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13510.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13510.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/03/2008 06:30 UTC"}
