At first they seemed to be either slowly moving toward my location or slowly climbing up. They seemed to float there for a short time Thought at first they could be balloons with flares attached. The higher one would begin to go higher and the lower one would follow. they began to climb faster the highest one went straight up accelerating out of sight the lower one followed but continued to climb in a northerly direction I did not lose sight of the second one until it was overhead and to the north seemed to be at a very high altitude by this time and moving at a very hi rate of speed did not hear any sound."],"Longitude":"-83.027703","Date Submitted":"05/28/2012 09:55 UTC","Latitude":"42.581512","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.581512,+-83.027703(38597)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38597) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"05/27/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Two witnesses spotted two orange lights","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38597.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38597.html"],"Case Number":"38597","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Sterling Heights","There was one other sighting in Sterling Heights on or around May 27th 2012"]}
