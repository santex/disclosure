{"Date Submitted":"10/28/2009 02:47 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were attending a \"pig-picking\" outdoor roast at my friend's home off of Hwy 96. We were asked to drive to a local quick-mart to pick up several needed items. Went to the store, then turned onto Hwy 96 coming back. A glint caught my eye in the car, so I looked. There was a vehicle slowly rising from a hill @ a third of a mile to my right. I asked my wife, Cindy, if she saw it and she said yes. We pulled onto the shoulder and stopped. WE DIDN'T HAVE A CAMERA! The vehicle's base was an upside-down saucer with a round \"turret\" on top. It slowly rose from the hill, hovered, then accelerated at amazing speed angling upwards, but doing so in a zig-zag pattern until it disappeared into high altitude clouds a good 3 miles down Hwy 96. We returned to the festivities and I decided to tell the proprietor of the party what we saw. He poo-pood it, so we decided not to mention it to anyone else. I forgot to mention that the entire surface of the vehicle looked like polished aluminum."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20171.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20171.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"20171","Country":"United States","Region":"Tennessee","Summary":"Saw object slowly rise from hill, then zig-zag at high speed away","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.17288,+-86.780163(20171)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20171) map </A>","Latitude":"36.17288","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date of the Event":"08/27/1994 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around August 27th 1994"],"Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-10282009-0011","Longitude":"-86.780163","City":"Nashville","Tags":"City"}
