{"City":"Lakewood","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt appeared to be a fireball leaving a trail of sparks several hundred feet long behind it except that it moved up and down changing direction every 3 or 4 seconds definitely not a meteor. The trail would also linger for about 10 seconds. It could also disappear and reapear instantly and was joined by a second similar object before both finally went away. It appeared almost alive like a giant snake made of sparks flying thru the sky. It appeared to be centered around the south east face of Green Mountain in Lakewood. There was a chopper with a search light on in the air around the area about 5-10 minutes after the objects disappeared. My first job was at an airport and I've never seen anything like this before, very unusual."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.70771,+-105.071613(24745)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24745) map </A>","Case Number":"24745","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24745.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24745.html"],"trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Lakewood","There were no other sightings in Lakewood on or around July 24th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/25/2010 05:54 UTC","Summary":"Giant luminous and snaking fireball.","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/24/2010 09:56 UTC","Longitude":"-105.071613","Latitude":"39.70771","Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Fireball, Unknown","Log Number":"US-07252010-0001"}
