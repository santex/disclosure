As we were sitting on the beach, we noticed a brightly lit object flying at a low altitude ( its lights were reflecting on the water) We watched it fade , disappear, reappear , then 2 more popped up, & do the same thing etc.. Then my fiance at the time, thought he'd flick a lighter at them - to see if they could see us.. Funny we thought... But It appeared they were getting closer.. By this time it was about 945 or so.. Next thing I know, I feel completely OVERWHELMED with total fear from head to toe- and was shaking. I started screaming bloody murder an ran off the beach. He followed behind me. We got in the car and it was 12:45 AM! 3 hours of my life just disappeared."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"05/29/1998 09:15 UTC","Summary":"Missing time","Longitude":"-81.514434","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3756","Source":"MUFON","trends":[]}
