We followed it to Olmos Park. When we got out, it was about 9:00 p.m., it had been dark for about an hour, so it was hard to see anything except a bright illuminated outline of a creature in the park. We got out to inspect the situation. There were a few other men with flashlights who helped. Then the figure disappeared, like faded. Uh, what should I do? I m not sure who to call. There were some bent bushes and alot of witnesses in the park, but I m not sure how reliable they ll be."],"trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around April 16th 2005"],"City":"San Antonio","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.429782,+-98.490728(3473)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3473) map </A>","Longitude":"-98.490728"}
