I noticed a bright object appear to the north that then faded to the brightness of the rest of the stars. I thought it might be an airplane but didn't see any navigation lights, which I thought was curious. The object look like a star but was moving across the sky so I then thought it might be a satellite but moving much faster than satellites that I had seen in the past. I kept watching as it traveled across the sky and then it turned upward and as it ascended it faded out. I was trying to get my brother to look but by the time he turned it was gone. I then called my Dad and let him know what just occurred."],"Log Number":"US-09142013-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Case Number":"50817","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.91251,+-92.275372(50817)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50817) map </A>","Latitude":"38.91251","City":"Columbia","Date of the Event":"09/13/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw a bright light appear then fade to star like brightness.
