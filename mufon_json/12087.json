I heard a low roar to the south that was blocked by a tree. I got up and walked around the tree to see what it was and saw a large oblong object going very slow almost hovering in the sky. It turned from a south to north direction and heaed west. It made a very low rumbling roar loader than most planes. It was also going slower than most planes. It was 3 to 4 times larger than a 737. It lasted approximately 40 to 45 seconds. It had 3 to four lights in a row and had no wings on it. It was quite a shock of seeing it. I stood there for several seconds and then started trying to get my wife to come outside to see it. I was running down the road to try and keep it in sight."],"Date of the Event":"08/15/2008 09:30 UTC"}
