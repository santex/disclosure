It flickered green, blue, white, and red. I believe it was around early 1am, or late 12 am. We thought it could have been a plane, but it was staying in the same area for too long. Sporadically it would move in circular motions, or make fast jets to the left and right or just hover there. The flickering of the lights didn't look like a glowing dot, but gave the object little flares simulating a star. Once we got outside, we realized there was another one, but it was much further away."],"Summary":"looked like 2 flashing stars flickering color, moving around.","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in National City","There were no other sightings in National City on or around February 10th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-117.092337","Case Number":"27753","Date Submitted":"02/10/2011 05:29 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02102011-0004","City":"National City"}
