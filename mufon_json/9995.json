I just happened to yawn and look up and see this thing. I was slow, and silent, but it was MASSIVE, and moving over my head. I knew it was rectangular from the 4 lights in the corners, and how it was bleeping out stars. It went into the distance and started to rotate. And then... it blinked out. I've never seen it since but I wonder, was it real, Or what?I mean at first i thought it was a plane. but, 1.To big 2.It rotated and 3. It was dead silent The whole time i just gawked and stared at it until it dissapeared. I wish I knew what it was."],"Longitude":"-84.545745","Object Features":"Wings, Other","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9995.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9995.html"],"City":"Lansing","Log Number":"US-03202008-0014","Tags":"City","Summary":"Black.
