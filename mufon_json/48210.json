Was a bright glowing object caught my attention. It almost appeared to be what looked like a Chinese glowing lantern, however, it then picked up speed and disintegrated. I was very scared, shaking, hair on end. There were 2 of us that seen the object. Just as quick as it was gone, we both turned around and there was another large flash through the air, quick, so quick we couldn't tell what it was, or if it was the same type of object. As quick as a falling star for the second one. Just caught our attention, but scared us both and hair on end. I was extremely scared. The original siting just eventually just disintegrated and never came back.
