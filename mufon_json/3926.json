I saw something out of the corner of my eye and notice there were two red stars next to a brighter white one. I thought it was a plane at first because it was flashing red, but they started moving closer to each other. One stayed close to a white star, the other moved more to the west, then south, then down. They stayed that way, with the one on the right slowly moving farther away. They looked like they were bouncing up and down in place. Then the one on the right flickered and disappeared. About 30 seconds later, the other one left also."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Chicago","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3926","Longitude":"-87.622188","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around September 30th 2005"]}
