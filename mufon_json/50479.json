We rolled down the windows and opened the sunroof to try and get a better look at it as it kept moving northwest and knew that it was something that I felt I needed to get on video if possible. The object appeared as a solid flame that resembled when the rope on a hot air balloon is pulled to release gas into it. But there was no balloon above it and the flame stayed constantly flickering brightly as it went across the sky. I would estimate it took about 10 minutes to disappear from our view in the western sky. We were baffled as to what we had just seen and still have no explanation for it. Neither of us have ever seen anything out of the ordinary in our lives. The height was approximately what a normal cloud would be."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.605515,+-93.608106(50479)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50479) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"41.605515","Region":"Iowa","Date of the Event":"08/10/2013 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09062013-0019","Country":"United States","Case Number":"50479","City":"Des Moines","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Large bright fire ball in the sky at night moving west","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50479.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50479.html"],"Longitude":"-93.608106","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
