{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was just a few minutes ago and it was incredible!! I watched and I could see the stars it passed but they slightly distorted I think it was a big triangle shaped craft but Huge!! Or 3 Lights in formation I could not be certain. This is not the only event I have witnessed since moving back to California I have been reluctant to report them as it was not my first sighting I have reported.. I can���t stop Looking Up!! I also seen about a month ago a huge Surfboard shaped light flying at a 45 degree angle (it looked from my few) flying from out over the ocean towards the east..
