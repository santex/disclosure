They traveled across the sky, some singular, some in formation. At one point 3 were in triangular arrangement and two of them maneuvered around each other, switching places in the formation but staying exactly as equidistant as they had been. Seemed very close together and moving swiftly across the sky. Then each disappeared about halfway across sky, perhaps into clouds. It started to rain shortly after the lights stopped coming. I called my daughter to see them so that I had a witness, and took photos with my cell phone which show objects but no details other than orange color. They were quite beautiful and I felt very happy to see them as I've had sightings in the past of other unknown objects and it has been a long time since that has happened. In all maybe 15 to 20 objects from around 10:30 to 11:00 PM -- on November 23, 2012."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.316753,+-72.925548(44218)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44218) map </A>","Longitude":"-72.925548","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","City":"New Haven","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Orange lights in sky","Case Number":"44218","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44218.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44218.html"]}
