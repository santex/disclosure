We were traveling south on route 93. At approximately mile marker # 91 around Campton, N.H., and around 7:55pm we saw off to the south west a brite white cone of light. It was stationery and brite for some # of seconds then all of a sudden it seemed as though whatever was there left and all you had left was a cone of light which slowly disapated. It did not appear that the cone of light was close to the ground,it was up in the sky, and was hard to judge how high it was. Our first thoughts were that it was lights of a helicopter, but after the cone dissapeared there were no running lights at all that helicopters have. We were very excited and new this was really unusual especially when we realized it was not a plane or helicopter."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
