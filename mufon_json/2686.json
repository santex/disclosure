I saw three lights in a line approx 30-40 ft over a treeline about 34 of a mileaway. Actual footage cannot be calculated because there wasn't an accurate third point for triangulation. I called for both my wife and son to come out to see it. The three of us viewed the objects for about 5 min before all three lights began to tilt and raise slightly. The right light Highest cut off shortly followed by the other two in unison as the light cluster began to take off. We waited to see if the sillouette would go over us but the objects must have taken a different flight path. North Easternly path @ 15-40 degree Notes. No noise. Perfectly motionless hover. Estimated distance from outside light to outside light- 300-450 wide Again no third point for size triangulation. The area over which the object hovered is a large patch of woods located in the middle of a medium sized city."],"Case Number":"2686","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"10/25/2003 01:30 UTC","Latitude":"35.088696","Region":"Arkansas","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Conway","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2686.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2686.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Conway","There were no other sightings in Conway on or around October 25th 2003"],"Longitude":"-92.442101","Summary":"SAW 3 HOVERING LIGHTS CONNECTED"}
