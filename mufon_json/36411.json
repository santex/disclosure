We stopped and got out of the car to look at it better It flew in a straight path as it got further away it made a large right to left curving motion as if it was going to turn but never did. We were fascinated by the speed of the flying object and watched it fly out of site towards the south."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36411.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/12/2012 12:27 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, N/A","Case Number":"36411","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/08/2012 08:20 UTC","Summary":"A jet fast flying object with single light making curve directional change"}
