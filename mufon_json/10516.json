Exactly two minutes into our walk we observed a bright white oval object with a redish-orange tail moving slowly above us in the western direction. The craft appeared to be the size of a dime at arms length. The craft made no discernable noise as it passed slowly overhead. Without warning it flashing a bright green color then all color ceased to reveal a smaller albeit same shaped black object that shot out of view over several rooftops."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
