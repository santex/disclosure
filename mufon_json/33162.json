I noticed one of the constellations, and was trying to find more. I saw an abstract light formation in the North-West sky. Upon seeing this object, I knew it was no star, but some sort of UFO. The lights were moving their formation rapidly, with the brightest staying in the middle of the group. The lights started to disappear, as in fade against the sky, and they had stopped their movements. This was after roughly 7 minutes of observing the object. The lights had come back into the view after about 2 minutes of being \"gone\". Upon seeing this, I was awestruck, as it was the first of such things I have seen. I was still very excited when I went to report it. I had not actually lost sight of the object, but I had headed inside."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11062011-0003","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.641774","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33162.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33162_submitter_file1__004.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33162_submitter_file2__005.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33162.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.641774,+-77.581951(33162)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33162) map </A>","Case Number":"33162"}
