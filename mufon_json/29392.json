Was at Ft. Jackson It was about 2200 hr. We were standing outside waiting to be assigned our sleeping quarters for the night. I was looking up at the stars when all of a sudden one of them took off in what appeared to be an acending zig-zag pattern. First it went to the left then right and to the left and disapeared. The whole thing only lasted about 3 seconds. It has been 46 years and I can't forget the night. Have no idea what I saw that night. I would like to know if ther were any other reports from that time or of that nature. thank you Frank Sykes"],"Summary":"Looking at stars and one of them took off in an acending zig-zag pattern","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.055074","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"South Carolina","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29392.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29392.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"06/04/2011 12:44 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06042011-0016","Tags":"City","Case Number":"29392","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
