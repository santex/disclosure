I noticed an airplane type flashing lite in the sky, and thought it was a plane. But i dont remember planes having red,blue,green, and white lites. It seemed to sway side to side like a horse shoe, but i cant confirm it wasn't me doing it.When i got a chance i took 3 videos of it with my galaxy4 phone. Of course the video did not do it justice."],"Latitude":"39.649763","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
