As I drove about 40mph along a road in town, a bright light zipped by overhead. I watched it for a few seconds until it disappeared at the horizon. I have seen many meteors. This was not a meteor. The main \"source\" light was very bright and did not flicker. The secondary \"aircraft\" lights were blue and flashed at regular intervals. I did not have my car's radio on and did not hear any sounds made by the UFO. Something traveling as fast as it did, and as low as it did, should have created a sonic boom. It was the fastest and most visually consistent object I've that ever seen."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-85.727915","Latitude":"38.28106","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-11102012-0001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
