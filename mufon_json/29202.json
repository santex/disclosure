Estimated size about 10 meters. Continuesly accelerating and decelerating while moving in a circular path. It emmits a very low frequency ,almost subsonic, noise. Many people now are observing from the street. Even some cars stopped and drivers exited to observe it better. Took some photos with mobile phone. I'm little scared. Don't know if It's safe to observe and what may happen next. Will try to take more photos and upload as soon as possible"],"Summary":"triangular equilateral with 7 orange lights and glowing yellowish","Case Number":"29202","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29202.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29202.html"],"Longitude":"23.74041","Date of the Event":"05/23/2011 02:00 UTC","Region":"Attica","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"GR-05222011-0018","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.980686,+23.74041(29202)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29202) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"05/22/2011 07:16 UTC"}
