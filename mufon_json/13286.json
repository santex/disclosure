I was sitting there poking at the fire looking throught the trees at the stars when i noticed a very bright star like object moving toward me. When i noticed this object moving i jumped up and told my girlfriend to follow me to the reservoir so we could see it without tree cover. We ran to the reservoir it was about 40 ft from the compsite. When we got to the edge of the reservoir it was at an 45 degree angle in front of us. As we stood there and watched it go over our heads north it had no sound. I was very excited. It went north for about 2 miles and turned east and went over the mountain and was gone. We were both in ahh. It was one of the best experiences of my life."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Bend","There were no other sightings in Bend on or around July 19th 2008"]}
