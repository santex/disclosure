{"Latitude":"33.078733","Case Number":"13569","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Boyd","There were no other sightings in Boyd on or around November 5th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-11062008-0016","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing alone smoking a cigarette outside my back door facing west at approximately 8 pm the evening of nov. the 5th, 2008. a bright flashin green and red light combination caught my eye. i live on a private rd, as there is no traffic, we have a habit of watching the air traffic. there is lots, as we are located near several airports. the lights came from the south moving to the north and it struck me \"what is that?\" the lights were very bright. i started to go get my husband, but hesitated as i thought i might miss whatever it was. i watched it start to turn east and noticed a bright white light, like a plane headlight following it. i walked around the north side of my house and through my bedroom door i called my husband out, as i realized whatever it was it was moving very slow. he came and immediately started saying the same \"what is that?\" it moved very slowly, smoothly, with no bouncing or shaking. i studied it and saw one main bright green light and two blinking red lights, one to the front and one to the side facing me. i tried to focus on the actual craft, but it appeared to be darker in the center... just a black mass. its hard to explain that. the other white light continued to follow it, and maybe even point towards it, maybe trying to see it? the white light looked like every other plane coming in for landing, same red and green landing lights on it, same white headlamps... then both objects turned back towards the south, and continued on that way. we kept watching them until they flew behind some trees and we could no longer see them. we then began discussing what it was, and i wondered if it was a plane that close why didnt we hear it? just then maybe 10- 15 seconds after we could not see it, you could hear a noise similar to a helicopter, but without the chop-chop of the blades. but it was a sound i have never heard before. and did not last very long at all. i have seen a lot of planes, helicopters, personal aircraft everything out here... and this contradicts everything i have seen before. if it was a plane so close for me to be dazzled by the green and red landing lights, i should have heard it. (and i have never seen such a large craft so low to the ground) if it was far away to leave the trailing sound, it should have been a twinkly white light with flashes or red or green.... and the sound, doesnt add up either. i dont believe this was aliens. ;O) but i am wondering if it is connected to the stephenville lights, or the local military base, or both. i will continue to look and see if i see anything else, but i just wanted to report this, as nothing like this has ever happened to me before. one more note, i dont know if this matters, but my 2 dogs and my neihgbors dogs were barking the whole time i could see it, not before, and not after... thanks"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"object in night sky - very bright red blinking lights, one bright green solid light on a very dark object followed by bright white light similar to normal plane. sound was odd, and much delayed","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13569.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13569.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Boyd","Date of the Event":"11/05/2008 08:00 UTC","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"11/05/2008 08:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-97.565303","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Windy","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.078733,+-97.565303(13569)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13569) map </A>"}
