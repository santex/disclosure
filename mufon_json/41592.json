Originally thought to be an airplane but the consistently bright white lights pulsated and there was no landing gear or noise. The object was going faster than a commercial plane would. It went from one side of the horizon all the way to the other side in a mostly arc type path. The object was about the size of an aspirin in the sky but seemed FAR away. Me and my friend who were going to the store to get cigarettes, stopped to witness the event and it lasted for about 5 minutes. Others stopped and noticed the object. They were drunk and cited that it probably was a satelite. Albeit a very bright and fast satelite. My friend and I were sober and definitely disagree. This was in our opinion not a known object or satelite."],"Latitude":"43.16708","Case Number":"41592","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Region":"New York","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41592.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/09/2012 09:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.16708,+-77.604042(41592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41592) map </A>","trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around August 7th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
