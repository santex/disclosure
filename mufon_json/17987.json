Now I don't believe in UFO's but I'm diying to know what was that green light in the sky. PS: I tried to take a picture or recorded video, but it was so dark so nothing appeared on the pictures or the video."],"trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Halifax","There were no other sightings in Halifax on or around July 8th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"44.654541","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City"}
