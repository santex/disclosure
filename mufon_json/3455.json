I wasn t sure who to give this info to. If there is someone else I shoudl contact please let me know. I took my binos out to look at Jupiter in order to show it oto my grandkids. I took the binos cause I wasn t sure we could get a good enough look and didn t want to take the scope out until I was sure. While I was looking at Jupiter a \"point of llight\" shot across the planet and kept going. We live near the airport and I thought it was probably a plane but it was much too high and much too fast! I followed it in the binos. It went left turnied and went right then when straight up and to the left again. NO PLANE OR HELICOPTER could have made this manuever. I come form a long line of pilots and know no plane of copter coud do this. Sorry I can t describe it better. Anyother reports of anything in this area? Thanks Lynn"]}
