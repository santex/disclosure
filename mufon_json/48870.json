{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI live here in Ocean View on the Big Island and saw the red \"Light\" ..... it was around 9 pm .... It wasn't a flare nor any type of fireworks.... It stayed in one place...not moving.... at about 30 to 35 degrees in the sky ...I viewed through my trees! Unfortunately, I ran in the house to get my zoom lense on the camera....and POOF!! it was gone. I'm so happy to hear someone else on the island saw it too!!!
