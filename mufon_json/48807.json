{"Date of the Event":"07/03/2013 11:35 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange Circle - Four beams of light","Region":"North Dakota","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile in my backyard myself and my son were looking for satellites. He spotted the object first coming up from the southern sky. Object was as bright as an airplane but had no exterior lights (Green and Red found on the wing tips). At first I thought it could be an airplane but did not see the lights. Object was very orange in color and was fuzzy on all of the edges as it passed over. No sound was emitted as planes do when they are flying over even at high altitudes. When the object was directly overhead it emitted four beams of light in the direction it was traveling. We both could distinctly see the four beams turn on and then turn off after being on for about five seconds. These beams had a distinct end as they became very concentrated at the four end points. Much like a flash light pointed at a wall. The longer I observed this object the more uneasy I became as it was definitely not anything that I had ever experienced. We lost sight of the object as it passed north over the horizon."],"Latitude":"47.554273","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07082013-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.554273,+-100.998422(48807)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48807) map </A>","trends":[],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48807.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48807.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/08/2013 03:50 UTC","Case Number":"48807","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-100.998422"}
