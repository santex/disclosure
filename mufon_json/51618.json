She called me and I managed to get 2 still shots and a short video of it with my cell phone. I have some piloting experience with small aircraft and this was not anything I recognized. The craft made no sound and appeared to be a bloom of light that altered course as it flew from the west to east then turned slowly to the south east. the craft then increased altitude until it went out of sight. The lights that it emitted changed color fluctuating into different shades of red orange and yellow. If you have additional questions or would like to speak to me about the incident send me an email."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-10172013-0020","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"10/17/2013 07:35 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/17/2013 08:18 UTC","Case Number":"51618","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.670707,+-81.509304(51618)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51618) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51618.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51618.html"],"Summary":"A soundless aircraft that bloomed light not navigation lights","Longitude":"-81.509304","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[]}
