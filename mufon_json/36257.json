{"Case Number":"36257","Country":"Russian Federation","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWell me and my family were driving along a small road near Saint Petersburg. We wanted to camp out there. We were driving until our car and everything electronic we had slowly stopped working. When we looked out the window we saw a large disc hovering above a forest near us. We watched it and we were all very tense. I became so scared that my heart rate was getting very high. The UFO was metalic-black and there were very bright yellow lights on it. It hovered for about 5minutes then it very fast shot away. Out car turned back on and we went back to Petrozavodsk because we were very scared! (We believe \"aliens\" aren't friendly beings)"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/05/2012 04:21 UTC","Latitude":"60.081728","Object Features":"Dome","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"St Petersburg","Source":"MUFON","Region":"St Petersburg","Date of the Event":"03/02/2012 01:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St Petersburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36257.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36257.html"],"Summary":"Tense and Scary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"RU-03052012-0003","Longitude":"30.123873","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=60.081728,+30.123873(36257)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36257) map </A>"}
