I was planning to spend the evening just star gazing on the side yard. I had just sat down and when I first looked up, my eyes stopped at the top of the trees in front of me at about 45 degrees in the sky and I was staring at what seemed to be a boomarang at about the size of one and a half inches at arms length, was moving to the north. I would say that the trek, went from 45 degrees, thru 90 degrees and another 45 degrees in about 25 seconds and then the right side raised up and it turned to the left at about 30 degrees and went behind the trees there. At first, I thought that it was an experimental aircraft that they wanted to hear if anyone could see it, then, a flock of geese, no geese sounds plus when it took the 30 turn and raised the right side of the craft which I believe geese wouldn't mimic. It was the most amazing sight that I have ever seen in my life, I stood in my yard for 10 minutes, searching the sky with my jaw dropped!!!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"New Braunfels","Date of the Event":"04/22/2011 09:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28811.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28811.html"],"Case Number":"28811","Log Number":"US-04252011-0007","Latitude":"29.712162","Summary":"It had no light and no sound, a little lighter than the dark sky","Longitude":"-98.120463","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/25/2011 02:33 UTC","Object Features":"None"}
