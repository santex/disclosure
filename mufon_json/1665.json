The object simply moved into and out of my fieldof vision.3.My mind rapidly interpreted first a bird, then a plane.4.I expectedto hear some kind of sound as it was apparent the object was not a bird (far toofast). I was amazed to have seen so much detail in such a short period of time.If the object was some order of stealth technology it was utterly silent andsomehow created no atmospheric shock waves at supersonic speed. It did not havewings as it was a thick black triangular object. My reaction was one of mildexcitation following the calm observation.5.It moved in a straight line north tosouth at about 40 degrees to the sw directly through my field of vision. I wouldestimate it to be traveling at an elevation of approximatly 1500 ft. at a speedin excess of 2000 mph.6. I lost sight of the object behind a tree."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/25/2002 04:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Fast silent thick black triangle north to south lo","Source":"MUFON","City":"Grants Pass","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Region":"Oregon","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.439007,+-123.328392(1665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1665) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1665.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1665.html"],"Case Number":"1665","Log Number":"","Date Submitted":"04/25/2002 04:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
