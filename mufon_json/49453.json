I went out to have a cigarette and noticed several balls of light creeping in an eerily slow manner into the sky. Several other observers joined me to get a decent look. The balls started in sets of four or five, flying into the sky. They appeared to saved as if they contained fire. Slowly the lights would dim and then disapear. One or two I noted started to fall and then completely dissapeared. As each dissapeared, a new set would appear over the horizon. The most I could see at one time was something near ten. I at first thought that they seemed like weather ballrooms powered byy fire, but dismissed that due to the sheer number and a lack of reasoning as to their purpose."],"Log Number":"US-08042013-0027","Longitude":"-117.14736","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49453.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49453.html"],"trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There was one other sighting in San Diego on or around August 3rd 2013"],"Source":"MUFON"}
