{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was asleep in my bed in Orr, Minnesota on Pelican Lake's south shore. The light was so bright that it came thru the room darkening curtains and woke me. I couldn't figure out what it was that woke me for the first few moments, as I said, I had been asleep. I got out of bed and walked to the window to see what was making the light, and all I could see was bright light. Everything in the woods was lit up brightly. I could not see a source for the light. I was going to wake my husband and the light went out. There was no explanation. The following morning, I mentioned this to my husband. Neither of us could come up with an explanation. Later that day, my husband was talking with a neighbor who lives about a mile away, and to our surprise, he experienced a similar ordeal. He however, was awake when he saw the unexplaned light."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"12/13/2009 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/16/2009 04:33 UTC","Case Number":"21018","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-92.831002","Region":"Minnesota","Summary":"very bright light - no noise","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.053527,+-92.831002(21018)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21018) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Orr","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"48.053527","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Flash","Log Number":"US-12162009-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21018.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Orr","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
