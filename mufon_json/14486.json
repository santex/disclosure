They attracted my attention as they were distinct in the sky and at a hight that made them stand out in the open sky. Since they appeared to be distant (or small) I couldn't tell how high they actually were. At first I thought that they were hotair baloons, but there were no baskets or other appendages.They appeared to be at some distance North of camelback mountain and to the West. They were at the same hight and appeared stationary. I looked at them as best I could while driving. As I turned North I looked away and then after completing the turn I looked again as I thought I would have a better view looking directly at them and they were gone. My feelings were of curiosity. I have seen the Phoenix lights and one other questionable object in the past, so I am more curious that affected."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"Arizona","Summary":"Two hot air balloon looking metallic objects, but no baskets.","Date Submitted":"12/20/2008 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-112.070707","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.451837,+-112.070707(14486)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14486) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14486.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14486.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/20/2008 08:30 UTC"}
