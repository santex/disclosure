I had to let mycat out and I looked up at the stars. I thought the object was just a verybright star. I was calm yet scared. When I saw it, there appeared two brightlights on the same object. Then it turned and headed south. Then it turned and Isaw the back of it. There were five rocket engines. Then my mind connected withthe creatures. I saw a reptile-like creature and it turned and walked away. Iregained my own sight and saw two smaller lights. They got bright and vanished.Before the bigger ship vanished, the creature told me not to be afraid and I sawhim grin. A second later the ship got bright and vanished.
