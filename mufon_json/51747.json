I called to my son to look at it and at that time we noticed two objects. My wife and daughter noticed a third solid (non-flashing) object south of the two that were flashing. I thought the objects were floating with the air current until the two objects circled each other. A fourth object lower on the horizon was also flashing but it looked to have color red and blue. we watched for a little while and they faded away. We got about 2 or three minutes of video."],"Log Number":"US-10222013-0022","Date of the Event":"10/20/2013 03:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Looked like reflective sheet metal or or large white paper tumbling","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Queen Creek","There were no other sightings in Queen Creek on or around October 20th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"10/22/2013 06:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Arizona","City":"Queen Creek"}
