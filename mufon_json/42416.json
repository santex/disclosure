They fly in a straight line and make no noise. Too slow to be a meteor and to high to be a plane, plus they make NO noise. Not a copter, not a star or meteor, not a comet, not a plane, ??????. I see them ALL the time, only at night, and they're really high up there. I see jets and planes fly over all of the time and they're not the same. They don't blink or anything. It is hard for me to get a video because all I have is an Iphone but I'll try. Please let me know what you think and contact me!"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Gassville","There were no other sightings in Gassville on or around September 8th 2012"],"Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42416.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42416.html"],"Log Number":"US-09092012-0018","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
