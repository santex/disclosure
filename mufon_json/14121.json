{"Case Number":"14121","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 6:30- 7:00 pm my friend and I were outside in the backyard when I noticed, very high up in the sky, a tiny flashing dot. At first, we assumed the obvious. A flashing, blinking light high up in the night sky is a jet. However, within the five minutes we kept our eyes on it, it barely moved across the sky. Scale wise, it moved from one side of some tree branches to the trees opposite side in the slow time of approximately 5 minutes. Too slow to be a jet, yet much too fast to be stars moving across the horizon. The flashing light was so high up it was about the size of a tiny star. We watched it for the 5 minutes when it suddenly seemed to just disappear or stop blinking."],"Log Number":"US-11292008-0009","Date of the Event":"11/28/2008 06:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14121.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14121.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/28/2008 06:30 UTC","Summary":"Very slow moving tiny blinking light that seemed to disappear.","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Huntington","There were no other sightings in Huntington on or around November 28th 2008"],"City":"Huntington","Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.871394,+-73.417826(14121)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14121) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.417826","Latitude":"40.871394","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
