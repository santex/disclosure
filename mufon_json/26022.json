I noticed two stars at an even distance to jupiter, as if there were three stars lined up at equal distance. I closely watched these to stars and it seemed they were moving ever so little that i stood there watching for a few min., before i was certain they were not stars. At the moment i concluded this, the two star like objects turn at a 45 deg. angle, pass below jupiter and as the last star passed jupiter, they stopped and slowly faded to a red, then dissipated."],"Region":"Indiana","Date Submitted":"10/22/2010 12:35 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/20/2010 08:15 UTC"}
