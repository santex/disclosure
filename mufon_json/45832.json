Both myself and the (adult) individual in the passenger seat noticed a glowing missile-shaped object moving towards the city at great speed, far faster than a plane. It seemed to almost go into the city, but it's hard to tell...may have simply been lost in the lights and passed it. That said, we both commented we were bracing for an explosion from the city ahead of us. I don't know if it was a UFO or what, but it didn't move or otherwise resemble anything I'd be aware of. Closest would be a large missile, but I didn't see any explosion. And of course, missiles don't glow. I don't particularly think it's alien in origin - it's probably a drone being tested or somesuch - but I just don't know."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Cone","Log Number":"US-02222013-0007","Region":"Nevada","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","City":"Las Vegas","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
