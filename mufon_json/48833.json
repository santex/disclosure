Had fuzzy aura looked similar to paint brush marks coming from one side of the sphere. Moved slowly and direct path. I first thought it was a falling star but much to big and no tail. I saw a smaller red orb flying a few months ago. The red sphere flew much faster and was much smaller. It also flew in the exact opposite direction of the new white sphere. Lost sight as it went over the hill. I would really love to know what they are. We are going to attempt setting a camera on the roof."],"Region":"Washington","Latitude":"38.896332"}
