It appears about 2-3 a week around 4-5 am but in a different area of the sky each time. I've used my cell phone star map and can see no stars in the area around this time of the morning over the course of September or October. I've seen this thing since Mid-Sept. It's creepy... it moves slowly like a star or a satellite but it then drops or moves to the right significantly enough that it couldn't be a star. I've take pictures and video and will try to attach to this posting so someone can tell me what this is?"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"object in the Eastern sky pulsating major color and moving in a strange trajectory.
