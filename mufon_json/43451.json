{"Longitude":"-122.464754","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was Playing video games when my dad yelled for me to come out, it only took me a matter of seconds to get outside through our sliding door. I looked up and saw a Orange Pulsating Orb that was fairly high up it appeared to possibly be about as high up as a airliner.We have seen the orange orb before also on july 4th,5th,and 6th but had 3 witnesses then and the orb to me appeared to be a UFO. The Orb was moving in a straight line for about 20 seconds from West to East toward Idaho it then stopped and hovered in place for another 30 seconds then continued East and disapeared into the clouds. Once i saw the object i was very surprised to see the orb once again.but i wasn't afraid i was exited and happy. The Pictures i included are not from this sighting, there from my july 6th sighting you will most likely need to zoom in to see it well. but i figured you would like to look."],"Date Submitted":"10/21/2012 11:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.175217,+-122.464754(43451)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43451) map </A>","Latitude":"47.175217","Date of the Event":"10/19/2012 09:02 UTC","Region":"Washington","Object Shape":"Oval","City":"Tacoma","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Summary":"orange pulsating Orb that stopped hovered directly above. then continued its direction East","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Tacoma","There were no other sightings in Tacoma on or around October 19th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Case Number":"43451","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10212012-0028","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43451.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43451.html"]}
