When I first saw the object, I thought it was amilitary jet fighter aircraft. I didnt notice any wings or tail section on thecraft so I grabbed by Sony Mavica FD88 digital camera and immediately snapped apicture of the object. As soon as the camera reset, I zoomed to full capacityand snapped another picture. My camera uses 3.5 floppy disks, which I amsubmitting the original to you with this form. The object was traveling from SWand heading NE leaving two vapor trails behind it. It appeared a red-orangecolor which may have been caused by the sun light reflections as the sun was lowon the horizon. The Moon was overhead with a clear calm sky as it passed over. I watched it go out of sight in a NE direction. The object was traveling veryfast and the sighting lasted only two to three minutes total. I live about fourmiles north of Grapeland, Texas off of US 287_east about one mile."],"City":"Grapeland","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grapeland","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-95.478561"}
