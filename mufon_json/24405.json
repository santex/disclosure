We thought it was a flair or some kind of firework but learned quickly that it wasn't. We jumped in our car and drove out to try to get a better look at it. We lost the craft and then started to head home when we saw it again. It was moving slowly over the subdivision so we went down a street that it was about to cross. It slowly moved over our car and we then saw it change into a different red upside down parachute look. It also started to get more clear and not so fire red. It then took over only to come back about 20 minutes later for a brief time to hover once again then suddenly disappear. I'm not the type to EVER report anything like this but this to me was a real UFO. Nothing can explain what I saw..."],"Date of the Event":"07/09/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24405.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.634565,+-89.395408(24405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24405) map </A>","Latitude":"40.634565","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Looked like a red fireball but then changed shape to an upside down parachute look."}
