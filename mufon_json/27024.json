At first I thought it was a bird since there was a flock nearby, but then I noticed that the object appeared to stay very still, it was too high in the air to be a bird and it was shiny, reflecting light from the sun. i looked away for a second and then back and it had moved its location slightly. I had to keep driving but I'm positive it was a UFO."],"Log Number":"US-12172010-0005","Region":"Maine","City":"Yarmouth","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Oval","Date Submitted":"12/17/2010 08:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Yarmouth","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Shiny oval shaped UFO hovering over Yarmouth","Longitude":"-70.186723","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27024.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27024.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.800621,+-70.186723(27024)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27024) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
