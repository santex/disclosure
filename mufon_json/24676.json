I joined family members in the front yard watching the children. I had a green laser which I used to point out stars when star gazing. I was flashing at the star Vega, when I seen a series of flashes. I thought it may have been a response, I was surprized and shouted, \"what the heck.\" Other members asked me what was wrong and I told them I had seen flashes and pointed out where they eminated from. The flashes continued in a sequence of three flashes and occurred three complete times. Two adult family members witness the flashes after I pointed them out. They appeared to be orange in color and very distant, not aircraft lights or a satillite, these flashes did not appear to move aganist the background star field. Thay appeared roughly overhead at the time, and I live in a remote area, so fireworks or other man-made sources are not likley. I was amazed to what I had witness and don't have any idea what these flashes may have been, but I continue to watch the sky in the same area."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Summary":"Viewed flashes in the sky, appeared similar to a beacon.","Region":"Arizona","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St Michaels","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"07/20/2010 03:48 UTC","Weather Factors":"None"}
