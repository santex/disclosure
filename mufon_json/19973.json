While I was waiting for the light to turn green, my eyes were scanning the area then I looked up at the sky. That's when I saw something I never saw before, a white, brightly lit \"flying saucer\". I quickly looked at traffic light to see if it had yet turned green and then refocused my eyes to where I had seen the UFO but, to my chagrin, the UFO had disappeared from sight."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"19973","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19973.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19973.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Glenolden","There were no other sightings in Glenolden on or around June 20th 1989"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Glenolden","Date of the Event":"06/20/1989 08:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/16/2009 10:56 UTC","Longitude":"-75.289074","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.900113,+-75.289074(19973)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19973) map </A>","Latitude":"39.900113","Country":"United States","Summary":"Looked up and saw a brightly lit \"flying saucer\"","Log Number":"US-10162009-0014"}
