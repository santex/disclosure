They seemed to be \"twinkling\" like stars, and were going really fast..... What caught my eye was the pretty colors... At first, I thought it was some aircraft, but nothing like that was arouns was flying around.... Just gave me a feeling like \"WOW, what did I just witness?\" Never saw anything like that in all of my 60 years!! People say it was just a reflection from the sun rising, or a reflection off of my windshield, etc...but the sun was not out yet. It was still cloudy, except where some of the sky was really clear, and that is where I saw those lights!!!!!!!!! Pretty wild....... Unfortunately, I did not have anything to take pictures with..that's the first thing I said to myself--\"Wish I had a camera!\""],"Date Submitted":"02/13/2011 08:33 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.46867","Summary":"bright green, twinkling-like stars, rapid and moving horizontally","Object Flight Path":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27800.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27800.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/13/2011 06:33 UTC","Log Number":"US-02132011-0005"}
