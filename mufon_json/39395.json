While she was sniffing around doing her thing, I looked up above the church that is across the street and there was a VERY large, dimly lit, white object moving VERY fast from my right to my left. It was pretty low to the ground, not as high as an airplane might be. There were no blinking lights on it that would indicate a commercial aircraft and it made no sound as it moved through the sky. Just before it went over a set of trees (where I would have lost sight of it) it grew VERY bright white, almost as bright as a full moon, and shot straight up into the air at breakneck speeds. I was in the Air Force for 6 years. I've never seen, in person, an aircraft capable of this maneuver. I have always believed in UFOs but have never actually seen one, until tonight! Purely the most amazing thing I've ever witnessed with my own eyes!"]}
