As the lights got over our heads, we heard the distinct sound of jet airplanes in formation. We observed these lights circling Lees Summit for approximately 45 minutes. The reason I'm writing you is because we've been watching some of the flap over this particular sighting, and while we've seen some weird stuff in the sky over Lees Summit in the past few months, this was undeniably a group of jets flying perfectly in formation."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11032011-0014","Date of the Event":"10/31/2011 07:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33106.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33106.html"]}
