I wondered if it was a meteor shower but they were traveling in a row and not burning out and lasted much longer than that. They were moving extremely quickly and in a line one behind the other. As they got closer they were more brilliant in their glow and I ran inside to grab my camera. As I emerged 15 seconds later they had already made significant progress and 2 were out of sight. The object appeared to have almost bug like wings that were also glowing orange. They were gone before I knew it so obviously not jets....too fast. I was able to get one picture as they were almost gone."],"Summary":"5 fast glowing orange orbs over Round Rock, Texas.","Date Submitted":"08/16/2010 10:38 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25106.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25106.html"]}
