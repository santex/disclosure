It was a very large circular depression in the grass, covered with a gray, ash-like material which they each touched with their fingers and hands. This neighbor, being a local small-town school principal, would not report this finding because he was afraid that he would be fired from his job. I can't remember, but it may have been 20 or 30 years ago. My brother-in-law will have difficulty speaking with you because he has Parkinson's disease, but the more comfortable he becomes, the more you will be able to understand him. My sister may or may not remember as much as her husband. I have always felt this incident was very important to report -- to whom, I didn't know."],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1977 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","Date of the Event":"11/30/1977 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01182008-0033","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.605604"}
