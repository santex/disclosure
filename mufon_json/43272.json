We first thought it was a plane or helicopter, but it made no sound and had no blinking lights. It kept moving towards the south at a constant speed. Just before it was almost over the tree tops a second light came out of the original first light. It kept on going and then turned around and a third light came out of the first light. The three lights then moved off in a triangular formation."],"City":"Grand Cayman","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/15/2012 05:51 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grand Cayman","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
