I noticed an orangey-yellow glowing object in the sky almost directly above me. It was cigar or cylinder shaped and flew without any sound. Its flight was very smooth, as if it were set on a particular course and it seemed to also increase in elevation as it headed toward the horizon. It flew from West to East. It did not have any blinking lights, wings, or trail, and it made no noise what so ever. I am not near any traffic, and no cars were running in the parking lot, so I do not think it possible that noise could have been drowned out."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-95.991368","Log Number":"US-06282010-0017","City":"Omaha"}
