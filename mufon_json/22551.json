{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe blue book version of his sighting is very limited. My father was a fighter pilot stationed on Guam when he had his sighting while flying on mission and made the report. His report is very lengthy so I would appreciate a call from someone if you are interested in the rest of his story. He told us on numerous occasions when prompted by his sons of his sighting with much more detail than the blue book version suggests. If you want an accurate accounting of what he really saw please call anytime. He is now deceased but I would like to see his full story out in the open."],"Region":"Arkansas","City":"Anderson AFB Guam","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Anderson AFB Guam","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22551.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22551.html"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/31/1957 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.207,+-91.830563(22551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22551) map </A>","Summary":"I would like to add information to the Blue Book registered sighting by Lt.
