{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had just returned home from the corner store and noticed a star like object blinking as it soared through the sky. I know it wasn't a shooting star. I looked for several minutes and noticed two more of the same star like objects chasing each other on the opposite side of the sky and their lights were also blinking simultaneously. I ran in the house and asked my son to come verify what I saw, and I guess the look on my face, he knew I meant it. He confirmed what I saw also. This isn't the first time I have seen a UFO.......I also saw one in Flint Michigan when I was 9 years old in 1979, along with my dad. The UFOS knew I was watching them because they would disappear and suddenly reappear and briefly hover. I tried to get a video but it turned out to dark."],"Date Submitted":"11/17/2012 12:12 UTC","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around November 16th 2012"],"Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Starlike objects that were blinking in sequence.
