I was just finishing up. It was a very clear September day. Blue sky, no clouds. As luck would have it, everyone had since gone inside the house leaving me alone. I happened to look upward toward the direction of the North East. At that time I noticed what looked like a flying telephone pole. No wings, no contrails. It appeared to be as high as a small plane could or would fly. I'm guessing about maybe 3000 ft. This object flew from the North East over me in a South Western direction. No sound I could tell. This lasted about 5 min. It went from one horizon to another in that time. I had heard of \"rods\", maybe this was one of them. It was fast, under some kind of direction. It went straight until out of sight. Almost like a \"slow\" moving jet. I was surprised. But maybe not totally suprised, I keep an open mind."],"Latitude":"42.137114","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10102010-0019","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25788.html"],"Summary":"cylinder shaped object flew over with no wings, silent, appeared black. from horizon to horizon.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
