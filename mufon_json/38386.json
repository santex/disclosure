I was able to get a quick picture of it as I was driving. After observing the picture later in the day I noticed something in the top corner of the shot. It looked like an oval shape that didn���t seem to be any type of familiar object. After zooming in to get a better look, it occurred that the object looked similar to a UFO. After viewing the picture a few times I was unable to come to any other conclusion. I believe I captured the image of a UFO passing over RT 3 in Clifton, NJ. I returned to the site several hours later to see if the object was still there but it was gone."],"Summary":"grey/silver oval shaped flying object flying a little over tree level","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.865233,+-74.157955(38386)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38386) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/21/2012 08:15 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","Latitude":"40.865233","Case Number":"38386","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38386.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38386_submitter_file1__securedownload12.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38386_submitter_file2__securedownload1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38386.html"],"Longitude":"-74.157955"}
