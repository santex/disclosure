Lights shifted to the eastern sky. My dad woke me up as he spotted 3 lights moving in the sky. Lights went from 3 to 4 in minutes. We thought it was spotlights but it stayed with our car as we traveled 20 miles and rotated. Lights were still observable outside of the backseat window after the time of 8:05 pm. Started off as 3 lights, rotated and the lights would move close together then spread out about the wingspan of a LARGE plane. Lights rotated into a ball like form then stretched again, cycle repeated. During the sighting we were trying to figure out what it was, after the sighting we were shocked. We lost sight because as we traveled further north then a change of direction to east. In the video the lights appear as blue but as I watched with my eyes they were a white color."],"Object Shape":"Triangle, Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"New Jersey, New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51854.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51854.html"],"Longitude":"-73.830887","trends":["There have been no other sightings in New Jersey, New York","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/26/2013 07:13 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10262013-0020","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.86657,+-73.830887(51854)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51854) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/26/2013 09:13 UTC","Case Number":"51854","Object Features":"None","Region":"New York"}
