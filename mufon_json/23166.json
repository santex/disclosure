(im sure that pilot saw that!!! it was only a few feet high from the top road on spagetti junction\\ hov lane. all of this was in about 3 minutes...by the way we both had our cell phones in our laps and was too shocked, that we didnt realize to take any pictures :( but wonderful experience!!"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Atlanta","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.755485,+-84.379102(23166)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23166) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/06/2010 02:56 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/17/2010 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 95 other sightings in Atlanta","There were no other sightings in Atlanta on or around April 17th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"Round, approx 15-20 lights underneath, gray color with dome.","Case Number":"23166","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05062010-0012","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
