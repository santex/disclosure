The sighting took place in downtown Ann Arbor. My friend looked up and exclaimed, ���What the **** is that?��� He pointed directly upwards to a triangular object who���s three points were each designated by a soft, blue light. The object seemed not to cruise a regular speed, but to sort of float and pivot slightly back and forth, headed in a general northwest direction. The object itself was barely discernible, except the back looked slightly concaved, or fish-tailed. We saw the object floating for about 15 seconds before it disappeared behind the buildings in the city."],"Date Submitted":"03/28/2011 11:53 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/27/2011 11:15 UTC"}
