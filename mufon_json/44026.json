A similar event occurred in October of 2002 in Albany NY; also by the local FOX affiliate there. They were \"shooting\" at the Albany \"International\" Airport when back at the studio, while editting the tape, they saw a finned, missle-like object traveling at an incredible speed. All of the details and video clips of this event at available by Googling the \"Abany UFO 2002\". I sent two e-mails to the Denver Fox affiliate suggesting that they try to encourage a nationwide experiment where video equipment by other FOX affiliates are set up across the country, aimed at sections of the sky and then analyzed for contant, later in the studios at reduced speed. Perhaps a grass-roots effort in this manner can also yield some interesting results! I'm sorry to use this forum for this communication, but I know of no other way to get this message out there to so many like-minded people.
