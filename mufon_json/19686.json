It was summer time just after dusk. I was playing outside when I saw a phosflourescent blue light moving slowly north to south in the sky. It was silent, moving very slowly. I could see the farm house image about a half mile away to the west. It was about half the distance to the farm house and slightly above. I was mesmerized, just staring at it for about 4-5 minutes. It suddenly stopped and stayed in one position. An older neighbor came up to me and asked me what I was doing. All I could think of that could move thru the sky and then stop and stay motionless was a helicoptor. I pointed to the blue light and told him it was a helicoptor. He said it was a star. I was distracted and when I looked up it was gone. Even at 8-9 years old I knew that it wasnt a helicoptor. Since that day I have been extremely observent, open minded and investigative of phenomena."],"Latitude":"43.187248","Case Number":"19686","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19686.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19686.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-84.106465","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"phosflourescence blue round object in sky","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.187248,+-84.106465(19686)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19686) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/27/2009 10:57 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09272009-0021"}
