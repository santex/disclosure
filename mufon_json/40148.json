{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy 5 year old granddaughter was on the deck overlooking the pond at about 8pm when she said look at that red thing, maybe it's Mars. We watched it for awhile and it pulsated a bit then moved very slightly. I dismissed it and we set out to light some fire works. Suddenly I realized it was still there and was now made up of more orange lights, it started to move further east. I got out my binoculars and could see several orange lights, 3 or 4, maybe. It was starting to fade and I saw what looked like search light beams, then it just began to disappear. This morning I ran into my next door neighbors who asked me if I had seen the strange glowing orange ball over the pond. We compared notes and were in complete agreement about what we all had seen."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40148.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40148.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Vinalhaven","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.052623","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"40148","Longitude":"-68.840764","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.052623,+-68.840764(40148)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40148) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07042012-0017","City":"Vinalhaven","Country":"United States","Summary":"We first thought it was a planet about 30 degrees above horizon, maybe Mars because it was reddish orange.but an hour later it was a bit higher, It had ascended and there were more lights.","Region":"Maine","Date Submitted":"07/04/2012 03:09 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City"}
