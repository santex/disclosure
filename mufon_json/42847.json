My roommate and I were outside smoking a cigarette just now when I noticed something in the sky around the moon. It resembled the surrounding stars however it was moving. I took it as either the International Space Station or a Satellite when I was pointing it out to my roommate. However, he was seeing another object which crossed horizontally under the moon while my object was to the right of the moon and much further up. We watched as the objects got out of view and continued smoking our cigarettes while discussing the objects, when all of a sudden a third object came into view. It was flying in the opposite direction as the other two and headed out of view as well. My roommate and I have witnessed these star like UFOs before and it makes me wonder if this is their way of hiding from us until they move. I don't know for sure but it was a pretty amazing experience. I'm not new to the UFO phenomena and I'm sure this won't be the last."],"Case Number":"42847","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42847.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42847.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Groves"}
