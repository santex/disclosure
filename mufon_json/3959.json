I was actually returning to Kansas City at the time from Birmingham, AL, via a 2 hour layover in Houston���s George Bush Intercontinental Airport. It was around 7:15 p.m., and cloudy. I was seated on the left side of the plane, about 4 rows in front of the port wing. The sun was setting on the opposite side of the plane. At that point in time, it was fairly dark outside. There was still some light, but with the cloud cover, it was getting difficult to see. I had been listening to a CD, and was fairly relaxed. Not sleepy, not dreamy, just mellow. We were about 5 miles out from the landing strip when something caught my eye outside. I looked out, and caught a white blur that reminded me of a, well, a Banshee. I know. Weird. I saw it for about a half a second, and it faded out. Probably just a random cloud that had that look. But, it was disturbing. What registered was a figure in white flying head first, keeping pace with the plane. White hair, white clothing, hands stretched out to the front, and curved like claws. But, it was gone. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I was spooked. I kept looking out the window trying to see what it was. I felt like John Lithgow in the Twilight Zone movie. Then, about a minute later, I saw the ���main event��� . I looked back to the wing, and there were four or five solid objects there. They were blue on top, red on bottom, and looked like balloons. They kept pace with us for about 3-5 seconds, then went up and out, away from the plane. (2 or 3 fell straight behind, and one went straight up, one went left and up) I say balloons meaning shaped like that. However, the surface appeared more solid than a baloon. They had the appearance of a firm plastic or fiberglass, and they didn't have the dull appearance of balloons outside. The blue top was larger than the red bottom, and they were separate shapes, yet the appeared attached by yellow cords. Think of an old style hot air balloon, like what Jules Verne would have drawn for Around the World in 80 Days. There wasn't any space or separation between the top and bottom half. The cords wrapped from top to bottom. I watched them long enough to see them, determine their color, and then watch them go away. I was really, really bugged by that time. Visibly shaken. After we landed, I waited by the plane door for my bag (I���d gate checked it). After people stopped exiting the plane, I had a conversation with the pilot. Here���s that conversation: ���Sir, I���ve got a question for you.��� ���Yeah, go ahead.��� ���This sounds weird, but did we fly through anything on the way in.��� ���No, we didn���t. Why?��� ���Well, nothing like birds or anything?��� ���No. What did you see?��� ���Well, I was wondering if we flew through some objects about a mile out, right before the runway.��� ���Oh. Oh. Those. Yeah, we did fly through some things. Balloons. There were a few birds there, too. Nothing to worry about. Somebody probably let them go and lost a bunch of them.��� ���OK. Those were balloons?��� ���yeah, they were red and blue, right?��� ���Yep, that���s what I saw.��� ���OK. Yeah, they were balloons. I called the tower to let them know they were there. Don���t worry, I saw them too.��� At this point, I was thinking, whew, just balloons. But, then it got weird. I said, ���I���m glad. I thought I was going nuts. No one else in the plane saw them that I could tell.��� ���Then I���m nuts too, because apparently, we���re the only two that did. My co-pilot didn���t see them.��� ���Really? OK. So, were they close enough to get pulled into our ���vacuum��� as we passed by, and kind of follow us?��� ���No, they were about 500 feet away from the plane, there wasn���t any danger.��� ���Oh. OK. Thanks. I���ll see ya later then.��� Suddenly, my brain kicked into full gear. I turned and walked away. Regular balloons, 500 feet away, at twilight. There���s no way, not even if the Devil is ice-skating, that I could have seen regular 12��� balloons, 500 feet away, at twilight, and seen the colors. He lied to me. The pilot could probably see that I was somewhat disturbed by what had happened, and he was trying to cajole me. He even managed to eat at the same place that I did in the airport and sit facing me. I walked into the airport, and found that there were about 6 restaurant areas. I picked one, went to a table, and then noticed that the pilot was there as well. He was definitely watching me. I saw something that night. I���m not sure what, but it was ���something���. Every time I think about this, I doubt what I saw. Then I remember the pilot and what he said. He saw them too. Then he lied."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Observed 4-5 objects approx. 2 ft dia. x 2 ft high at port/left side of aircraft, between wing and my seat","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.763193,+-95.36794(3959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3959) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10062005-0003","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less"}
