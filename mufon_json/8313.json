I looked out my window and saw a Saturn shaped object in the sky. The ball in the middle was glowing yellow and there was a red ring going around it. I knew they were attached, because they were moving together. The object was slowly hovering forward. I did not see any aliens. It went behind a tree and then it disappeared."],"Log Number":"US-11102007-0002","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Woodbridge Township","There were no other sightings in Woodbridge Township on or around August 16th 2007"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Saturn looking object","Case Number":"8313","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Saturn-like","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Woodbridge Township","Date of the Event":"08/16/2007 07:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8313.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8313.html"],"Region":"New Jersey","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-74.32237","Date Submitted":"08/16/2007 07:45 UTC","Country":"United States"}
