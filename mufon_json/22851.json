It was around 11:30am when the photo was taken. When I arrived home and was renaming the picture for my files, I noticed a strange object above the roof of the home. I tried to zoom in and was not able to make out what the object was. It has an orange color to it. My son said it was probably a butterfly but in relationship to the size of the home that didn't seem to make sense. It may be nothing but I thought it would be wise to have some expert eyes check it out."],"Longitude":"-80.586755","Case Number":"22851","City":"Palm Bay","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Noticed after taking picture of a home I was selling","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.039272,+-80.586755(22851)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22851) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Palm Bay","There were no other sightings in Palm Bay on or around February 21st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
