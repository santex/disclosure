{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were watching fireworks from my friends yard, 4 of us. And saw the first orange glowing sphere quickly moving from South to North. No sound, constant, steady, and fast. Appeared quite high...then 2 more followed, each a few minutes apart. My friend and I were both able to capture the last one on video from our phones. None of us could determine what it might be. It faded off into the horizon, beyond our sight."],"Latitude":"40.31337","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-88.97369","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:00 UTC","Summary":"Three different orange glowing spheres on same flight pattern, minutes apart","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:08:00","Log Number":"US-07052013-0085","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Heyworth","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.31337,+-88.97369(48711)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48711) map </A>","Case Number":"48711","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 11:32 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Heyworth","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48711.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48711.html"]}
