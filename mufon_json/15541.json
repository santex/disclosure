{"Latitude":"41.571441","Case Number":"15541","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"02/16/2009 06:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Saw a bright light in the sky around 6pm and it keeps dissappearing, and there have been planes flying near the site all night.","divs":["sighting detailsthis is my second time reporting this to mufon, but there is definately something going on in my own backyard, whenever my family and i see these paticular lights it is usually around the same time each time between 6pm and 6:15pm and ends around 11pm and 1pm or maybe longer. this light is very brilliant and i have ruled out that it is a planet or some type of satelite etc; we see this brilliant beautiful sparkling light that changes colors and appears to move just slightly. please note this is the 3rd time we have seen these lights and each time, especially tonight, we saw multiple planes\\jets flying near and around its path, once planes got closer the object seemed to disappear before, but tonight we decided to do a little more investigation and we wanted to get in the car and drive to get a better clearer look, when to our surprise once we got into the object was in the front of our home instead of in back, we were assuming before that it was disappearing when in actuality it was moving to the front as soon as the planes attempted to get closer. also tonight was more amazing than the previous times we had seen the object, because we actually saw the object do a zig zag type of movement when the planes\\jets get closer. never in my life have i seen at least 4 planes\\jets near each other trying to get near this thing!!!! it was so hard to believe we were actually watching this happen. then all of a sudden another light came from behind the trees and appeared to be rising and we thought it may be another jet but it was going so fast and rising from a very low point. it was going at a rapid speed and i tried to follow it with binoculars but couldn't keep up. but what i did see was a bright light gliding up and it didn't have any type of wing span and then all of a sudden it just too off!! i want to cal someone so bad to ask what is going on with all these planes surrounding this thing, but i don't know who to contact to see if in fact the planes\\jets are chasing something or trying to get a better view of what is going on, but i have no idea who to call about this at all without sounding crazy, any suggestions? it seems like the objects are coming more often now, and there is still the mystery of the strange footprints that were in our back yard in late december and early january."],"Date Submitted":"02/16/2009 06:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.571441,+-72.648889(15541)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15541) map </A>","City":"Middletown","Sighting Duration":"07:00:00","Longitude":"-72.648889","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15541.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15541.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Middletown","There were no other sightings in Middletown on or around February 16th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Diamond, Triangle","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02172009-0003","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Connecticut","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
