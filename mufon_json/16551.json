{"divs":["sighting detailslast night around 9:15 , i happened to look out my window .i'm on the 6 floor and have a perfect view of downtown knoxville and the river . coming up the river from west to east was what i first thought was a plane . it had strobing lights on both ends and a bright light in the center . as it passed over the building , it had no tail section and was completly silent . the altitude was probably around 200 feet or less . and its length was somewhere between 50 and 75 feet acrost , between the strobing lights . the total time of viewing it was maybe 6 secounds . when i first spotted it , it was about a half to three quarters of a mile away . the secound thing i saw was a white ball of light around 10 pm . about 30 degress above the horizion . traveling north to south , it was about 1\\8 of an inch in diamater . and really moving speed wise it went from right to left in about a secound or two . i dont have any sat trak programs anymore so maybe it was a satilight . the distance from me to the object is unknown . i sure would like to know if anyone else saw these objects last night ."],"Object Shape":"Disc, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16551.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16551.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-83.915429","Latitude":"35.961788","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/16/2009 09:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:06","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04172009-0010","Case Number":"16551","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around April 16th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"04/16/2009 09:15 UTC","Region":"Tennessee","Summary":"More sightings over the Tennessee River.","City":"Knoxville","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.961788,+-83.915429(16551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16551) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
