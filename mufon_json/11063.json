I know full what a helicopter or plane look and sound like. I have seen tons of meteors when I lived Arizona for 8 years. This was neither. It was a very large and extremely bright white orb moving slowly in a southeastern direction, seemingly at a very high altitude. In fact, you may start receiving reports from downtown, the southern side of Chicago, and in Indiana shortly. I have never seen anything like it. It was completely silent, and moved slowly and smoothly. It was at a very high altitude, so the size of this thing was astonishing. It was heading into a southeastern direction. There was no trailer, no flashing lights, and it was brighter than the moon. My theory is that it was an un-manned orb used for surveillance as I have read up on bases like Dulce, Ant Hill & Area 51. It was approximately 2.5 miles southeast of O'Hare Airport, so the radar had to pick it up for sure."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"11063","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11063.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11063.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"It was a very large and extremely bright white orb moving slowly in a southeastern direction.","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","City":"Chicago","Date Submitted":"06/06/2008 09:22 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"41.886634","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around June 6th 2008"],"Date of the Event":"06/06/2008 09:22 UTC","Longitude":"-87.628278","Disposition":"Unknown"}
