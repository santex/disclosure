[name removed\\cms\\tg] also lived a few blocks from me on mable street. all my life this has bothered me and of course, i don't really tell anyone because i don't want them to think i'm nuts but i saw something and it wasn't normal; it was not the sun; it was not a plane. i don't know what it was. when i first saw the object i was a little frightened or maybe surprised and then later excited as i went for the camera and finally disappointed when it was gone. i felt sad it was gone. sad as if my best friend moved or something. as an adult, looking back, i feel i lost time but i have no other memory of the event. i've looked on the internet to see if anyone else saw this but i have not been successful."],"Summary":"Bright yellow/white disk/oval over house, hovering.","Country":"United States","Region":"Iowa","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Ottumwa","There were no other sightings in Ottumwa on or around May 31st 1974"],"Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"41.02124","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-92.413773","Date of the Event":"05/31/1974 02:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.02124,+-92.413773(24566)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24566) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/16/2010 06:56 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"24566","Source":"MUFON"}
