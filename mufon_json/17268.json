I noticed what I thought was a plane coming toward me. I watch it until it went behind a house. A few seconds later it came back out from behind the house but it was glowing red now. Before it was a bright blueish white light. It seemed to be stayig in one general location. I kept losing it in the trees and behind the house. It would make very fast movements and would change direction like fireworks would. This went on for about 20 minutes or so. I just can't think of anything this might be. If you have a idea of what it was please let me know."],"Case Number":"17268","Weather Factors":"Windy","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17268.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17268.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/30/2009 11:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
