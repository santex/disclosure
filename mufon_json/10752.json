My car was facing north. They were moving from the west to the east, and slowly pulsating vibrant red. They would occiasionally move forwards in small intervals and then stop. One light completely disappeared and then the three remaining lights formed a straight line. Then two of the lights began to head towards each other and suddenly one stopped and made a 90 degree turn and shot upward at an incredible rate and then disappeared. The two remain lights stopped moving and then faded out."],"Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around May 14th 2008"],"Case Number":"10752"}
