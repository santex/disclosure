About midday I went out on the loading dock for a short break, I noticed a bird gliding overhead and I decided to see if I could take a picture of it. After a few days I uploaded the picture to my computer. While looking at the picture I noticed something above the bird, which I didn't notice while taking the picture. I zoomed in to get a closer look, and it appears to be a UFO. See Attached Photos. 1. Origianl 2. 1:1 3. Cropped and Zoomed"],"Country":"United States"}
