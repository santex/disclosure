I closed my door and like always, gazed up into the stars and ponder about the wonders of the universe in that short time gap between my car and the garage. But, in this short journey to the warmth of my home from the winter night, some bizarre happened that I've never seen before. Not, I've seen many a shooting star in my life for I have grown up in the Montana country, and have seen this phenomena a few times. This time it was different. Same characteristics as a shooting star, just appeared went into its trajectory, then disappeared. But instead of a distant luminous light orb like a star, it seemed closer and like a vehicle. It happened so fast the only familiar aircraft shape I could compare it too is the Stealth fighter. Hope this helps, thanks"],"Object Features":"Other","Region":"Montana","Date of the Event":"01/05/2013 02:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Diamond","Summary":"Fast, looked like vehicle, as quick as a shooting star.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.80888,+-108.534469(45030)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45030) map </A>","City":"Billings","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/05/2013 05:08 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01052013-0002","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Billings","There were no other sightings in Billings on or around January 5th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45030.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45030.html"],"Latitude":"45.80888","Case Number":"45030"}
