{"divs":["Sighting Detailsme and my 2 friends were sky watching on st.pete beach when we didnt c anything we started to look Down and our breaths were taken away as we saw this blue orb coming towards the beach and it stoped just above where the waves were breaking on the shoreline and as we looked underneath it we saw this small almost glass like child sized figure and it paced the beach for about 15 yards till one of us spoke to see if the others were seeing it and it froze where it was and looked at us and the hole time the orb was above it... But as we saw it turn towards our direction the orb strobes 3 times so bright that it was unbelievable and after the light it was just gone... And we were scared shitless, we sprinted all the way to my car and went straight home & I never remember running that fast in my entire life."],"Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-82.6368","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/23/2011 11:11 UTC","Case Number":"37180","Summary":"mentally striking and unknowingly frightening","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in St Petersburg","There was one other sighting in St Petersburg on or around August 23rd 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.776216,+-82.6368(37180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37180) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"04/07/2012 03:13 UTC","City":"St Petersburg","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"27.776216","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37180.html"],"Log Number":"US-04072012-0013","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
