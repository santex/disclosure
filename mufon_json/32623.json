I thought at first it was three small planes with white lights that were doing a fly over at the KC Chiefs stadium. I saw them on two different nights on the way home from work in the same location. They flew very close to each other and were flying fairly erratically and within a circumference of about five miles. They would double back around for an additional fly over in the general area of the stadiums. I have been a solo pilot for many years and thought that the maneuvers they were doing were very risky. I didn't say anything to anyone about this and I was alone. Since I was driving on the hi way I couldn't stop but I really wanted to. This morning in Church our Pastor said something about the unusual lights in the sky earlier this month and it dawned on me that I saw these lights too!"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/16/2011 12:55 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 9 other sightings in Kansas City on or around October 3rd 2011"]}
