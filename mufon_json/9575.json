He saw a group of lights and pointed them out to me. They were moving slowly and low in the sky. I knew right away these were not planes. There were two groups of four bright white lights, in a straight line, one larger group above the other smaller group, similar to the shape of the ship on Star Trek. The entire group slowly turned to the right, then split into two separate groups, each a group of four bright white lights with a red light underneath. The two groups slowly passed over us and continued on toward the southeast until out of sight. There was no noise at all, completely silent. I am sure that it was not airplanes or a blimp. I tried to take photographs, but wasn't sure if I was getting anything because it was so dark. When we looked at our pictures later, I was shocked to find not only the two groups I was focusing on, but three more groups of different colors in the photo as well. In the photo they appear zig-zagging, but they did not look like this by plain eyesight. I was amazed, excited, and nervous. I could not believe what I was seeing. Also, I circled three lights in the lower right hand corner of each photograph. I don't know what these are, but they are the same in each photo. They are not zig zagged like the others. The photos were taken less than a minute apart. Witness 2: It was around 9:00 pm, and my girlfriend and I were on the way to my house from the high school baseball game. We were driving north down the road and I noticed some strange lights in the sky to my left. I told her to look and she was surprised too. There were four white lights and a red light. The four white lights blinked in a rolling sequence and the red light did not blink at all. I am sure they could not have been planes because they were too close together and were moving very slowly and I could not hear anything. They were low enough that I should have been able to hear something. As they moved along, it seems that the red light was moving ahead of the white lights. I have never seen anything like this."],"Object Features":"None","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"32.767296","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
