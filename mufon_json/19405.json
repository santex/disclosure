The object was a bright white lit trapezoid shape shorter on the top. it was stationary in the sky. below the object was a fog like substance which was illuminated by the white light. the object did not move nor did the fog seem to be moving away as if it was a rocket. there was no sound from that direction. the sky was star lit with no moon and there was no ground fog or clouds. the light suddenly stopped but the fog seemed to be glowing white for a while after. there was no wind and still no sound. None of us had ever seen anything like it before. It was not like a fireworks display but more like someone standing on a 1 mile high ladder with a bright white flash light shinning it down on a small patch of fog. There is no reason for this type of light in the sky because there is really nothing in the direction we were looking."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
