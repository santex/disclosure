it was so . . . pure it was too early for a star to be this bright. even venus was dim because there was light in the sky still. this was as pure brightness and a color of light i had never seen. as it moved across the sky it was unworldly in its movement. by that i mean unlike any aircraft we know today. not like a plane or even a high flying jet aircraft. they all move with a worldly rhythm but this moved so effortlessly across the sky at a pace that is not of this planet. it glided without movement or turbulence of any kind and the brightness of the light never wavered. it stayed beautiful and bright throughout the course of it's flight until it went out of our vision. it moved from west to east and it was silent and perfect! no sound came from this celestial at all. i ran from one yard to another yard to follow the flight path and i tried videotaping it but i could not capture it. i'll look again but it was dark on camera. i know something big is happening. it just falls into place with what i know is occurring with the planets. my psychic ability tells me that we are in a transformation for all the human race but now i realize this is on a much larger scale than even i had foreseen. i am still in awe and i know this is not just another sighting, i just know that. seeing something move across the sky is one thing; watching a diamond craft\\celestial enter our airspace, and come to a halt like it did with such ease is another. maybe it didn't know, or care, that i saw it enter but it wanted us\\me to see it later that evening. it was clear and not fuzzy, it was close and not far away although i cannot tell the size from its flight. it looked huge when it entered the portal early morning but much smaller when we saw it later. i\\we saw it clearly and it was, for lack of better words, beautifully perfect."],"Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
