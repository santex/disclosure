{"City":"Salt Lick","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Summary":"Bright sphere of light in the northern sky passing east to west","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Salt Lick","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"10384","divs":["sighting detailslast night around 10:30 or so, i had taken our dog out. as normal, i stood on the porch and tried to count the number of planes that i could see in the sky (we recently moved to this location where there is a very good view of the sky in several directions compared to where we had lived and you could only see the sky immediately overhead)...it struck me as odd that i couldn't see any this time. then i looked to the north-east and notice a bright light that i at first thought was a low-flying plane...i wasn't able to get a good view at that time as it was being blocked by trees. after it came out from behind the tree line, i noticed that i was now looking at it from a side angle and the light was just as intese from this direction. i watched it continue it trek toward the west until it was behind the house. at that point, i went into the back-yard and continue to watch it. i called for my wife to verify that i was seeing something out of the norm. now, the view was the rear of the \"craft\" (for lack of better word), and again, the light intensity was the same. i continued to watch it until it was out of site. afterwards the realization of what just occured hit me and i realized that not once did i see any of the required strobe lights, nor, did i hear any sound either from a plane and\\or a helicoptor. i also noticed that at no point during this did i see any other planes around. it was just surreal. several moments after it passed out of sight, i then noticed that there were 3 or 4 planes flying through, all of which were easily identified as a plane because even though they were definately flying at a higher altitude, but, you could clearly make out the red and blue strobing lights. i have spoken to a good friend of mine who stated that it could have been the space station, but, this appeared to be much closer...at this point, i have no clue what i saw. i remain somewhat skeptical, but, i guess what i saw was a ufo in it's truest sense in the fact that i can identify what it was."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/16/2008 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.120081","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.120081,+-83.614635(10384)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10384) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10384.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10384.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10384.html"],"Longitude":"-83.614635","Date of the Event":"04/16/2008 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-04172008-0009","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Kentucky"}
