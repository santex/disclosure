{"Log Number":"US-11262009-0016","Region":"Colorado","divs":["Sighting DetailsI lived about three miles from the mountains on the western side of Fort Collins. I was sitting outside facing south, toward Loveland when I noticed a bright light in the sky. I thought at first a plane of course, but then I noticed three helicopters rising up toward this light, it stayed a few minutes then shot upward. I even got my husband and son to come out and look at it as none of us had ever seen something like this."],"City":"Fort Collins","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/26/2009 07:59 UTC","Latitude":"40.58866","Longitude":"-105.081923","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"I saw a bright oval shape in the sky.","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/30/1989 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Fort Collins","There were no other sightings in Fort Collins on or around June 30th 1989"],"Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"20744","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.58866,+-105.081923(20744)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20744) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20744.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20744.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
