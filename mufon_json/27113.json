the others were about 100 feet away for safety. there was one fairly bright street light just off to one side and behind us. at the end of the final launch, the whole of which took about 10 minutes, one of our girls called out something to the likes of... ��� oh, what are those���. we all looked up to the back-side sky, partly obscured by the streetlight. it helped to block the streetlight with, say, one���s hand, in order to see the objects better, at least from my own point of view. there, we all witnessed what i can only describe as glowing colors, changing from copper-red, to golden hues, orbs. their size was roughly 10 times the diameter of jupiter (as it has been lately), though not as bright. they were not spectacularly bright, nor were they dull; (like amber highway lights about 15 poles distant). if there had been any clear shape patterns\\or distortions they would have been noticed. the shapes did not change much, basically oval\\spherical. we estimated (the pilots jumped in to help) the distances to be roughly 1 to 2 kilometers away at elevations of about 2000-3000 feet or so, angled about 40 degrees with the horizon. a couple of us had seen what was most likely a plane passing far overhead and above them, at perhaps 10,000 feet. however, we focused on the two orbs. they were very clearly visible and well below any cloud mist. i quickly asked if anyone had brought with them a camera. no one answered to the affirmative, even though we had many cameras back at the house, a block away. nonetheless, my niece had indeed brought her old cell-phone camera and had tried to snap a picture; she and her companion reported that the picture did not register, either believing that there was not enough light or that she was not able to get the objects into focus within the short time they presented themselves to us. the orbs were present for only about 3 minutes, from the time we first discovered them... they may have been there longer, but not observed. the orbs were moving in a roughly north-easterly direction, and slowly. they made no sound that anyone could hear. we were looking at them and they were traveling in our direction, at first. it was shortly after the fireworks show that we first noticed them. within the subsequent 1st minute, the orb at the left appeared to come to a stop, and did not change its brightness, except for the color changes (about one full cycle per 3 seconds). the second varied at what appeared to be the same rate. the variation transitioned smoothly\\continuously, not in an abrupt off-on manner. the orb on the right was at first about the width of 2-3 fingers apart (held at arms length) from the orb on the left. it appeared to brighten until it roughly matched that of the left orb. it then started to move forward as the other remained put, after first hesitating. it made a bending pattern movement and came around much closer to the left orb. i thought at one instant that it was going to connect up with the other, but it came instead to within a distance of about one finger width away (at arms length). at that point it stayed put and the left orb slowly moved in a new direction to the south-east. shortly afterword, the second orb slowly started to move in the same direction, following. both went on their way into the distance and faded out of sight within the 3rd-4th minutes. it really appeared to all of us that these objects had been observing us and only changed direction after having noticed that our show was over, or that they had been discovered. in discussing with the pilots, they decided to call in to their professional connections to see if any planes were in the area at this level, that might explain the observations. two calls were made, with no confirmations of any such low flights. we conjectured: none of the lights were typical of any known plane standards, that the pilots could think of. there were no sounds at all, if one were to consider helicopters in the area, as a cause. this amazing coincidence of two objects seemingly communicating with each other, on christmas evening, at this hour, was very unusual. in particular, the coincidence of our lighting fireworks (or anyone doing so on this day), and the timing of the orbs seems inexplicable. their change in direction within a minute of our observing them is equally uncanny; they seemed to be watching us. the transitioning lights were not beams of light shining down onto the earth nor into the sky��� no traces in the slightly misty air. the 'entire' objects were clearly illuminated as opposed to lights on the objects��� this is unusual. and finally the most unusual coincidence of all. i had been, early in the same day, looking back at digital pictures i'd taken two years ago in northern newfoundland, of what i was curiously suspecting might be a ufo. i'd taken 3 high resolution pictures of this but had never gone back to study them. i showed these to my daughters this same day, and we guessed, in the end, that the object in this case, was more likely an unusual weather balloon ������dirigible that had a shape ���resembling a dragon���. next, just before i showed up to light the fireworks, (the others arrived at the clearing 5 minutes before me), my daughter was explaining to one of the pilots there about the story of those other pictures. they were joking about it all��� and then, this new experience occurred. also, one of the fireworks pieces was called 'alien invasion' and my wife was calling out to bring on the aliens, in gesture only. very weird indeed. all this was a very real experience that can be confirmed by all present. the three children were unfortunately quite upset and frightened by the sighting. it took us a few hours to calm them afterwards and convince them of an alternate acceptable explanation for all this. sincerely *(wit's name and identifying information deleted -- cms\\sg)."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-12262010-0005","City":"Hudson","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hudson","There were no other sightings in Hudson on or around December 25th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"45.451763","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.451763,+-74.146091(27113)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27113) map </A>"}
