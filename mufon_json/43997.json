(this was at about 1:30, halfway through the event). i get everything inside and up until about 3:30 was still peeking out the window to see if it was still there, and it was. the object seems to appear randomly but fairly frequently, and seems to be at some point identifiably in the sky every tuesday and has since the tuesday before election day."],"Log Number":"US-11182012-0007","Region":"Colorado","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Sphere","Longitude":"-104.99794","City":"Denver","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"43997","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"39.822377","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/17/2012 11:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
