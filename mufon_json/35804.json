I was facing east taking sunrise photos then turned to the west to get a shot of the buildings lining the shore and the harbor from our place at the end of the dock. When I downloaded my pictures just now, I noticed in that one shot what looks like a vertical contrail and, below it, a round shape with two rectangular lights. (Neither of us witnessed this prior to seeing it in the photograph.) Of course, the shot becomes pixilated when enlarged but it's clear enough that we can both say we've not seen anything like it before. And, it's not at all similar to UFO's we've seen pictures of in the past. Please note: I checked the other photos I took to see if there was something on my lens that could have caused that image but on no other pictures did that appear."],"Date Submitted":"02/14/2012 03:26 UTC","Log Number":"US-02142012-0013","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Plymouth","There were no other sightings in Plymouth on or around February 14th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"35804","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.964026,+-70.658252(35804)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35804) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Massachusetts"}
