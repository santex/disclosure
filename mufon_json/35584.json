{"Region":"Alabama","Tags":"City","Case Number":"35584","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsFor the second night my family and I have watched a cluster of pinpoint lights with one light moving around within the cluster. I was able to capture the one pinpoint light that moved on my cell phone movie camera but the cluster is not as bright as the one that moves so the cluster does not show. I live in Huntsville, Al. 35803. Tonight it was almost directly overhead west of the milky way. This is not in earth���s atmosphere. It is out in space."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/09/2012 06:45 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/09/2012 08:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.581404","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02092012-0011","Viewing Distance":"N/A","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35584.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35584.html"],"trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Huntsville","There were no other sightings in Huntsville on or around February 9th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.737719,+-86.581404(35584)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35584) map </A>","Latitude":"34.737719","City":"Huntsville","Summary":"For the second night my family and I have watched a cluster of pinpoint lights with one light moving around within the cluster."}
