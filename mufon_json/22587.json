Im starting to feel like a broken record here. This time they came on in in a row of 4-5 lights but quickly faded out within' a few seconds. Then they came on a 2nd time this time it looked more like a triangle and the lights were all red when it was in the formation of a triangle. If I had to quest i'd say the from each point of the triangle was at least a mile long. so im assuming if my math is correct it had a diameter of 3 miles? Not sure if triangles have a diameter but you know what I mean. It was once again the south east of Abilene."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.451716,+-99.726974(22587)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22587) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"03/31/2010 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-04012010-0002","Summary":"Two Nights in a row of strange Amber/Red/Orange lights","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22587.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22587.html"],"trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were 2 other sightings in Abilene on or around March 31st 2010"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"22587","Longitude":"-99.726974","Source":"MUFON","City":"Abilene","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"04/01/2010 12:24 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other"}
