{"Case Number":"11256","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning, then I saw two lights on the sky. I first realize the two lights as helicopters, but when I looked at them a few moments, i couldn't exactly define it as human objects. Later, I tried to identify which object they could be. When I looked at them closer, they blinked in an evenly way. I wanted to record the objects with a camera, but at first I didn't know exactly, if there are UFO's. In the end it was too late. They flew away and leaved a bright glimming veil on the sky. I didn't actually knot, if there were unknowing flying objects at all, but one thing I can say. If there weren't human produced flying objects, what else they can actually be?..."],"Log Number":"DE-06212008-0009","Summary":"Two undefinable lights on the sky","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11256.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11256.html"],"Country":"Germany","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.711683,+7.104733(11256)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11256) map </A>","Latitude":"50.711683","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Longitude":"7.104733","Date of the Event":"06/19/2008 02:24 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/19/2008 02:24 UTC","Region":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bonn","There were no other sightings in Bonn on or around June 19th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Blimp","City":"Bonn"}
