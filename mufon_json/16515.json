I was using a kodak camera. This went on for about an hour and fifthteen minuets at which time it then started having red, yellow and green lights going round and round and then it became dimmer and just disappeared ( did not fly away ) just disappeared has never been there before this night and has not been back."],"Case Number":"16515","trends":["There have been 105 other sightings in Tampa","There were no other sightings in Tampa on or around March 16th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16515_submitter_file1__100_3239.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16515_submitter_file2__100_3239-ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16515_submitter_file3__100_3240.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16515.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04152009-0005","Region":"Florida","City":"Tampa","Latitude":"27.953935","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Summary":"Brightly lite disc shaped object.","Object Features":"Window(s)","Longitude":"-82.451578","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/16/2009 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
