I witnessed a ball of light (white) about the size of basketball head down in a slight downward angle toward the ground about 30-50ft in the air across the road I was traveling about 100-150ft in font of us. The light got bigger as well as brighter and as it crossed the road and all of a sudden it vanished. As it initially shocked me I said \"Wholly (Bad word)\" and I thought I was the only one to see it but my mother who was also in the car seen it as well because she said what the hell was that. We continued to drive in that direction wondering if it was a plane or something that went down but scene nothing. Not actually sure what it was."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/31/2012 07:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43632.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43632.html"],"Longitude":"-71.189829","Summary":"Light crossed road infront of car on decent appearing to grow in size before disapearing","Case Number":"43632","Date Submitted":"10/31/2012 09:18 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Latitude":"42.730455","Region":"Massachusetts","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.730455,+-71.189829(43632)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43632) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10312012-0010","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
