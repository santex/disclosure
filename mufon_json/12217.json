It was too bright and bigger than the usual star size (from what we can see here). The light stood completely static for about 20 min. and when I decided to look again it was completely gone. It had not moved anywhere as we were on a rooftop and we had a clear view of the horizon. It was static and then vanished. I believe this was a sighting (and my first one - that I recall)."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"Puerto Rico","Region":"","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/11/2008 07:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12217.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12217.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in San Juan","There were no other sightings in San Juan on or around August 11th 2008"],"Case Number":"12217","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.471094,+-66.099422(12217)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12217) map </A>"}
