It didnt make a sound, it was like a white V flying backwards. You know how you see birds flying, it was oposite of that. There was no engine sound or anything and it looked like a white boomerang but alot bigger, the size of mabey a sesna plane. As far as I know, nobody has a plane that doesnt make a sound and flies backwards and if the government is building these wierd things they should tell the citizens so we dont freak out thinking its not from this world..we didnt see it again we ran in and told my mom whom we were visiting, she lives in Cali, we live in Texas, that we saw a UFO but she seemed extremely uninterested of course I dont blame her."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/13/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
