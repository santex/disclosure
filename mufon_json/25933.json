There was no one else on the road at all. All of the sudden, a bright flashing square came out of no where. I pulled over and watched it for about 30 minutes. It eventually came down to about 20 feet from the ground. It changed colors rapidly. It zig-zagged left to right for a long time. Sort of putting on a show for me. It then zoomed off faster than anything I have ever seen. This was most certainly not a plane. It was very strange."],"Case Number":"25933","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Houma","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/16/2010 08:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"29.60236","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Houma","There were no other sightings in Houma on or around October 15th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25933.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25933.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.60236,+-90.716545(25933)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25933) map </A>","Summary":"Flashing square","Country":"United States","Region":"Louisiana","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular"}
