I kept watching these objects when the one on the left veered off towards the east. I looked back and couldn't see the other one, so I kept watching the one headed east. Then it just disappeared. There was an airplane flying south, about the time this happened. It was 6:05 and I called my mom and as I was describing what was happening that was when the one heading east disappeared. No sound or trials came from these objects. They were brighter orange in the center with a more of a bright yellow edge. I hope I am describing this right! It was so crazy to see. Even though they looked close together, they were probably a mile? apart from each other."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-12102012-0007","Tags":"City","Case Number":"44438","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.569127,+-82.912347(44438)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44438) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/10/2012 03:23 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Charter Township of Clinton","There were no other sightings in Charter Township of Clinton on or around December 5th 2012"],"Latitude":"42.569127"}
