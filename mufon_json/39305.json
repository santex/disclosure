He was leaving for work when he saw it. He noticed the bright light and the movement. He didn't know but living near an airport we see a lot of aircraft at all hours. This was way too big and was pure white and too fast and quiet. An aircraft that big would have been slower and loud and the marker and warning lights would have been visible. It was just a white orb, really bright and it seemed round. He was confused as to what he saw. He has never been a believer in UFOs or life on other planets. He certainly didn't believe he would ever see such a thing but there it was. And he had the presents of mind to take a picture before it disappeared behind the horizon line."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.522363","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Iowa","City":"Des Moines","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Des Moines","There were no other sightings in Des Moines on or around June 4th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06122012-0020","Date of the Event":"06/04/2012 04:16 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-93.650924","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"39305","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
