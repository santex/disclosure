{"divs":["sighting detailsi was working as a flight instructor and i was with a student on a navigation training flight. we were about 5 miles south of the chesapeake bay bridge heading sw towards bowie at around 10 am. the weather was clear and chilly with very little wind. this was the last leg of the trip and we had descended to 2500 feet and my student was doing well so there was very little for me to do except to help watch for traffic. i noticed traffic, approximately over baltimore, at around 7,000 feet. i'm guessing the angle of elevation was around 60 degrees. it's hard to say for sure what its altitude was because i couldn't make out any shape to tell what it was to help judge distance. it was just a small gray blob; about 1\\8 inch at arms length. i pointed it out to my student and he acknowledged it. it was no factor to us and he paid no further attention to it. but i was curious because it didn't seem to be moving and so i kept track of it. on occasion there was a glint of sunlight reflecting from it. i was puzzled because helicopters don't often fly that high and if they do they don't hover. i gawked at it and wondered what they were doing. occasionally it would move a small amount very abruptly, or go up or down just slightly. i didn't think this apparent small amount of motion was due to any atmospheric condition, so it just made me more curious. about 5 minutes into this observation, as i was watching it and wondering what those guys were doing, it shot straight up so fast that i couldn't really track it with my eyes. it was out of sight very quickly. it didn't accelerate, it was just instantly going very fast and i know helicopters can't do that. i don't know of anything that can. this object made no smoke, left no kind of vapor trail, and i looked for a contrail above where it was and never saw one. i am certain that this object was not \"flying\", as in any kind of aerodynamic process, so the term ufo isn't accurate. i don't recall the name of the student that was with me and i don't know if anyone else witnessed this thing or not."],"Date Submitted":"09/30/1975 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Observed object hovering for about 5 min, then it shot straight up very fast","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.296065,+-76.608679(13748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13748) map </A>","City":"Baltimore","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"13748","Log Number":"US-11162008-0005","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13748.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13748.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/30/1975 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Maryland","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere, Unknown","Latitude":"39.296065","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-76.608679","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Baltimore","There were no other sightings in Baltimore on or around September 30th 1975"]}
