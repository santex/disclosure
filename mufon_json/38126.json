No sound or shape what so ever, just the strobing light. got to about the Hartford area in 5 seconds and took an abrupt right turn towards the South and it was out of range in less than 8 seconds total. It was not the flashing towers in Plainville and it wasn't a plane. Im planning on making a full report tomorrow."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38126.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Strobing lights flew at very high speed across Bristol and took a right turn towards the south","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05132012-0021","Longitude":"-72.94224","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.676055,+-72.94224(38126)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38126) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
