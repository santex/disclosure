I also always look at the stars. This one night I happen to look straight up checking out the milkyway. Just then I noticed a small object. I thought it was a satelite going from east to west. It was yellow but darker more like a tan color. It was oval in shape. As I watched it going past the milkyway it sudenly lit up like it was burning up in the atmosphere. Then just as sudenly it stopped burning all the wile still moving. It started to fade away as it moved. It lasted about 16 seconds with the burn about 8 seconds in. I went in to call my son. He came out but it was still gone. He laughed at me and went in. I was still looking when It faintly came back into view down rang. The object didn't stay long dimming out again in about 6 second with no fire this time. It never changed coarse. I have a feeling it was a larg meteor that didn't make it into the attmosphere. Never heard any other news about it."],"Longitude":"-74.192409","Latitude":"39.961409","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Toms River","There was one other sighting in Toms River on or around May 21st 2009"],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"05/21/2009 11:30 UTC","Summary":"high object with fireball"}
