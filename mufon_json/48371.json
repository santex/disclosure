Sitting in the back yard facing the east. An odd yellowish light caught my eye as it moved quickly off to the northeast. Odd in the that color was that of a \"camp fire\" only brighter. Not the red, green or white lights of an aircraft. I looked directly overhead and saw 2 more, one behind the other, following the same path as the first. I looked to the southwest and saw 2 more approaching the tree tops from that direction. I ran in the house to get my binoculars, which took maybe 30 seconds. Upon my return, those 2 were overhead with 2 more approaching from the southwest again. They passed directly overhead without a sound. Through the binoculars they appeared to be round and flame like, traveling in a straight line from the southwest to the northeast until they were out of sight. The whole event lasted maybe 2-3 minutes."],"Latitude":"40.981202","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"48371","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
