I figured it was an airplane, so I went out to investigate. Sure enough, there was a large orange ball of light moving, at what I would call cruising speed. It was larger than what an airplane would be, and it was moving from Southwest to Northeast. It cast an orange glow over our deck as it passed over. It almost resembled a huge firework that wouldn't burn out. We kept waiting for it to burn out and it never did. It went directly over our house and it was COMPLETELY silent! It moved so far Northeast that we could no longer see it. I have NEVER in my 38 years seen something so strange. It was simply not explainiable, unless it was a metor burning out, but it wouldn't have lasted that long I wouldn't think. It didn't blink like a gaseous ball the way stars do. It was both exciting and scary at the same time. Hoping someone out there can track down some answers..."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri","Date of the Event":"07/03/2010 10:18 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-90.597991","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.784805,+-90.597991(24197)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24197) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 12:13 UTC","Summary":"Bright Orange Silent Ball of Light","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24197.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24197.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Case Number":"24197","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.784805","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","City":"St Peters"}
