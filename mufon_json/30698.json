It was a dark night clear no moon. I stepped onto my back deck closed the door and all of a sudden it got darker. I naturaly looked up and directly over my house coming from front to back where I was on the deck was a huge craft. It was not that high in the sky all black no sound whatsoever. It looked like a huge flying wing. I stood there as it flew at a very slow speed in a direct straight line to the east until it was out of sight. Being near NY and also near a small airport we have many planes flying over all the time. This was not high enough was enormus and made no sound and no lights. I just wanted to see if anyone else reported this at that time."],"Summary":"Huge black Craft no sound no lights flying straight and slow and very low to ground","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.278356","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Region":"Connecticut","Date Submitted":"08/07/2011 01:40 UTC","City":"Branford","Longitude":"-72.852092","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Branford","There were no other sightings in Branford on or around November 15th 1995"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08072011-0050","Date of the Event":"11/15/1995 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","Case Number":"30698","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
