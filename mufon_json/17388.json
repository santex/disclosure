We do know it was not a plane, and it had no trail. The event lasted approx. 2 minutes or so before it was out of sight. it was moving diagonally across the sky in a north western pattern (not normal because our weather always flows south east or north east) we never heard a sound from it, but it appeared to be pretty high. when we took a picture and then reviewed it, it looks like multiple lights, but from the gound it looked like just one. The quality of my picture may not be that great either. oh, well. I just wanted to share what we saw!! You will need to zoom in on the picture to get a good look at the lights"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"17388","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around June 7th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-06092009-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Independence","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/07/2009 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.945358,+-84.542969(17388)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17388) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/07/2009 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-84.542969","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Kentucky"}
