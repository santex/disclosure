Having recently seen a strange object over the lake nearby, I decided to stop and take a closer look. I also had my digital camera with me, so I took it out and began taking pictures of the object. The object did not leave a con trail, and I did not hear the usual sound that jets make as they pass over-head. The object moved in a straight line, as can be depicted by the pictures that I took, from the South-Western horizon towards the North-Eastern horizon, where it went behind a cloud. I did not feel any strange reactions to the object, or observe any abnormal reactions in the area around me throughout the duration of the event."],"Date of the Event":"06/08/2006 07:35 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07112006-0001","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bullfrog","There were no other sightings in Bullfrog on or around June 8th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-110.695848","Case Number":"5052"}
