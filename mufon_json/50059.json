I spotted a strange light, at first I thought it was a star but it began to flash which made me think it was a plane. Then the flashing kept changing randomly from very fast to very slow. The object was making sharp turns and looked like it was floating and wasn't moving very fast. I watched it for a few minutes then it moved east out over the north sea. I continued home and when I was looking out over the River Tay to the south towards Leuchars Air base where I saw another light which flashed it made a few turns then headed out East."],"Region":"","Country":"United Kingdom","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=56.484154,+-2.995567(50059)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50059) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Log Number":"GB-08222013-0007","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/19/2013 09:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-2.995567"}
