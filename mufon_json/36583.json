I thought it was strange because there was no sound but quickly dismissed it and closed my garage door. I then put the leash on my dog and went out back heading to the southern side of the house. There it was again only floating south instead of east on first sighting. I was looking at it when it skipped to the right real fast. I turned my head torward my dog and then back and it was gone. There was no sound at all and appeared to be fairly low to ground. I have no idea what it was, but the night was completely clear."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.807788,+-81.722872(36583)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36583) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03192012-0013","City":"Tavares","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"28.807788","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"36583","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"when getting morning paper and taking dog out in backyard I saw the same round light .
