It appeared to have crash landed about a mile east of my home. Within 2 minutes, a helicopter with blinking red lights and one solid blue light appeared and began circling an area of about one square mile east of my home and continued to hold this pattern for at least 30 minutes. I drove my car toward the area where the crash could have occurred, all the while watching the helicopter continue on it's path, but there were no signs of a crash, fire, or emergency services response. As I write this, it is 1:30 am and the helicopter is still circling in the same pattern, without a searchlight on I might add."],"Log Number":"US-04172009-0009","Summary":"Fiery green ball.","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"16548","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/17/2009 12:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16548.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16548.html"],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Region":"Arizona"}
