I feel silly contacting you about this, but my friend assures me you wont think Im crazy. So here goes. Last night, in the early morning hours, (unsure of time) I heard the loud sounds of a helicopter flying very low over my apartment complex. It was then joined by a second. I have been watching these come and go over the course of several months but last night it lasted for nearly an hour! (honestly could have been longer). What are your thoughts on this? We have seen them on a regular basis. Once, two military choppers were seen \"escorting\" a small craft (I think to be a small plane) directly over our townhouse. Myself, husband and 16 yo son all saw it. Now this. Its just an oddity I would love explained. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. You may also contact me by phone. My number is (812)272-9619. Thank you so very much for your time and help. Maybe Im just overly curious, but I have to know what this is about! many thanks!
