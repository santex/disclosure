Ive seen a lot of UFO before and I wasnt shocked or scared. At the end before it vanished it literally jumped like 2 miles to the south west and then within three or four seconds it jumped back to where I originally saw it in the first place and then it kinda dimed down and to me vanished."],"Summary":"it was a Bright Blue, Red, and white pulsating light","Longitude":"-72.340605","Latitude":"43.372114","Source":"MUFON"}
