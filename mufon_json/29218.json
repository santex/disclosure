Normally i have no reason to go outside but i was moving some equipment. As i rounded the corner of the building i looked up an noticed how bright the moon was and noted the one small cloud that was near it. I started to look away when three \"stars\" caught my eye. They seemed to appear below the cloud. I thought to my self that it was neat they formed a triangle..at that exact moment, they all started moving together. they seemed to be drifting...i watched as they all lowered slightly and silently,and drifted towards me and that's when i realized i was looking at one object with lights on it..it was not an airplane. It seemed to drift for a few seconds then pick up speed and flew off to my left (east i think). i was trying to keep my eyes on it and grab my iphone but gave up cause my iphone cant take pics in the dark. I think i stood there for a full min just stunned. I didnt mention it to anyone. I am waiting to see if i am the only one that saw it. this took place at exactly 3:42am"],"Log Number":"US-05232011-0006","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"29218"}
