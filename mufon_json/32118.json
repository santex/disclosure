{"Latitude":"42.264481","divs":["Sighting DetailsPulled up to an intersection facing east in my car, and it looked almost like orange-red lights were strung across the sky. The only way to describe the light is that it was similar to the burning embers remaining after detonating large firworks. Not terribly bright, almost glowing. There was no noise -- no rotors, no engines, nothing. Orbs were moving somewhat slowly in formation toward the west, stretched across the sky. Again, it was strange because there was no noise as they passed overhead. Sped home to show my son, but they were obscured by trees. Drove back to the original location, and while it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes, there were only two remaining in the sky. They were high in the air, but the lights did not look like airplane lights. Watched as the last two passed overhead to the west. I have tried to find out more about this fleet of orbs, but there was nothing reported in the local paper."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/25/2011 08:10 UTC","Summary":"Fleet of silent red-orange orbs, traveling west, single file, from horizon to overhead","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32118.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32118.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"09/26/2011 09:11 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"32118","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Mundelein","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.264481,+-87.97521(32118)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32118) map </A>","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Mundelein","There were no other sightings in Mundelein on or around September 25th 2011"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-87.97521","Log Number":"US-09262011-0024"}
