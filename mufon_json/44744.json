While reviewing photos on Sunday, 12-23-2012 I noticed an unusual object in the upper portion of one of the photos. The object is disc shaped and appears to have a circular lit area in the center of the bottom and what appear to be lights or windows on the upper portion of the disc. The object was not visible to my eye at the time the photo was taken and is not visible in the second photo taken roughly 15 seconds after the first. I have included the photo of the object in the attachment."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/22/2012 04:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-12232012-0016","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"Lakewood","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-105.143439","Latitude":"39.682216","Date Submitted":"12/23/2012 08:39 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44744.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44744_submitter_file1__sunset12222012.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44744.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
