(I HATE MY BROKEN ENGLISH...) I SAW A BUNCH OF STARS AND THEN I THOUGH ONE OF THOSE STARS STARTED TO MOVE AND COMING IN MY WAY, I STARTED TO RECORD AND WHEN I HAVE THAT THING OVER ME I HAVE TO CHOOSE IF I SHOULD KEEP IT RECORDING OR IF I SHOULD WATCH IT BY MY OWN EYES. I DID BOTH BUT WHAT I SAW WITH MY EYES WAS SOME KIND OF DISC WITH BLUE-WHITE-RED FLASHING SEQUENTIALLY LIGHTS IN THE SURFACE OF THAT \"DISC\" IN AN UNUSUAL ALTITUD, ACTUALLY I COULD SAY IT COULDN���T BE A SUPERSONIC AIR-CRAFT, I COULD EXPLAIN IT BETTER IN SPANISH. WELLL, THEN AFTER ALL I GOT REALLY NERVOUS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY OR THAT COULD SAW ME. I DON���T REALLY KNOW. FINALLY I CAME BACK TO MY COMPUTER AND CHECK THE VIDEO RECORDING. PLAYING THE VIDEO I SAW A LOT OF POSSIBLE TICKLING POINTS LOCATING THE OBJECT I���VE ALL READY RECORDED, THEN I FOUND IT, AND ZOOMING IN THE VIDEO SO I CAN WATCH THAT CRAFT CAREFULLY BUT BY A 5-7 FRAMES GOING FORTH IN THE SECUENCE, A IMPERCEPTIBLE FLASH MADE ME REALIZE THAT OVER THAT \"CRAFT\" WERE ANOTHER \"THING\" A CIGAR UFO. SO I HAVE VARIOUS ASPECTS IN THIS DESCRIPTION I COULD SPECIFY TO MAKE SENSE TO ANOTHERS."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/30/2011 11:43 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc","Latitude":"19.294167","Country":"Mexico","Date Submitted":"10/31/2011 04:53 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.294167,+-99.641031(33008)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33008) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Mexico","Summary":"HI TECH GOVERMENT SECRET AIR/SPACE CRAFT THEN UFO IN THE ANALYSIS OMG!","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s)","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33008.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33008.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Toluca de Lerdo","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering,Other","Log Number":"MX-10312011-0029","Longitude":"-99.641031"}
