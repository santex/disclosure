I was sitting there and out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright light; like someone shined a mirror in my eye. I looked up right away and saw five reflective gold balls floating next to each other each with a bright orange flashing light. I tried to take a picture but the stop light turned green and I had to go. I did a U-turn as fast as I could (about a mile down the highway) but I was unable to find them again."],"Date of the Event":"05/17/2011 01:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29133.html"]}
