{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching TV with my wife when I realized that it was time to start the sprinkler system, almost 7:30pm. It is my routine to do it between 7:30pm and 8:00pm everyday during the summer. Even thought the system has an automatic start and end time. I like to manually set it. As I exit the back door, which leads to the back yard, I looked up to the North East, nine o'clock, of the house and saw four objects flying in formation. It reminded me of military planes when flying. I would say about an inch apart when I close my left eye. They were approximately 20 feet above one my next door neighbor���s pine tree. The tree itself stands at approximately 50 feet above ground. I took a good look at them and they seem to be like balloons with candles inside of them. One candle, if you will, per balloon. The balloons were white and translucent. The candle flame stood approximately an inch from the middle bottom of the object. It had the usual bluish, yellow color. It moved very rapidly back and forth. Back meaning North East and forward South East. In the same direction the objects were moving. My first impression was that they were balloons with a candle in it. I thought only kids would think of placing a candle inside a balloon and or perhaps a very irresponsible adult. I began to feel agitated and became very concern due to the fact of a fire hazard. I called my wife and asked her to come to the back door to see the objects. The objects kept on flying at a very slow pace. When they reached the 12:00 o'clock mark right above me. I realized they were not balloons after all but something resembling a jelly-fish shape. The material was white and translucent but not transparent. It seems also organic and biological of some sort.This is the best I can describe it. By this time, my wife had made it were I was standing. She was amazed at the sighting. When the objects reached the 3:00 o'clock mark they began turning left at an approximate 5 to 10 degree angle. As the objects gained altitude and were almost out of sight. The shape changed resembling a red ball like light in the sky. They kept their formation until they gained an incredible amount of speed and went straight up in the air until they disappeared into the south eastern sky. A few other characteristics I also noticed are that they did not make any noise nor did any smoke came out of the balloon since it was completely sealed at the bottom. I stated in the previous paragraph when I first saw them I was astonished but concerned about the possibility of a fire hazard. Then, when they passed right above me I had a peaceful feeling. Something like time stood still. I thought these objects are beautiful. After they disappear in the sky I got this rush of anxiety to find out what these object were. I had never seen something like this before."],"Date of the Event":"08/16/2009 07:30 UTC","Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-120.553201","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"08/16/2009 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"18867","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-08252009-0007","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Balloons/Red Lights/Jellyfish","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.811503,+-120.553201(18867)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18867) map </A>","trends":[],"Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18867.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18867.html"],"Latitude":"43.811503"}
