The object was a circular fireball that had a lateral trajectory. It was not a meteor or shooting star--it was large and beneath the clouds. At first, I assumed it must be an airplane or helicopter's light. However, as I looked closer, it was clearly a flaming ball of some sort. I've seen fireworks of all kinds and have never seen anything like this. The object, again, had a steady trajectory across the sky and did not lose velocity or brightness. I lost sight of the object when it went behind the treeline behind my home."],"Longitude":"-78.429927","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.083639","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"This was a circular fireball that had a lateral trajectory.
