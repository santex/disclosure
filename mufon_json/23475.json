(looking toward the West.) The clouds covered the sky and a small hole started forming, it was a Small hole and perfectly circle, to perfect. At the same time a bright light appeared to come out of the clouds toward us, (standing there stareing... wondering what were seeing...) I thought it might be the sun just beaming through it looked like it came out of the clouds with a bright trail behind it, (at that point we are kinda freaking out)it looked like it went right back the other way and dissappered! (thats what made this so weird!) The hole that seemed like it was growing... It just dissappered and the clouds took back over that spot in the sky! We looked at eachother in Aww, both of our hair standing on its end!"],"Tags":"City"}
