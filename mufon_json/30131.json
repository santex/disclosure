I took a picture with my iPhone that didn't come out and by the time I grabbed my good camera, it was gone. I was with a friend and her and I thought it was the moon, but since we had just seen it above it, we realized it had to be something else. There was no noise at all, completely quiet outside. The objects just remained stationary in the sky until they were covered by the clouds from the storm moving in, I am not sure what it was, it was very interesting, and I would love to know what it was. I have no explanation as to what it could have been, I will try and enhance the photo and get back to you all."],"Date of the Event":"07/11/2011 10:48 UTC"}
