My Digital Camera picked up the following attached image. The next day I sent this photo to the local TV Station, KGW they never acknowledged this, neither did several other email contacts. Now I live in Idaho Falls, and the other night I was watching UFO's on the A&E channel where I was reminded of this photo I took. \"Please relate if anyone has seen a similar object.
