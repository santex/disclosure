{"Date Submitted":"07/18/2012 09:46 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking out the trash after 9pm and just happened to look up and saw a large yellow-orange starbursts. Stopped and watched it for about 20 seconds. During this time it would slowly disintegrate then reappear a little to the left of where it just was. It did this about three times and looked as if it was on a path. After it disintegrated for a third time it did not reappear. There were airplanes in the sky but looked very far away and living next to an airport we see planes quite a bit, but none were close at the time. The starbursts were to the east which would put it over the Atlantic Ocean. Almost looked like explosions but there was no sound even after waiting about ten minutes to see if they would show up again. Not sure what it was but was quite surprising and interesting to see."],"Region":"South Carolina","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/18/2012 09:12 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40909.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40909.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Latitude":"33.839181","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.156444","Summary":"Yellow-Orange starburst disapearing and reapearing each time in different spot","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.839181,+-81.156444(40909)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40909) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07182012-0017","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Case Number":"40909","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
