It was still light out, but later in the day. The sky was quite cloudy. I was in the passenger seat and was talking to my friend while he was driving. I just so happened to look up in the sky and noticed something coming down through the clouds. At first I didn't think much about it and just kept talking while still fixated on the object. The object kept lowering itself becoming more and more visible. I couldn't place in my mind what the object was exactly...so, I asked my friend what he thought it was. He leaned over the steering wheel to look up to see it. Both of us had no idea what it was. By the time we both looked up at it and tried to gauge it's size, it moved straight back up into the sky and because of the clouds we didn't see anything else. We both agreed that it was about the size of a football field. We rushed home to tell my parents, but they thought we were ridiculous and we never talked about it again."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.768843,+-95.36672(23521)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23521) map </A>","Latitude":"29.768843","Date of the Event":"05/15/1994 07:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Very large UFO seen at short range distance","Case Number":"23521","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-05302010-0002","Object Shape":"Oval","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
