Dak. when I observed a white star like object that I first noticed in the western sky at approx. the second star down from the top of the big dipper handle, moved to the No. East, made a short abrupt turn and went in a northerly direction all in approx. 10 seconds until I lost sight of it. There was no flashing lights or anything else just a light. I am positive it was not a meteorite, satellite or airplane as it moved far too fast and turned to sharp for either one. It was a clear night and there were no airplanes anywhere near."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07182013-0006","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Rapid City","There were no other sightings in Rapid City on or around July 17th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
