We thought it was a plane at first but as it got closer we noticed no collision lights. We grabbed my monocular night vision and look at it and you could see clearly it was a round lit up white object. Nothing protruded from object did not make any noise nor leave any trail, it was moving at a good pace. Object was in our atmosphere maybe 500-1000 feet up in the sky. Lasted about 5 minutes I guess, there were other people working out in the Rail Yard, if they looked up they would have seen it, object could of resembled an approaching aircraft if they just glanced up at it, as there is an airport nearby and airliners do fly over Gavin Yard."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.240113,+-101.174162(47489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47489) map </A>","Object Features":"None"}
