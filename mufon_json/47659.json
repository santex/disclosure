I was standing in the backyard and looked up into the night sky as I always do. While looking towards the southwest I saw this star-like object appear instantaneously in the area of the sky I was looking. One moment nothing was there of note (the usual sprinkling of stars) and then this bright white star-like object suddenly appears. It did not pulsate or move. Its luminosity was greater than the planet Venus. To give an idea of its distance, it appeared to be smaller than the size of a dime in the night sky and was about 50Ëš above the southwestern horizon. This \"light\" remained on for 2 seconds and then seemingly \"turned off\". A good analogy to this experience would be if you were in a dark room and someone at the other side of the room turned on a flashlight, kept it on for 2 seconds and then turned it off. That's what this looked like. I initially thought this was a weather balloon catching the sun's rays at high altitude but I just don't know."],"Date Submitted":"05/26/2013 11:22 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47659.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47659.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Overland Park","There were no other sightings in Overland Park on or around May 25th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright light suddenly appears in night sky for 2 seconds","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.990128,+-94.661662(47659)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47659) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","City":"Overland Park","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05262013-0024","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-94.661662"}
