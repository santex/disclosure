I am more than willing to let someone take the u.f.o. section off my video tape. My oldest son at the time also watched it with me, he was 6 at the time.The objects stayed still for a long time than moved slowly but two stayed the same distance apart and the third took off and came back in the distance.I have always been afraid to tell anyone until I saw a u.f.o. program on t.v. 1-19 08 on our cable t.v. station.People said i was nuts when i told them even when i showed the video. So i kept is quiet all this time but have been dyind to share it with someone who would show concern.I dont know how to put the video clip on the net. Please feel free to contact me."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Chico","There were no other sightings in Chico on or around March 17th 1996"],"City":"Chico","Log Number":"US-01212008-0013","Case Number":"9115","Tags":"City"}
