{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving south on US 101 and looked over towards the SFO airport area and a shiny reflective object caught my eye. After several takes, it was a donut shaped metallic object that was tilting left and then right while rotating. As I was moving I couldn't tell if it was moving too but it seemed to be hovering. It was high up in the sky but not too high as I was able to see it's shape (donut) and movement very clearly. I couldn't watch it for long as I was on a highway but it was definitely there. Possibly it was a kite or something man made but since it was right next to SFO I'm assuming that wouldn't be allowed due to clearance issues. I contacted SFO airport with inquiries but I didn't receive any response."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.604917,+-122.381494(19697)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19697) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/26/2009 06:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-122.381494","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Donut shaped metallic ufo over SFO Airport","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"37.604917","Date Submitted":"09/28/2009 04:38 UTC","Case Number":"19697","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19697.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19697.html"],"City":"Millbrae","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Millbrae","There were no other sightings in Millbrae on or around September 26th 2009"],"Region":"California","Log Number":"US-09282009-0010","Tags":"City"}
