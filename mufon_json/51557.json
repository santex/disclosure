We saw the object which at first appeared to be a meteor...but did not disappear. Instead of disintegrating into nothing, like a meteor would do, it split off into 4 lights and they would flicker on & off and they all started making formations. None of the lights seemed to be effected by gravity. They would move around a bit higher and a bit lower. sometimes in a line and sometimes not. we were still driving down a very populated highway when they eventually vanished. They whole event may have lasted about 2-3 minutes."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Large white light split into 4--hovering in different formations. lights on & off","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Ohio"}
