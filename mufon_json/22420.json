It blinked 3 times then started moving. Then another one came into view (another craft) in the same position the first was one originally. Then I turned around and the first craft seemed to circle the park I was at. Then I looked where the 2nd craft was and it dimmed like the other one, blinked and flew directly over the park. They flew around for 5-10 more minutes then disappeared."]}
