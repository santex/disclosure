But I wanted to attach two new photos. The first one is a closer crop of the white, glowing object previously posted. The second shot was taken in the same place as the first, but shows...an energy field, morphing? The glowing white object did seem to change shape when I looked at it through my binoculars. I took 20 photos of the white glowing object from two different angles, but the jpeg numbered P1030155000 shows a very unusual form. In looking back at my photos, I see the photo right before P103155000 and after, show the white glowing object. So it's a mystery as to what the unusual form is. I have a high-quality digital camera, I'm a nature photographer, and there were no clouds in the sky."],"Latitude":"36.785701","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.785701,+-119.415292(22371)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22371) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/19/2010 12:07 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.415292","Case Number":"22371","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere"}
