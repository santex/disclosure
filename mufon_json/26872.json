I probably wouldn't have noticed it normally, but it was the only light in the sky since it was completely overcast and still dark outside. I couldn't tell how high up it was, but it wasn't low at all. It had to be at least a half mile up or higher. I had a hard time at first thinking it was not a star, but the cloud coverage was thick, and it was far brighter than a star would be even when there would be no cloud cover. I stayed outside for approximately 10-15 minutes until I went into work because I was going to be late. During the whole 15 minutes the light never moved, changed shade or colors at all."],"Latitude":"43.309556","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.309556,+-91.779549(26872)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26872) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Decorah","There were no other sightings in Decorah on or around December 5th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26872.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26872.html"],"Longitude":"-91.779549"}
