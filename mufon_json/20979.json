We observed them for maybe 15 minutes. We decided to leave. \"Scared\" Helicopters don't fly that high and fixed wing planes couldn't do those moves. What did we see in 1965? The Comanche Peak Power Plant was in the developmental stages at that time which was near by. They were clearly UFO's! This sighting also sounds like some that are being reported today!
