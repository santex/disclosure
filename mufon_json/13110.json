I would've attributed it to a comet or something, but it seemed too close to the Earth. It mosed faster than a plane. I immediately got excited and called my fiance to let her know. She then told me she had seen a program on the discovery program about people seeing these things and I got excited and decided to inform MUFON. It isn't the first time I've seen this phenomenon. This is the fifth. First time writing about it. Over a span of about 8 months I've seen multicolored flares standing still then disapearing, or streaking. I've seen blue, green and orange."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/19/2008 09:15 UTC","City":"Leesburg","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-83.566314","Summary":"A green diamond shaped light streaked across the sky, flared and disapeared.","Latitude":"39.36483","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Leesburg","There were no other sightings in Leesburg on or around October 19th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/19/2008 09:15 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-10192008-0010","Object Shape":"Cross, Diamond, Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"13110","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13110_submitter_file1__PHall13110Map.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13110_submitter_file2__PHall13110Meteorreport.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13110.html"]}
