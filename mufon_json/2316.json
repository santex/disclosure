I was watchingfor about 5 minutes when 3 of the stars started to move across the sky in atriangle formation,at the same speed and distance from each other. They allstopped and a fourth star came over to join the lead star and they got brighterand pulsed. The other 2 stars moved in and out from each other but neverconnected.
