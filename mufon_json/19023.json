{"Weather Factors":"None","divs":["sighting detailsi know that this is a widely covered event and you probably have more than enough accounts for your investigation, but i wanted to add mine in the hope that maybe you had found an answer to what it was in the sky that night. even though it took place over 13 years ago it stills resonates in my head as if it happened yesterday. i have searched for a solid answer to no avail. any way here is my story. myself and two friends were driving down lincoln blvd. heading west at about 20th street. at that point i caught a large group of lights out of the right corner of my eye. i said to the other two people in my car \"do you guys see that?\" at which they responded \"yes!\" i slowed the car down and made a right onto 18th street which is a dead end road. there were several other cars pulled on to the street with the people outside of their vehicles and looking up. myself and my two passengers jump out of my truck and looked up as well. the object that i saw was huge. bigger than anything i had ever seen in the sky before or since. it was a boomerang\\ diamond shape with lights at each point. the lights were bright like baseball field lights. everybody stood there silent just staring with the occasional \"what is that?\" being muttered. the strangest part was that it made absolutly no noise. i am not a rocket scientist but anything the length of two or more football fiels propell itself through the air should at the very least make some sort of sound. but there was nothing. after about 30-35 seconds there was great big \"woosh\" sound and the lights immediatly went out. the after glow from the lights lasted for about 5 seconds, like after a camera flash blinds you. then all you could see was the sillouette of the object. still heading in the same direction towards the north edge of squaw peak to a place called dreamy draw. dreamy draw is now the place that state route 51 runs to the north part of the valley. it never picked up speed which i approximate at 40-50 mph. it finally disappeared behind the north slope of squaw peak. everybody at that point got in their cars and simply drove away. my friends and i talk about it all night with each other. it wasn't until later on, maybe a month later were even heard abot the phoenix lights. the pictures that they printed in the paper and the video the news broadcasted were not the lights that i saw that night. not even close. there was a woman in town, a doctor, that made a documentry of the phoenix lights event. i went to go see it but she made it into some spiritual encounter that we all took part in. for me it was something unexplainable. and it has racked every bit of logic that i have in my body. anyway if you have any answers i would greatly appreciate them. and vice versa if you have any more questions for me please ask. thank you for your time, preston brown"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.451817,+-112.072757(19023)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19023) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"19023","Region":"Arizona","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 26th 1997"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-112.072757","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19023.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19023.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Diamond","Summary":"The Phoenix Lights event but not the flares seen in the the south western part of the city.","Log Number":"US-09012009-0027","Latitude":"33.451817","City":"Phoenix","Date of the Event":"03/26/1997 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/01/2009 06:57 UTC"}
