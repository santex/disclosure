Then it was like out of nowhere this odd shaped thing (which at first I thought it was some sort of falling material) I just watched as it flew over my house with no sound no light and no emission. This has not been the first time I've seen a ufo by my house but but this was very odd and was so much different then the others. Its hard to explain."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47053.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47053.html"],"Longitude":"-74.27872","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"47053","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Woodbridge Township","There were no other sightings in Woodbridge Township on or around April 28th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
