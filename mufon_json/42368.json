They appear to move like bugs on the water in various directions. They do seem to have a limited range though and dont stray from it. They also look like stars but do not twinkle, and almost appear to have an aura around them. This happens every night when it gets dark and lasts all night. On Tuesday nights I have noticed that one of them, appears to move over my neighbors home to the East. I have seen planes and satellites, and thats not what these are."],"Date of the Event":"07/18/2012 10:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Charter Township of Clinton","There were no other sightings in Charter Township of Clinton on or around July 18th 2012"]}
