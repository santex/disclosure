{"Sighting Duration":"00:03:08","Longitude":"24.266523","Country":"Latvia","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsWell at first I was actually filming the upcoming thunderstorm but then I saw something rather strange, something that shouldn't be there at the moment. Those objects were too big and bright to be just ordinary birds and they were flying too close to each other to be identified as planes so obviously the first thing I thought of was extraterrestrial spaceships and the of course came the cursing and excitement and jumping up and down so the video became a bit sketchy for a while. And strangely, I don't remember how those objects disappeared. There's nothing else much to tell rather than see so, enjoy."],"Summary":"Two starlike objects(max 500m distance between both) flies in almost straight line few minutes before the rain starts to pour.","Case Number":"38526","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=56.868237,+24.266523(38526)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38526) map </A>","Latitude":"56.868237","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Riga","Date of the Event":"08/16/2009 03:28 UTC","City":"Riga","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/26/2012 07:03 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Riga","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"LV-05262012-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38526.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38526.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
