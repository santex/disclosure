After a short period of time, 15 min. or so clouds dissipated but clouds near moon spread out and formed perfect circle around the moon. The moon was in the center of what could be described as giant clock face and the outer ring was 15 to 20 moon lengths out from the center moon. I estimate the cloud ring to be near 2 or 3 moon lengths wide. Not a UFO as such but plenty strange nonetheless."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.449105,+-79.989936(27978)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27978) map </A>","Summary":"Observed Perfect Circle around near full moon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27978.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27978.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
