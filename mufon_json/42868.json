I was admiring Venus which was due east. I noticed a light a little to the south and when I turned to look I realized there were two lights, one right behind the other one. They were identical and a little less brighter than Venus. I thought they were planes at first, but saw only steady bright white lights. There were no flashing red lights and no sound. They looped around as they had been coming from the east and then they headed north at a leisurely pace. After about ten seconds they both disappeared. The lights just switched off at the same time. It was still quite dark, I couldn't see any crafts the lights could have belonged to. They emitted no noise at all. I stood out there for another ten minutes, but they didn't reappear. When I realized I had finally seen a UFO, I smiled happpily and thanked them for saying hello as it were."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42868.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42868.html"],"Longitude":"-104.839048","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"A light in the sky looped towards me.
