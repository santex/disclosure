Both times my wife was sleeping next to me and remained asleep until i was frightened and woke her up and told her about that. i have also been woken up by a needle prick in my arm or shoulder area. i have not attached that to the other events but, we wake up almost every night around the same time frame usually between 2 am and 4 am, with a sense of dread or that something is amiss in our room. I have no idea, how to explain what i have seen or what my wife has witnessed. just would like some input, on the matter and if anyone has had this happen to them"],"Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"10/12/2012 03:16 UTC","Region":"North Carolina","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.762883"}
