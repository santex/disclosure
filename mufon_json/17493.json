{"divs":["sighting detailsi just watched the discovery channel���s show detailing the ufo events near kokomo, in on 4\\16\\2008. i���m trying to reach glen means to augment his investigation. on that night i was sitting in my upstairs west-facing den. i heard and felt the boom hit the house. it was much more substantial than any sonic boom i���ve ever experienced. growing up less than 30 miles from a usaf base (grissom), i made it a hobby to learn about military aircraft and i was very much accustomed to sonic booms over the years. this was vastly different than anything i had ever experienced in my 36 years (a feeling apparently shared by hundreds who dialed 911 ��� i being one of them). the best way i can describe the force was to compare it to a giant mattress striking the west-facing side of my house. it was forceful, yet didn���t break windows. there was significant force striking not only the windows, but the west-facing wall as well. it was definitely a shockwave of some sort ��� that i am certain. it took probably less than 10 seconds for me to run downstairs and check on my family ��� then i immediately looked out my west-facing sliding glass windows. what i saw took my breath away. it was a series of white-orange colored lights in sets of five. similar to what hank bolger described in the documentary and similar to what j.t. puterbaugh caught on film; however, they were distinctly different in that they were arranged in a sloped line of five lights alternating in direction and notably, while mr. puterbaugh���s film showed the lights lasting very briefly, with the first extinguishing before the last, the lights i saw were not flickering and appeared and disappeared at about the same time as all the other lights in the grouping of five. very quickly after the first set, sloped in about -20 degrees from left to right, i saw a mirror image of that in another set of 5 lights sloping the opposite direction in almost the exact same area as the first set. this alternating 5 light sloping repeated for about a total of 4 times before ending completely. firstly, i agree with the investigators that these were likely flairs from military aircraft; however, it must be noted it had to be several criss-crossing aircraft to achieve this appearance. i say this mainly because the intervals at which these appeared going directly opposite one-another meant that an aircraft would have to be pulling g-forces beyond human endurance and the flairs would have radiated outward due to the centrifugal forces involved in maneuvering in an s-pattern. i certainly accept these were flairs, but what i saw was notably different than caught on the puterbaugh film, and i maintain was caused by several military aircraft criss-crossing each other. i���m unaware of such a defensive maneuver in modern military aviation, but would be interested to know if this is common. secondly, as i scanned the night sky i noticed a peculiar ���smoky��� streak coming from the eastern sky going in a straight line westerly terminating just above kokomo. it was much thicker in width than a typical aircraft trail and it was suspended in the air. since the night was very clear i could make out the distinct shape against the night sky. it also very much appeared that the trail originated very high in altitude and ended just above kokomo at a much lower altitude. lastly, almost directly above kokomo and slightly north, i saw a whitish-blue flashing light of very high-altitude that appeared not be moving at all. i counted 15 seconds while it flashed on and off about 5 times and then simply disappeared. i scanned the skies that night and saw several commercial passenger aircraft and this light wasn���t in any way similar. for one, it was a single light source as opposed to the typical red\\green\\white on commercial craft. two, it appeared to be at the limits of our atmosphere ��� if such a thing can be determined. i've witnessed satellites in our orbit before and you can always see them moving against the night stars. this object did not appear to move. oddly, of all the events that night, this particular light struck me as the most strange. i should also note there were no sounds accompanying the light show after the initial shockwave. my best guess is it was a meteor exploding just above kokomo, but it doesn���t explain the military aircraft being in the exact area within 10 seconds of the event. nor does it explain why military exercises are occurring over a small city at low altitudes (defensive exercises and evasive maneuvers no less). i did not see the strobe lights that dustin cronkhite witnessed, but i did see enough to convince me the ���strings��� of lights were military maneuvers. what i can���t explain (and have yet to hear from other people) is the smoky trail in the night sky and the white\\blue pulsating light high in the northern sky. thank you for your time. regards, rob"],"Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.493437","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There were 6 other sightings in Kokomo on or around April 16th 2008"],"Case Number":"17493","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17493.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17493.html"],"Longitude":"-86.130783","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/16/2008 12:00 UTC","City":"Kokomo","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Regarding the well-publicized events near Kokomo on 4/16/2008.","Log Number":"US-06152009-0002","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.493437,+-86.130783(17493)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17493) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"Indiana"}
