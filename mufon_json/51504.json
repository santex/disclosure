As I'm dreaming I wake up to my heart thumping as if I had went for a run or jog then all of suddenly I wake up to a bright white light appearing right outside of my window. I get up to look out my window to see what appear like a small white plane hovering over my backyard. Then it began hovering away but would appear flying as if it was a small civilian plane. This ended shortly after I had woke up at 3:58 a.m. . Shortly after I had noticed it had hovered towards a old gulf course right behind the backyard and when it did I could also notice a humming sound then the sound changed to a small civilian plane. I felt scared, threatened, and confused to why this could be happening not only have I felt emotional afterwards but I could also feel static electricity I believed I had picked up from the flying object."],"Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"10/13/2013 03:43 UTC"}
