It was between 1500 and1700 hours. I started feeling changes mentally and physically, and somethingmade me look up. The saucer appered to have been observing me. At this time Ibegan to feel a sence of telepathy, so I decided out of curiosity to send amental message to it. Nothing complex, just a simple hello. As I sent mymessage, I felt like there were voices in my head. Without warning the UFOcloaked. It was like someone passed something in front of it, because it fadedaway from left to right. Ive had a long history of beleving Ive been aducted,because of things like scoop marks and strange markings. If I am beingabducted, this is the third time Ive seen them."],"Region":"Utah"}
