I was taking photos and looked up at a beautiful blue sky with zero clouds. To the southwest a bright white object was visible at extreme altitude. The object had no winds or marks that could be identified as any conventional craft. I snapped two photos a couple of minutes apart. The object was very high and appeared to be moving faster than an airliner that usually has visible wings, windows, and markings. This had none. Once it was out of sight about two minutes after the second photograph, two ARMED blue F18s flew right over our heads, low, less than 1000 feet above the ground in the general direction the object was last seen."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.272153,+-97.738021(26421)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26421) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11082010-0001","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"30.272153","Date of the Event":"11/06/2010 06:15 UTC","City":"Austin","Date Submitted":"11/08/2010 12:19 UTC","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were no other sightings in Austin on or around November 6th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Comet like bright white light","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
