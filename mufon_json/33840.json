My wife and I observed something flying slowly back and forth for nearly an hour. I looked at it through my binoculars and at times it appeared to look like a one of the original shuttle mockups prior to us ever actually flying one. I'm pretty sure it was some sort of experimental aircraft but I want to know how I can find out what was flying today? It was very high up and did not have any contrails even though passenger jets flying over did. It would fade out at times and then fade back in. I suspect that's because of the way the sun was reflecting off of it."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Las Vegas","Log Number":"US-12052011-0013","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"12/05/2011 03:45 UTC","Case Number":"33840","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around December 5th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
