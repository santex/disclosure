{"trends":[],"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were in Derby, CT and we were driving home from the University of New Haven. The sky was split and we took a picture of the dark side and the light side. We did not notice it after we took the picture but we look closer and then we saw it looked liked at UFO. It was big and dull and it hovered and moves with the clouds. We had no reactions during the sighting because we didn't know or see it. After the sighting we were excited and were eager to find out if is was a real UFO. We drove away."],"Date Submitted":"07/25/2013 07:34 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.604221,+-73.086589(49185)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49185) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49185.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49185.html"],"Case Number":"49185","Tags":"City","Region":"Connecticut","Log Number":"US-07252013-0017","Longitude":"-73.086589","Object Shape":"Blimp, Disc","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"41.604221","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/23/2013 04:30 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Looks like it was cloaking itself within the clouds."}
