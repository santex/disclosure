{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking the dog for a walk down my driveway approximately 10:30 P.M. when I heard what I thought was a jet engine overhead. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a large plane of some kind with 5 or 6 red lights that would flash in unison. I couldn't see the outline of the plane, just the lights. The lights were in the shape of a check mark. At first I thought it was a B-2 bomber and then I thought it was too big for a B-2. Then I thought maybe a squadron of planes but the lights blinked in unison? It went from north to south in a straight line at a fairly slow speed. It probably took 3 or 4 minutes to travel out of sight. Afterwards I thought maybe a lighter than air ship, blimp of some kind. I got the feeling that it was one of ours. Didn't feel like I had seen something extraterrestrial."],"City":"Acton","Date Submitted":"03/28/2008 10:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Acton","There were no other sightings in Acton on or around March 28th 2008"],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"10118","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Boomerang","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.469994,+-118.196742(10118)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10118) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10118.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10118.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10118.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-03312008-0003","Latitude":"34.469994","Summary":"5 or 6 red lights and loud hum of engines","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/28/2008 10:45 UTC","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-118.196742"}
