I was laying on the couch, watching TV. 2. My TV is in front of a big bay window, it was impossible to miss. 3. A fireball..then I thought a star way falling perhaps.. 4. It looked like a big orange flash that was shooting downward until it disappeared. 5. I was surprised. It was not something I usually see out my window. I immediately texted myself so I would remember the event the next day; but mostly to get a time stamp. 11:39pm 6. It disappeared from view. I stood up and moved to the window, but there was nothing left to see."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.798503,+-83.620406(43540)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43540) map </A>","Summary":"Saw a orange flash from the sky...plummet straight down...thru the bay window while I was watching TV.","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash","Date of the Event":"10/24/2012 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Holly","Latitude":"42.798503","Case Number":"43540","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
