I watched if for a very long time, as it was stationary, silent, and had now wings, rotors, tail fins, or any thing else modern aircraft use for stability. I ran into my house to get binoculars after watching for this long, when i returned, it was gone. Even with my time in the military, i have not seen any thing like this in my life. Since i was still in school at this point in my life, i asked my friend if he seen something strange in the sky, he told me that he had. We wrote down what the object looked like on separate pieces of paper. Our descriptions were early describing the same thing."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.499242,+-77.741382(16741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16741) map </A>","Summary":"Hovering silver hotdog.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-04302009-0003","Case Number":"16741","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16741.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/20/2002 04:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in McVeytown","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-77.741382","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.499242","Sighting Duration":"00:40:00","Weather Factors":"None","City":"McVeytown"}
