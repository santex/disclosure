The sky was overcast so it was against greyish white clouds. The object was moving East to West very slowly. After about a minute or so the light faded to nothing and I could clearly see the object against the clouds. I can only describe it as cylindrical and vertical like a probe or something. I watched it for a few minutes then it faded into the clouds. This was very exciting for I have never observed a craft before."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39797.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39797.html"],"Latitude":"41.843361","Date of the Event":"06/24/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/25/2012 10:37 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Dixon","There were no other sightings in Dixon on or around June 24th 2012"],"Tags":"City"}
