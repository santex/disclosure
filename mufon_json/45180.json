I saw a star like object moving unusually fast across the northern sky. Way to fast to be a plane. It was too bright to be a satellite. It was in the north sky, moving from west to east. It took a sharp turn, and then began to head north. I first thought the object was a plane, but it was moving way too fast. I couldn't believe how fast it was moving. Then, I saw it take a very rapid turn and went north. I lost sight of the object as it was behind the tree line and buildings."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Mount Pleasant","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"43.607408","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-01132013-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45180.html"]}
