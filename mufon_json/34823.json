{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving in my truck heading east on Interstate 8 just coming off Interstate 10 by Casa Grande and I noticed just above me to my right what I thought was a plane flying low. When I got closer I noticed that it was not moving or it was moving very slow. As I kept driving I ended up almost right underneath the object. I didn't really have a chance to stop and get a good look or listen for any sound it was making, but it had three lights that made a triangle shape on the bottom. I lost sight of the object as I kept driving so I don't know how long it stayed there."],"Summary":"I was driving on I -8 and looked up at what i thought was a plane going to land, but when i got closer i noticed the lights were not flashing and the object was actually not moving.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.634855,+-112.138675(34823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34823) map </A>","Region":"Arizona","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34823.html"],"Longitude":"-112.138675","Country":"United States","City":"Casa Grande","Date Submitted":"01/13/2012 12:59 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/11/2012 09:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Casa Grande","There were no other sightings in Casa Grande on or around January 11th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"34823","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-01132012-0001","Latitude":"33.634855"}
