The size of the light itself was the same as the size of the moon, but it wasn't the moon because the moon was behind me. The light stayed the same size for a few seconds and then very slowly faded away. I did see an ariliner in the vacinity but ruled the airliner out because airliners can't glow that brilliantly and that the light had no flashing red lights. I also ruled out a helicopter for the same reasons. I am pretty sure it wasn't a meteor because of the fact that the light was stationary."]}
