I noticed a bright blue object flying freely in the air. Instantly caught my attention and I was stuck starring at it, I had never seen anything move soo fasy and smoothly in the sky. It had about 4-6 blue lights in a straight pattern. I could not make the entire shape if it because it was dark out but I did notice they were in a single form. It began to go in different directions, from up and down, side to side and even in different angles. Only blue lights no other. I ran inside to call my husband and when he came out, the object had moved further north until it disappeared.
