I went into the house to use the bathroom and my husband called me out. He said \"Look at that\". I witnessed 3 yellow orange orbs in the sky above the tree line. They appeared to be very playful as two of them kept circling each other. They moved across the sky at a good pace but slow enough for us to enjoy them. We watched them until they moved out of sight behind woods and hills. They were silent the whole time they were hear. My husband mentioned to me that he saw another group of three like them before I got out there with him. They appeared to be the same as the ones I witnessed with him. These looked like nothing I have ever seen before. I just felt curiosity when I saw them and hoped other people was able to witness them also. This is the first time my husband has ever seen something that he could not explain either. These were most definately not a plane or ordinary thing. No question."],"Longitude":"-84.820785","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.260888,+-84.820785(26592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26592) map </A>"}
