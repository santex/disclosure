The objects centered themselves over the western horizon at 30 degrees from the horizon then came to a stop for over a minute.Suddenly all four objects shot out in four different directions.All of them streaked across the sky so quickly we had trouble following them with our eyes & heads.The one on the left of the diamond had moved W & S just above the house line on the horizon,the one on the right had moved to roughly the same position but on the N & W.The top & bottom of the diamond flew in a line(one after the other)& ended up clear across the sky on the E horizon.They stopped @ about 60 degrees off the eastern horizon & then seperated.The top one flew S @ the same degree line.The remaining one flew to the N.We all watched them for a few minutes.They remained motionless.We each turned in a different direction & kept asking one another about the objects(out of our sight)in order to keep them all in sight collectively. Six or seven minutes later all four objects sped in to their original formation(as a diamond).Once again they traversed the sky @ speeds we could barely follow & met up slightly N at about 80 degrees from the northern horizon.When they met up,the intensity of the red light grew for about 30 seconds.Then they rose in the same pattern with their light getting weaker & weaker until we could no longer see them. The next day my father & sister called HAFB & the Miam-Dade Police Department(MDPD,@ that time it was transitioning a name change from Metropolitan Dade Sherrif's Office to Metro-Dade Police Department)to see if any calls had come in to report the incident.She was answered by HAFB that the air force was aware of those reports and abruptly hung up on.The MDPD also seemed disinterested in obtaining any details on the incident."],"Date of the Event":"12/20/1978 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-81.510184","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"8952","Summary":"Four objects made impossible maneuvers","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"27.671117","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01162008-0038","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8952.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8952.html"]}
