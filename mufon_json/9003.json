{"divs":["Sighting Details It was a clear day, cloudless and windless when I noticed an objet very high in the sky that stayed still. Thinking it was a bird perhaps I realized it was too high for a seagull as it appeared white. It then caught the sun and became silver. I thought it could be a metalic plane of some kind but it still remained motionless. When I realized it wasn't a plane, it shot across the blue sky, no vapor trail and no sound, over Cayuga Lake and dissappeared into the blue. I was walking during this time on our road with no traffic.I always look up to spot any birds I may recognize.I did not have a camera so no pics were taken."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"11/13/2007 01:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.484239,+-76.47994(9003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9003) map </A>","Region":"New York","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9003.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9003.html"],"Log Number":"US-01182008-0011","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Summary":"very high, stood still ,turned and caught the sun to look silver colored, then shot north and disappeared.
