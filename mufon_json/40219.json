I could see this object with my night goggles. I think this observation was not longer than 10-15 seconds I think, because it moved so fast. While moving, it also seemed to have a lightly instable flight path. It was a little bit oval and wasn't to see with barely eyes. One night after this occasion I saw it again! It was the same object, but now it moved the opposite flight path - from north to south."]}
