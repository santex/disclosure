It dropped strait down into a forested area. The object seemed to be a fewmiles away. My father and I agreed it looked like a meteor or shooting star,but it did not cross the sky- it shot strait down. We also agreed we have neverseen anything like that before. It was a semi-foggy evening and the light seemedto halo and surround the object. The green light extinquished, right after Iobsverved it. It certainly gave us something to talk about on the way home."],"Log Number":"","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright meteor like light shoots strait towards the"}
