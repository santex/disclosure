The location was Northridge, CA. The night sky was pretty clear, the wind pretty calm, temperature was mild 60���������s. I was in the backyard star watching which is pretty typical for my weekend evenings. Our backyard is on a south facing hill overlooking the San Fernando Valley, is quite dark for the Valley, and there are no homes behind us. From almost directly overhead a dark object caught my eye. As I focused it was a third round, or a rounded ���������boomerang��������� shape, of about seven or nine dark circles, I did not think to count them. It was pretty close overhead and moving slowly although it seemed to move past rather quickly. Its motion was very ���������smooth��������� and it was absolutely quiet. It moved from Northwest to Southeast with the center circle in front and the others tailing out left and right. It appeared and ���������disappeared��������� quickly. Not that it moved so far into the distance that I could no longer see it but that it just got so dark it sort of ���������disappeared��������� into the night sky. The entire time I actually saw it was maybe 10 ��������� 15 seconds. My first thought was ���������what the hell is that?��������� But logically I assumed it must have been a string of large black balloons let loose on Halloween night, although there remained some small hint of my initial thought ���������what was that���������. Then last night, 7 Nov, I Googled ���������why move to Florida��������� (nothing related to that night), and eight or nine results down I saw ���������A Florida parent and 18-year-old son report watching a large, fast-moving, boomerang-shaped object with no lights move directly overhead on November 3���������. I clicked on and read the article. I do not know what I saw that night, but the witness statements and description of what they saw could have been describing what I saw. Attached is a representation I made of what I saw that night. The entire object appeared to be just the circles which were a dark ���������grey���������, or at least appeared to have no color or illumination that I could distinguish. Again it moved slowly and smoothly, had no lights, and made not a sound."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Other","City":"Los Angeles","Longitude":"-118.513638","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.237983,+-118.513638(26443)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26443) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/08/2010 06:29 UTC","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around October 31st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26443.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26443.html"],"Case Number":"26443","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.237983","Date of the Event":"10/31/2010 07:30 UTC"}
