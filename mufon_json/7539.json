{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting Detailsdriving west in troy with one other friend in vehicle. Perfectly clear sky as the sun was setting. To the north west direction, i saw a large almost fireball with a streak or tail. At first, I thought it was a comet. the tail was not very long and moved with the ufo. It appeared at first very large and as if falling straight to the ground. It was somewhat high above the horizon, I would say I had to look up 45 degrees from level to see it dead on. It appeared to move slowly and we tracked the object for some 5 mins. The object then changed direction heading almost directly west. it also appeared to be getting lower and lower towards the horizon as some tree's were obstructing our view once and a while. when the object changed direction, the tail did not follow immediately. while the object changed direction, the tail continued in its original direction making the objects tail look bent or curved. The object then followed that course until it was too far below the treeline for us to spot it. During the drive i attempted to video tape the object with my friends digital camera however it did not have zoom and the object cannot be seen. We were simply curious to know what exactly the object was."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7539.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7539.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/28/2007 09:05 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07292007-0003","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/28/2007 09:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","City":"Troy","Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan","Latitude":"42.605589","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"7539","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.605589,+-83.14993(7539)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7539) map </A>","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Troy","There were no other sightings in Troy on or around July 28th 2007"],"Longitude":"-83.14993","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"fireball with short tail/trail"}
