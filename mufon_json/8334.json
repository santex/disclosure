As the object came closer it looked more narrow then an egg, and it was bright orange on the top and bottom and dark in the middle, and as it went by I could hear the plane very clearly but not any noise from the object, it lasted about 20 to 25 secounds and there were no blinking lights from the time I saw the object. Only when the object, was just out of sight I could see a orange light blinking on the right side(towards the west), and the object headed South-west.
