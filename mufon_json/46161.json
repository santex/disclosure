Block-looking metal-looking heavy looking very high up. 3 times size of an airliner.","Object Features":"None","City":"Las Vegas","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving to work... stuck in traffic. Looked off to my left (NW) and noticed a very odd looking shape just sitting in the air... very very high up, above the airliners flying under. I could see how huge it was compared to the airliners. It wasn't moving at all... and about 30 seconds after I was staring at it... it leaped up to the right and was GONE within a millisecond! I'm still in shock. I know what I saw. I'd like to know if anyone else saw it... and cannot believe for a second I was the only one who noticed it. It was very high up... but was very clear. I know what I saw. It was NOTHING that we could build. Nothing vanishes that fast... and especially when it's that massive. Please call me if you know what it could have been! Thank you!
