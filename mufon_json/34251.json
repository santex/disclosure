I reported this same thing two days ago. I've been viewing it now for three days. It's in orbit. It's not a \"V\" shaped craft like you portrayed on the site. It's still flashing all the colors I mentioned before that I can see with my naked eye. My binoculars sharpen up the image a bit but it's still star sized. I've never seen it before three days ago when I first reported it. I don't know if it's one of ours or extraterrestrial. The orbit hasn't changed. I'd like to know what this is. I've checked youtube for new video's but no luck. Everyone should be able to see this on a clear night."],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
