I had a paper route in Peoria when I was 14 and was getting near the end and was just walking down the middle of the street with my paper bag and folding a paper up for the next house. I happened to be looking up in the sky which as I said was still dark. I remember it was mostly cloudy and beyond that I could see alot of stars then I was what I thought was a falling star because it had a tail on it and I though cool a falling star. but then a split second later I saw five more lights shoot across that opening in the clouds going in the same direction as the \"falling star.\" So I've always wondered if what I thought was a falling star was something more like a UFO in trouble because as I said the first light had a tail on it whereas the other five did not."],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/15/1974 05:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Peoria","There were no other sightings in Peoria on or around September 15th 1974"],"City":"Peoria","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.697149,+-89.584706(10853)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10853) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05202008-0028","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10853.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10853.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-89.584706","Case Number":"10853","Summary":"UFO's chasing a UFO in distress","Date of the Event":"09/15/1974 05:30 UTC"}
