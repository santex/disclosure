{"divs":["sighting detailsi was walking from my shop in the backyard to my house i looked up in the night sky to look at stars like i always do and saw this bright red\\orange circle. i yelled for my wife to come outside and i used my phone to record it. after a minute the light disappeared. it appeared to be going toward outerspace in the southwest night sky. it looked like maybe the fire you would see from a rocket or missile but i checked every web site i could and the only missile that day was in south korea which i wouldnt see from my house. im just curious if something was launched i live by march air reserve base but i would've heard a missile lift off. the beginning of the video is moving alot because i was trying to zoom in once i did the video is better viewable."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"12/04/2012 06:33 UTC","Latitude":"33.935989","Longitude":"-117.253022","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Other","Case Number":"44314","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","City":"Moreno Valley","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Moreno Valley","There were no other sightings in Moreno Valley on or around November 29th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"I looked up in the nightsky and saw a bright reddish orange circle","Date of the Event":"11/29/2012 10:07 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.935989,+-117.253022(44314)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44314) map </A>","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44314.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44314.html"],"Log Number":"US-12042012-0003"}
