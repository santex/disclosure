It was twelve noon, in front of me, and descended on an approximate 45 degree angle towards the Atlantic Ocean. It was very bright with a small tail. Possibly from the setting sun to the west?? More than likely it was a meteor, but a very interesting daylight sighting of some sort. Did anyone else see it?"],"Date of the Event":"12/18/2008 04:54 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/18/2008 04:54 UTC","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-12182008-0009","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14458.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14458.html"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Florida"}
