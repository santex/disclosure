{"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"what appeared to be 25+ bubbles bunched together moving erratically overhead except they made a humming sound which made me look up.","Longitude":"-84.138983","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting Detailswe moved to the northwest corner of forsyth county right before the new year. we have a large lot and my wife wanted to clear out the overgrown woods of the back of the property. so most days she would pull out thorny vines and small trees and I would burn them in a burn barrel. It was in feburary one day around lunch time and I was manning the burn barrel when I heard a quiet humming sound. Now it's very quiet here except for the rustling of trees, so this humming sound made me look around to see what was causing it. It appeared to be coming from overhead. There were approximately 25 small orbs, in a cluster but moving erratically between themselves.They appeared to look like bubbles , looking translucent, then reflecting light as they intermingled. After I saw them I was thinking if I should even say something to my wife who was 50 feet away pulling vines. I knew she'd say I was crazy so I just looked in her direction and saw that she was observing them also. They appeared to be fairly low and we didn't see them for more than 15-20 seconds before they were too small to see. They drifted or flew from the south to the north, stayed bunched together but crisscrossed each other. I'd say they might have been soap bubbles somehow, except for the quiet humming sound that accompanied them. Several hours later the same sound and bubbles flew by in the same direction again for a short duration. We have not seen them any other time. I was just curious if any one else has seen something like this."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Cumming","There were no other sightings in Cumming on or around February 6th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.20937,+-84.138983(42152)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42152) map </A>","Region":"Georgia","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42152.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42152.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/06/2012 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"42152","City":"Cumming","Date Submitted":"08/30/2012 10:42 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-08302012-0014","Latitude":"34.20937"}
