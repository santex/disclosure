Like a straight path was cut through the cloud without explanation. (See picture 1). The only plain in the area was not angled properly to have came from.that path. Then to my amazement as I watched a second, parallel path began to form through the cloud next to the first cutting from east to west towards me. Again no explanation for what was unfolding. See pic 2 for beginning of second \"plowed path\" through clouds. Pic three shows the completely cleared path still with no planes anywhere near formation of second path."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.408695","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
