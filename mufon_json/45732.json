Various witnesses pulled over watching them.","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home heading west on loop 1604 in San Antonio. I was talking to my wife on the phone when I see a shooting star. I hang up with my wife and continue driving. I noticed cars on the side of the road but I thought they had just broken down. I then turn north and witness more cars pulled over. I turn west again and look up and see a cluster of red lights in the sky. I try my best not to take my eyes off of the them. I pull over and grab my iPhone and attempt to take video. The video only shows black since camera phones are meant to record at such distances. I observe the objects moving in different directions. One starts to pick up speed and is moving directly over me. The rest are still clustered together. The light above me suddenly disappears. I continue observing the cluster but they seem to be fading away one by one. Suddenly they are all gone."],"Log Number":"US-02162013-0010","Longitude":"-98.492288","City":"San Antonio","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45732.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45732.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.431342,+-98.492288(45732)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45732) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Sphere","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around February 16th 2013"]}
