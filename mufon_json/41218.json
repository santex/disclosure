On July 25th approximately 1:30 P.M. he, his sister, and mother were traveling by car on loop 375 thru the military base Fort Bliss. He looked out the window and he saw a black saucer shaped craft flying around El Paso very fast. Another Saturn shaped ball white with black patches all around it was also along the same flight path. Neither object made noise or left any exhaust trail. The Saturn like object pulsated in brightness. The rings around the Saturn like object went inside itself. The ball shrunk until it disappeared. After that, the black object flew away abruptly at a very high speed. My son was the only observer. He immediately experienced a burning and dry sensation on his right outer cheek."],"Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None, Patterned Surface","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
