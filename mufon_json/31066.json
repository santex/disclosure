After I told him that the Shuttle had its final launch, he said that he saw 2 airplanes flying side by side. I went outside to look and saw a bright light traveling east to west on a straight flight path that disappeared in the clouds.. Then another one came from the same direction and again disappeared in the clouds. We witnessed this 7 times. Very strange. As one disappeared, another appeared traveling very fast out of nowhere."],"Log Number":"US-08212011-0010","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-82.566219","City":"Bradenton","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"31066","Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Bradenton","There was one other sighting in Bradenton on or around August 20th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.502398,+-82.566219(31066)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31066) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/20/2011 08:49 UTC","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"27.502398","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
