{"Longitude":"-77.055893","divs":["Sighting DetailsI don���t remember the exact date, I saw a report in tv about ufos , I always found it interesting and I saw this shape like an egg but flat more like oval it was like the sun and very shining in that moment I thought , I have seen this , but I could���nt remember where o when , I saw the tv program about ufos like 2 times more and I felt the same sensation about having seen that before , and I thought it was from those tv reports , but one day after maybe years from the last day I saw the tv reports, I was at home and suddenly I had like a flash back and I saw it clearly in my mind I remember being at home in my garden with my oldest brother and my neighbor , we were playing , we were young maybe 13 years old my self , where we lived in that time was very lonly , just a few houses and not to much neighbors, I remember looking up to the sky and point it with my finger and saying, look what is that!!! I saw that intense and yellow thing in the sky, it was giant it cover almost all the garden it felt like I could touch it, and after that moment after I had the flash back I remember where I saw that thing,it was from that time but I don���t remember anything else ,I tyed to remember more but I can���t I asked my brother and he does���nt remember anything, I really beleave I���ve been abducted, that moment is so clear in my mind. I don���t remember any fillings but I���m not scared of them. I remeber all this after many years from the time that it happend, if I was 13 I remembered it when I was 30 , something like that. The object was just on top of us, it didn���t move , I don���t know when or how it got there and I don���t remember how he left...
