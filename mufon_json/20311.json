{"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"A UFO Sighting At Raton, N.M.","divs":["sighting details11\\4\\09 i have never told anyone about seeing a ufo before, because it would be a story no person would ever believe. i have now decided to tell what i saw, after all of the evidence and eyewitness reports of other sightings by people over the years. the event happened when i was 18 years old, on a clear day with excellent visibility around 12 noon. unfortunately, there was no eye witness with me. during the summer of 1947, i was in the kitchen of my grandparent's house when i noticed a shadow suddenly flash across the house. in a couple of seconds, i was at the window staring at a flying saucer moving directly away from me and heading towards berrela mesa. i had never seen such a strange machine like this before. the saucer dove downward towards some strange looking sandstone outcroppings on the side of the mesa, and then nosed up to clear the mesa's rim. i was able to get a good view of the edge and top of the saucer before it made a turn to the right, and then flew south out of sight. there was no sound at all...not even a sonic boom. the saucer traveled extremely fast. here is my estimate of the size, appearance, and time of arrival to the rim of the mesa: the diameter of the ufo was about 60 feet, and the height of the bell-shaped bubble area was about 6 feet above the base. the ufo looked metalic with no windows. the distance to the mesa rim from my vantage point is about 4 miles, and the time for it to arrive there took about 12 seconds. therefore; the estimated speed had to be in the vicinity of mach 2. at first, i thought i was hallucinating. since i was of sound mind with excellent senses, the strange event i witnessed had to be real."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"New Mexico","Date of the Event":"07/31/1947 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Case Number":"20311","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.907658,+-104.436253(20311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20311) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.907658","Date Submitted":"11/04/2009 01:29 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11042009-0010","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Raton","There were no other sightings in Raton on or around July 31st 1947"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Raton","Longitude":"-104.436253","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20311.html"]}
