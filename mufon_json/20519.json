The sky was black. She looked up to the east, and saw three long bright lights (she held up her fingers in a W with the middle finger pointing up). She said it was very beautiful, with many colors. As she was watching, her neigbor came out and several others... and together they all stood and watched it... motionless... very high in the sky. All of them agreed it was nothing they could think of from this planet. I first thought that maybe it was the ISS... but that would not have stayed stationary. They watched about five minutes until it faded away... but \"for a few minutes it was very bright\" she said. She is now convinced... 'there are things up there'. It sounds to me a lot like a UFO picture I found on the Internet from China, dated Aug. 23, 2009. (Attached) though I have not shown this picture to her yet."],"Case Number":"20519","Country":"Nepal","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","City":"Korat","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.657334"}
