I then said \"mum, dad?\", as I said this the entity seemed to have realized that I had awoken and rose up from the crouched position and ceased what it was doing with its hands (the most I could see before it rose was its forehead and shoulders moving in a motion that would suggest movement with its hands, perhaps operating something) onto two feet and stood with its torso moderately bent over the bed. It then waved its two hands over my bed whilst facing me then slowly disappeared. During the experience I wasn't paralyzed or unable to move, but I felt I strong feeling to not harm or be afraid of the situation. After it had passed I stayed awake for several more minutes before going back to sleep."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"31910","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.974551,+145.039149(31910)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31910) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Beaumaris","There was one other sighting in Beaumaris on or around August 15th 2009"],"Country":"Australia","Summary":"entity in bedroom at night then vanished","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"-37.974551"}
