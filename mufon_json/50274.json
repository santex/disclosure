After I lit up, I start to stargaze like I usually do. Something odd caught my eye. An object, that I first thought maybe was a star, was moving around in odd directions and had three different lights on it. It looked like it was a few miles away. I figured it was a triangle because it had one on each \"end\". It would dart left and right, up and down, and did kind of a corkscrew at one point. A very feint trail was left after it moved. Eventually a second object moved in, and this one was much less bright, but still had some light coming off of it. Possibly the other one was damaged? They danced around with each other for about five minutes then stabilized. Both would occasionally move in the same direction. After about 10 minutes the movement slowed down and they both seemed to just be hovering. At that point I went inside and fell asleep. Weird night."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"50274","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50274.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50274.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/29/2013 02:37 UTC","Longitude":"-88.911774","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.081389,+-88.911774(50274)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50274) map </A>"}
