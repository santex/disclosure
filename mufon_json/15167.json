I turned to my friend to see if she noticed them and told me she had. We watched them as we drove down the highway, noticing that three of the lights started moving. As we drove the object was now behind us, being lost in the distance. I was immediately excited by the event and noticed in the next few days it was reported in the papers and seen by others, but in the papers it was dismissed as flares. Now i am a fan of the UFO hunters show and have seen demonstrations of this theory and i now what i saw where not flares. i know this is a short story, but i still would like an investigator to call me. thank you for your time"],"Date Submitted":"01/05/2009 08:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"New Jersey","Case Number":"15167","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-74.474004","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"While driving down Highway Rt. 24, I saw 5 strange red lights in the sky.","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.801787","City":"Morristown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Morristown","There were 3 other sightings in Morristown on or around January 5th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
