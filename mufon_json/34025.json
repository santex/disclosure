I first noticed the light because we were just looking at Venus above the horizon. When I looked back at Venus I observed what appeared to be an airplane but noticed no flashing tail lights. I initially thought it was a plane at high altitude, accounting for the lack of visual flashing lights. My friend and I both agreed though that an airplane at that high of an altitude would not appear to be moving at the speed that this object was traveling at (Faster than an airplane, slower than a meteorite). As we kept watching the object it traveled at a steady speed from the direction of Venus on the horizon towards the North East. As it traveled to near zenith above us it continuously dimmed to no luminosity and disappeared from view."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Bright light moving in straight path from South West to North East.
