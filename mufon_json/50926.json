I felt as though there was something near by watching me. I looked around and saw a human-like figure about 4ft tall standing motionless about three yards from the driver's side. It was somewhat transparent but I could easily make out its form. It had a small body with a large head with a distinct cleft running front to back on the top of its head. It didn't move as I approached it. I then got in my car and drove away. I've had many other encounters with creatures like this and beings of other sorts."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50926.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50926.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/20/2013 01:17 UTC"}
