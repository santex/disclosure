Witness and wife proceeded to the front door and went out to the front yard. Witness had a clear view of the sky and saw three streaks of light about 45 to 90 degrees from the horizon approximately 3 to 4 miles behind Normandy Farms. Witness is a retired policeman who now works with this FI in a different department. Witness indicates he had never seen anything like that in the night sky. When queried whether it was perhaps spotlights from a business, he indicated \"no\". Daughter and wife reportedly also saw the lights and they watched it for a few minutes. The streaks of light varied in brightness and did not appear to touch the horizon. Witness thought the news told him it was ice crystals, but he did not agree with the observation. Witness and family were puzzled by the event and told this FI after watching the episode on the BC flap on the Discovery Channel. Witness and family eventually returned inside the house after a few minutes watching the spectacle."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"11/18/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-75.274516","Case Number":"14177","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-12012008-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.245255,+-75.274516(14177)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14177) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/18/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Not Provided","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lansdale","There were no other sightings in Lansdale on or around November 18th 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Lansdale"}
