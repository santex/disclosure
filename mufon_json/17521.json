I was looking at the sky when I saw a craft suddenly appear as if out of thin air, or extremely fast. It hovered for a few seconds, then turned eastward and started accelerating, at which point I could see its full shape. It was a rectangle shaped craft which resembled a brick and emitted a very unusual light-brown glow. It had no wings, no tail, or any other features to suggest that this was an airplane. It had no lights anywhere on the craft, and was only visible from this dull glow that it emitted. The approximate size of the craft was 1000-1200 feet in length, about 500-600 feet wide, and about 250 feet tall. It made no noise and was totally silent as it accelerated quickly to the east at a speed at least twice as fast as a commercial airliner, I would estimate about 1200-1400 mph. Approximate altitude of the object was 8000-12000 feet. It accelerated to the east and vanished."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/16/2009 01:55 UTC"}
