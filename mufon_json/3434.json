Two of them were blinking between about eight different colors, including different shades of blue, red, and green, as well as several other colors. The lights hovered for a second, and then started zipping around really quickly. At one point, they were spinning at a pace so fast they seemed to blend into a yellow, which then shifted to different colors, I assume from the changing of the lights. The thing then flashed away. The lights never lit up the ground, but I noticed another driver near me point up into the sky before we had to drive away. My sister wasn t able to get the camera out of the glove compartment, despite my frantic waving and shouting. Part of the reason was that she didn t seem able to see it, although she was looking right at the thing."],"Log Number":"","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"3434","City":"Raleigh","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-78.632894","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"03/20/2005 02:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Raleigh","There were no other sightings in Raleigh on or around March 20th 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3434.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3434.html"],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.780646,+-78.632894(3434)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3434) map </A>","Region":"North Carolina"}
