I tell people about it and they laugh but thats the way it happened never saw anything like it again but it bothers me so much that I had to tell someone who might not find it so outrageous the location was of plain st in lowell mass by a factory that used to make plastic holders for vegetables and others things and traveling east to west i kept looking at it until it dissapered behind the tree line well i know its been a long time but just wanted to share my experience and thats what i remember well thanks for listening"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Chelmsford","There were no other sightings in Chelmsford on or around October 10th 1989"],"Summary":"it was a triangle","Log Number":"US-03252009-0010"}
