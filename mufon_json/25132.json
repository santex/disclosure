We thought it was a plane at first or a really bright planet on the horizon (which seemed unlikely), but it held its position, and at times got brighter or bigger and then dimmer or smaller. It was just to the right of the road, but way off in the distance. As we drove down the road and passed Lexington, another light joined it in the sky that one was smaller and lower and to the right of the first object. The second object had the same properties to the first and also seemed to pulsate extremely slowly. The second object disappeared shortly after it appeared, and by the time we reached Snelling Ave, both objects were gone seemingly getting smaller or more distant until they disappeared but constantly holding their position from our vantage point."],"Log Number":"US-08192010-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.014927,+-93.154631(25132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25132) map </A>","City":"Roseville","Region":"Minnesota","Latitude":"45.014927","Date Submitted":"08/19/2010 01:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Reflective object on the horizon.","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-93.154631"}
