Now let me tell you this sighting occurred right on Eglin AFB so it maybe some new technology, but...it was a very clear morning in the sunshine state and I am driving to work when I look up at about a 45 degree angle through the left side of my windsheild and a gold football shaped object appears in the sky. It was motionless and then seemed to roll over backwards and disappear. It just appeared and then disappeared. I say football shaped instead of a blimp because it was thicker in the middle as it tapered to each end. This took all of 4 seconds, but has left quite an impression."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04"}
