We were sitting by the window and my wife seen what appeared to be a string of balloons in a cluster toward the west of us. The objects went from a cluster to a straight line and my wife asked if they were balloons and I said they look like it. The wind was blowing from the west so we watched them to see if they came towards us. The objects then broke out of a straight line and 2 white and one red went north and the others went south. I thought this was strange and it then came apparent that these were not ballons when they came back together after being very far apart. They lined up again with the white objects on top and the red on the bottom. At this time more than ten people were watching the objects hovering in one spot. The red objects then merged with the white ones and they started moving west then disappeared. All of us who were watching were stunned at what we saw."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/02/2007 09:15 UTC","Case Number":"8042","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.381292,+-119.012822(8042)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8042) map </A>","City":"Bakersfield","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date of the Event":"10/02/2007 09:15 UTC"}
