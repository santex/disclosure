(obviously, it was a lot darker outside during my sighting than the sighting in the video, but everything else is similar). off to the right of the dipper formation, were four objects in no particular order or formation that slowly moved together to form a crescent shape or half circle. during this time, the dipper formation stayed in place, with all objects now dimming in and out. eventually, the object at the bottom of the crescent began to flash wildly, first in it���������s ���������natural��������� color, then in dark red and blue. it struck me as sort of like a morse code, or signal of some kind, and i assume it was ���������communicating��������� to the dipper formation, at which point i got spooked and went downstairs to make coffee as this was all a bit too much for me to handle. i���������ve always been a skeptic about ufos and this has pretty much shaken up my whole world view. i can no longer deny that ufos exist. in the video link i provided, it appears that formation is regrouping into separate formations, and i can only assume that is the activity that i was witnessing, but i didn���������t stay to witness the whole incident because i was pretty shaken, so i can���������t say what eventually happened. when i worked up the courage to come back up to my bedroom and have a look out the window about a half hour later, both the dipper formation and half circle formation had gone, nowhere to be found. at first, i thought i was looking at stars, but then i noticed they were arranged like the big dipper, and i knew that the big dipper would not be that low in the sky or as bright as they appeared. i have not seen this dipper formation in the eastern sky before or since this particular evening."],"Latitude":"38.448837","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Santa Rosa","There were no other sightings in Santa Rosa on or around October 24th 2009"]}
