NO LIGHT EMMITING. FIRST, ONLY ONE SHOWED UP. BUT WE ARE TAKING PICTURES OF THEM EVERY DAY AND NUMBERS KEEP RAISING. MOST OF THE TIMES THEY CAN BE SPOTTED NEAR SATELITE ANTENAS OR ANY OTHER SIGNAL EMMITING DEVICES LIKE RADIOS AND CELL PHONES. THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANY SOUNDS. VARIOUS PICTURES FROM DIFERENT CAMERAS SHOW THE SAME SHAPES. ONE OF MY MEIGHBORS WASCLEANING HIS CAR AT NIGHT AND TAKING PICTUERS OF IT TO SELL IT ON THE INTERNET WHEN HE TOOK A PICTURE OF HIS BACK YARD HE NOTICED THE \"BALL SHAPPED\" OBJECT OVER A STABLE. HE SHOWED ME THE PICTURE AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOON, BUT QUICKLY I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS NO FULL MOON THAT DAY PLUS THERE ARE TREES BEHIND THAT STABLE.
