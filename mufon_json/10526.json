Clear sky at around 7:45 PM. The road was wide and had a very clear view of the sky, there was a very bright flickering light in the sky. At first thought it was a plane, but it was not moving, then thought to be a star, however it would have been the only star in the sky. Watched as driving for about 10-15 seconds, then looked down to the road for a moment. Looked back up and it was gone with absolutely no trace in sight. Pulled over for a moment and did not see it anywhere or hear any sounds. Definately not a plane, helicoptor, star, or planet. At first watching the object, I was curious of how bright and how much it was flickering, then when it was gone i got very nervous and an eerie feeling came over me."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-04242008-0023"}
