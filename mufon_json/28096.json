{"divs":["sighting details i was taking the garbage out and looked sout toward orion and noticed a slow moving shape passing through orion as i got my night vision i could see the outline of the object moving slowly from east to west. i could see the round lights along the bottom of the object in a delta\\triangular lay-out 3 on on side 1 on front. i watched as it moved toward the santa monica - lax area and los it in the glare of the city lights. it was a approx. 15,000 feet . i am accustom to seeing air traffic as it comes in from the pacific west and turns over the city to approach lax landing. radar should have picked it up as it is a very monitored air space on friday nights. it made no noise what so ever that i could hear. it has left me stunned and little shaken. it was definitely not a conventional craft."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"28096","Latitude":"34.057234","Summary":"Triangle shape with 7 round lights along the perimiter","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28096.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28096_submitter_file1__UFODRAWING.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28096.html"],"Date of the Event":"03/04/2011 07:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.057234,+-118.233735(28096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28096) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Los Angeles","Log Number":"US-03042011-0019","Date Submitted":"03/04/2011 10:49 UTC","Region":"California","Longitude":"-118.233735","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around March 4th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
