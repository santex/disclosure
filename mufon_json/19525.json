When I snapped the shot it was of the signage located in Lafayette, Indiana on Creasy Lane east of SR 38 about 500 yards from a construction sites main drive on the west side of the Road. The Photograph is viewed from south to North. And I did not notice the Funnel cloud or the object at the time, my mind was on the signage. I question to you did the object drop from the Funnel Cloud? Did it cause the Cloud? just for your eyes."],"trends":[""],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 11:34 UTC","Log Number":"US-09202009-0065","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19525.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19525_submitter_file1__securedownload.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19525.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Windy, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
