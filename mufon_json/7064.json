We have no streetlights in out area, so the stars are very visable. I caught something to my right out of my perifial vision - something like red lights. I thought maybe some kids were shining a red flashlight or something. I turned to look, then stood up and stepped out farther onto the patio to get a good look. It was two bright red lights (dots) traveling together across the sky. My first thought was it was a plane, as we have a lot of jets flying over, so I'm use to seeing those. Also, no sound - I would have heard jets at that level. This looked a lot closer. I told my friend to come see, and by the time she got there, they had disappeared. They were quite bright, and then just totally disappered. I was stunned, to say the least. I just said \"What was THAT?\" I don't know if maybe it was some sort of low meteor, but I've seen quite a few and none of them looked like that. I just was bewildered."],"Latitude":"41.539371","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.138313","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/17/2007 09:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Blair","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.539371,+-96.138313(7064)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7064) map </A>","Region":"Nebraska","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Blair","There was one other sighting in Blair on or around May 17th 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"05/17/2007 09:15 UTC"}
