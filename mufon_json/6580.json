Discovered when photo was enlarged on computer recently. I still work for the company and request all people be blocked out. I have copies of the photo before and after the one with the UFO. This photo was taken by another unknown employee and placed on the company computer. I am in the photo and I have no recollection of any abnormal sounds at the time. This is one of the best UFO photos I've seen and I think it may be good for research and identification."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ames","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-03192007-0004","Summary":"UFO discovered on old photo","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6580.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6580_submitter_file1__6580_submitter_file1__Liberty04-8a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6580_submitter_file2__6580_submitter_file1__Liberty04-8b.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6580_submitter_file3__Enhanced.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6580.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/10/2004 12:54 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
