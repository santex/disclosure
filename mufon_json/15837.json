As I stepped out of the house with my son and girlfriend, I looked up in the sky and noticed a bright, round object in the sky. I looked to my girlfriend and asked she if she knew what it was. She said no. We continued up the street and I decided to look back to see if it was still there. It was still there, but higher in the sky. We got to our destination a few minutes later. ..About 2 hours later we left our friends house, looked into the sky and it was gone! Stars don't move like that!? ..The next day, after dark, another friend came over. We went out to smoke a cigarette, and I went around the corner of my house to look to the sky to see if it was still there. My friend looked at me and \"Oh, you saw that too?\" I said \"Saw what?\" and then he described exactly what I had seen the night before. Him and his girlfriend had witnessed the object moving back and forth in the sky. ..Was not a star, plane, balloon, bird, or any other government explanation. ..anyone else from Ohio see the object?"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.989674","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.970736","Date Submitted":"01/03/2009 07:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-03042009-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.970736,+-82.989674(15837)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15837) map </A>","trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around January 3rd 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Columbus","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15837.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15837.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc"}
