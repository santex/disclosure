{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving on pershing road in stickney Illinois at around 1:15 am , on Saturday September 25, 2011. I noticed three flickering lights moving slowly across the sky. I pulled over to the side to observe the objects. They looked like about airplance distance. Not an airplane too high or low. The three lights were following each other and began going up higher. I was in disbelief and thought about my cell phone.I took two pictures and videotaped what I could.The three circles looked like they were in a triangular form.They went from bright orange reddish to white. It was a cloudy night so the objects slowly moved behind the clouds and I could no longer see them."],"Date Submitted":"09/26/2011 07:19 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.821421","City":"Stickney","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32115.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32115_submitter_file1__316.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32115.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"Illinois","Date of the Event":"09/25/2011 01:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.821421,+-87.782834(32115)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32115) map </A>","Summary":"Three flickering lights in the sky was unbelievable, I heard no sound and saw nothing else.","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Stickney","There were no other sightings in Stickney on or around September 25th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"32115","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09262011-0021","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.782834"}
