{"Longitude":"-117.877999","divs":["sighting detailsi was coming over the 73 toll road (at the highest point) on the road. i looked straight ahead and saw a sphere-like shiney object in the sky. i watched it as i also kept my eye on the road for a good 5 minutes until the object entered a cloud. i continued watching the cloud while driving waiting for the object to reappear which never occurred. i compared the shape of the object to the airplanes which were arriving and departing at john wayne airport. the airplane wings were visible and had no shine unlike the object. i called my wife when the object did not reappear and told her i had just seen a ufo. i couldn't believe it but at the same time i knew it wasn't a plane. by that time, i was already north bound on the 405 fwy. i did some research online hoping somebody had reported seeing something unusual on the same day but found nothing. when i discovered this site, i looked at photos from a previous sighting in orange county. i could not believe it when i saw the photo taken on 06\\20\\99--it was the exact object i had witnessed."],"City":"Newport Beach","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8457.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8457.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/16/2007 04:30 UTC","Latitude":"33.609598","Summary":"UFO over Orange County, CA","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/16/2007 04:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.609598,+-117.877999(8457)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8457) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Log Number":"US-11252007-0014","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"8457","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Newport Beach","There were no other sightings in Newport Beach on or around November 16th 2007"]}
