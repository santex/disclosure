I noticed a bright white light appear on the western horizon and tracked it steadily east until it disappeared again over horizon. WAY too bright to be a satellite, stars were not yet visible. No flashing or blinking FAA lights, no sound. I went inside & grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look - to the naked eye object appeared to be a single white light, however when viewed through binoculars object was five lights arranged in a circular pattern."],"Summary":"Flyby","Region":"Colorado","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/09/2012 08:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"39304","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Mancos","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39304.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39304.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.354446,+-108.285299(39304)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39304) map </A>"}
