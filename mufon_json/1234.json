It was extremely windy outdoors, but the sky was very clear. As I wasdriving down our rural road along the ridge of a mountain, I noticed somethingin the sky which, upon initial observation, appeared to be a plane with itsinterior lights on. UPon closer observation, there were actually two rows ofbluish-green lights with a very bright strobe-like light in the center. Thething that struck me the most was that this object was stationary in the sky,although it seemed to be the height of an airplane. I got out of the car,something I NEVER do when driving alone (I usually have all my doors locked whenIm driving) to get a clearer look, and then really realized that this was noordinary thing I was looking at. Got into the car and tried calling my husband,but as I was dialling and watching, the thing made a right angle turn away fromme, shot out a spurt of light, and disappeared."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/20/2001 02:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/20/2001 02:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.420387","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"two rows of horizontal blue/green lights with a la","Longitude":"-82.904773","Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1234.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1234.html"],"Case Number":"1234","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Windy","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.420387,+-82.904773(1234)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1234) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
