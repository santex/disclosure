I first noticed a red glow far off in the distance south of me. I at first thought it must have beel a plane banking or something because there's lots of air traffic around here. I kept chatting with my neighbor and after a few minutes I noticed it was still in the same general area and still only red. So I started watching it while we kept talking. I noticed it wasen't flashing but it was pulsing. I was able to tell it was moving very slow. I started thinking of what it could be. I've seen plenty of satelites and this was moving much much slower and pulsing red. So I kinda thought that was out. No blue or white and it wasen't flashing like a plane either so planes were out. Same with the helios around here. I had my camera in my pocket so I pulled it out and snapped a couple of shots and shot a couple of videos. All still talking to my neighbor. Then I asked him to take a look and he said that it was kinda strange also. He sat back down and we continued to talk. It kept moving slowly to the north. At one point I thought it had stopped but I think that was because I was watching it on me camera screen. Finally when it dissappeared it faded like the Space station does. It just dimmed out and was gone. The whole sighting lasted better than 25 minutes. I got 6 minutes on digital video. My camera isin't very good quality in the dark like that but it turned out better then I expected it would. The first snap shot was distorted because I flinched a bit when I took it and the other isin't very clear for some reason but the videos make out better. I thought afterwards that it moved kind of like a ballon would have. Attach a pulsing red light to a ballon and let it go. That might do it but the way it faded diden't seem to fit. I diden't catch the moment that I lost it because I coulden't hold the camera on it any more and I shut it off. It was kind of fun watching it. I don't know what it was."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"El Cajon","Case Number":"17971","Date Submitted":"07/07/2009 09:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"07/07/2009 09:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-116.958957","Summary":"Red Pulsing light moved very slowly accross the sky","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
