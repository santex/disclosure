There were many birds flying around. Then I saw a very shinny silvery object that was not moving. It looked like a giant gum drop from afar. Or rather a bell shape object. I continued driving and then my view was blocked by a tree then I was able to see it again after I passed the tree and it moved quickly to the right and then out of no where, it disappeared. There were no clouds or airplanes in the sky. I was surprised at first. I wasn't scared or worried. I just accepted it."],"Summary":"It was a bell shape.
