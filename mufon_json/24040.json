{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my house watching tv,and my mother called me outside.She was taking the dog out,and saw something odd in the sky.I went out there and we saw what seemed to be a triangular shape object.At first we thought it was an airplane,untill we saw that it had 3 white lights on the bottom,in the shape of a triangle also.It seemed to also have a small red light in the front,that blinked.It also would go to the right slightly,then go back to a straight path.Then it would go to the left,and go back into a straight path again. It only did that once for each direction though.I believe this was a UFO,cause it made no noise,and seeemed to just hover across the sky. I have seen UFO's before,and this seemed to be similar to my other acounts aswell."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Diamond, Triangle","Region":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24040.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-73.990251","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.929667,+-73.990251(24040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24040) map </A>","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Kingston","There were no other sightings in Kingston on or around June 29th 2010"],"Summary":"Clear Skies around 10-11 pm.","Log Number":"US-06302010-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Kingston","Latitude":"41.929667","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/29/2010 10:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"24040","Date Submitted":"06/30/2010 10:15 UTC"}
