I pulled off the freeway to get my binoculars out and was curious to see what exactly it was. When I did so all I could see was a glow of orange in a something like glass ball. The one light farthest away dimmed out and disappeared and then the 2nd one did the same. Amazed, I started back onto the streets when I noticed 2 more glowing orange orbs. I then pulled over again and tried to take my camera out to record but those too dimmed and disappeared. When looking through the binoculars I did not see any blinking lights to indicate an airplane. And these moved very slowly and disappeared. Crazy! Dont know if anyone else saw. Lots of people out tonight too with lighting up fireworks. I saw the first 2 lights at 10:29pm and the 2nd lights at 10:37pm."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.755003,+-117.865994(29966)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29966) map </A>","Case Number":"29966"}
