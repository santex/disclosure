I noticed a very small but bright flashing light of colors. I grabbed my 8MP camera with a 200MM Telephoto lens and took a few shots. I did my best to keep still but maybe the slight shift is me or the object. Either way the color are clear and the shapes are unusual. Didn't seem right to me when I checked these out on the computer. Took me awhile to share but I hope this helps. In the photo there are two samples of the same image on each photo. The top left is the original and the close up is about 400% zoom. Both are clear and beautiful."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-87.624608","Date of the Event":"04/05/2010 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.887644,+-87.624608(26114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26114) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Chicago","Log Number":"US-10252010-0016","Case Number":"26114","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"10/25/2010 11:36 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There was one other sighting in Chicago on or around April 5th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"Unusual bright flashes of colors","Region":"Illinois"}
