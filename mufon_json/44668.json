{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsThird sighting in a week. This object was unlike my first two reported sighting. It had two red blinking lights one would blink then the second in sequence. about 2 seconds apart. It moved silently through he air. Look as though it was following interstate 16 as it went by. It was a fairly large object and traveled much faster than commercial planes in comparison to speed. An example would be a single prop Cessna : an airliner , as the airliner : this UFO respectively. The spacing between the lights was quite large I would think 300ft to 400ft in length. I have been seeing strange crafts in this area now for weeks and have been making a habit of staying out at night looking for them. After the craft was out of visual range more air traffic filled the skies and what sounded like a jet once again would be heard about 20 minutes after it left the area."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Danville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44668.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44668.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.61126,+-83.243906(44668)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44668) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Large object moving from SE to N","Region":"Georgia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/20/2012 12:20 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"32.61126","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Danville","There were no other sightings in Danville on or around December 19th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"12/19/2012 11:25 UTC","Case Number":"44668","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12202012-0001","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-83.243906"}
