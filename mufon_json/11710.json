The two of us then walked out onto my porch, as soon as we walked outside a huge red flash alluminated a small portion of the sky. We looked at one another, at which point another large flash occured. There was five flashes seperated by a period of about 10 seconds. At this point, we both ran into the middle of the street and were staring over a large tree across the street at the flashes. Around the third of fourth flash we could see a dark area in the area of the flash. We were not certain that it was an object but it was illuminated by the flashes. After the fifth flash subsided, there was nothing to be seen in the sky, besides dark clouds. Both of our reactions to this object were the same, complete shock. It was unlike anything else we had ever seen. My friends name is Shakir Green."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11710.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11710.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.16175","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright red and orange flashes in sky, followed by a dark object instantly disappearing","Date Submitted":"07/23/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"07/23/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Levittown","There were no other sightings in Levittown on or around July 23rd 2008"],"Longitude":"-74.819575","Case Number":"11710","City":"Levittown","Log Number":"US-07242008-0017","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Source":"MUFON"}
