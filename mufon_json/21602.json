I have a sister who lives in Anchorage and had a sighting, but she doesn���t like to use computers. Therefore I will am typing out the report for her from my home in Albia, Iowa. My telephone number is 641-932-5788. SIGHTING: On 12-9-09, Wednesday, at 2 a. m., witness had just finished wrapping Christmas presents and took the trash outside to the trash receptacle. She always looks up into the sky on clear nights to observe what stars or planets might be visible. She noticed a plane high in the sky, overhead, but above the normal flight patterns which sometimes take planes over her house. However, there was no noise, even as the light, which was traveling in a southeast direction, came lower and appeared to come within a mile or less of her and southwest of her. It stopped and hovered in line of sight of two spruce trees, which she used as markers. It was about 45��� in altitude and stayed in the same place for 10-15 minutes, for the rest of the sighting. Then the witness, who was in her shirtsleeves, went inside to escape the cold, which was about 13���. The light, which was steady and white, appeared to be ��� to ��� inch wide at arm���s length. There was no structure. Her dog was asleep in the kitchen and never responded during the event. Witness said she talked to the object. (It didn���t talk or respond back.) She said such things as ���Oh, you���re a UFO. Now I can tell my brother I���ve seen one.��� and ���Good-bye. I���m cold now and I���m going inside.���"],"Summary":"Bright light moved from overhead to southeast, descended, and hovered for 15 minutes","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-01232010-0011","Latitude":"61.222536","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City"}
