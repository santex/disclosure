{"Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/07/2009 10:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were watching the space station going across the sky when a smaller light appearing to be in the same orbit appeared approximately 10 seconds behind the space station. The smaller light suddenly disappeared when it was just below the big dipper. As we live on a hill we were able to watch the Space Station as it disappeared in the horizon. The smaller light did not reappear. We often observe satellites from this location. The sky was clear with only wispy clouds that didn't interfer with our observation. Was this another satellite trailing the space station? We've never seen this one before, or a satellite to just suddenly disappear in the dark of night."],"Date of the Event":"07/07/2009 10:05 UTC","Case Number":"17928","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17928.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17928.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","City":"Nashville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.16869,+-86.778273(17928)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17928) map </A>","Country":"United States","Region":"Tennessee","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07072009-0034","Longitude":"-86.778273","trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around July 7th 2009"],"Latitude":"36.16869","Summary":"Light behind space station while observing"}
