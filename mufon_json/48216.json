I knew it was something that I had never seen before. It was very large and it glowed like the moon or a 60 watt light bulb. No sound no other lights. It was moving from the North going south. I last saw it by an electric tower. I knew I had captured something so I had a sense of satisfaction however, I didn't download or view the photos because I felt I needed permission and they were not to be viewed at that time. I am a very nosey person by nature. This was on Tuesday and I felt I was given permission to view them on the following Saturday. I didn't think the photos were that good and I was having trouble viewing them and downloading on my new computer I became frustrated and sort of gave up. I'm not sure why but I felt this strong need to look at them again last night. I was able to resolve all the problems that had precluded me from viewing them. I know what I saw and felt and it was something I will never forget. I am very open to many things and I just want someone else to look at what I saw that night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48216.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48216.html"],"Latitude":"36.786201","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON"}
