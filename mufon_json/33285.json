My father had recently become interested in telescopes and had purchased a few over the past weeks. This particular November night we had two of the telescopes out in my parent���s front yard in Alvin, Texas. One was a new 5 inch refractor telescope that my father had just purchased and the other was an 8 inch Dobsonian style telescope that I had preferred using for my leisure after becoming comfortable with it over a couple of weeks. Alvin is south of Houston and from our front yard the light pollution was enough to cause some frustrations when trying to find various objects; however, one reason I preferred the Dobsonian was because I could rather easily pick up some gas formations such as the nebula in Orion (M42). It was between 12 and 1 am and the telescopes had been placed outside a few hours earlier to allow for acclimation to the weather. My father had been fooling with setting up his new telescope while I had already gazed at M42 and become bored. I was looking through the viewfinder and traversing the skies when I picked up my ���UFO.��� Even through the viewfinder of a fairly powerful front yard telescope the object appeared just as a distant star would; as a tiny speck of light. The object had a greenish-white color that didn���t sparkle like a starts burning gases would. It appeared just as a planet would to the naked eye; as a constantly bright light. The objects intensity was only outdone by the star Sirius. My picking up of the object must have been much by sheer luck and accident because it was moving across the night sky in an unusual pattern. As soon as I located the object at roughly due east I began following its movement in a circle around the night sky. It is this movement that made the object peculiar to me. I will explain it like this: Imagine tying a ball to a string and spinning it around in a counterclockwise fashion above your head. The ball will rotate the central point of your body on the ground in a circle whose circumference is dictated by the length of the string. This is how the object moved. Imagine that the center point was where I was standing on the ground looking at this object through the telescope. The object moved in a circle across the night sky over my head as if tethered to a string. Again, I caught the object in the viewfinder at roughly due east. The object moved at a consistent speed and altitude around the sky in a circle first south, then west, next north, east again���and so on. I followed the object at least six times around the same path in the sky. If a pencil had been taped to the bottom of the telescope and a paper under it I would have drawn a perfect circle on the paper with the motion of the telescope. I would estimate the telescope was at between a 70 and 80 degree angle to the ground. At first I thought I may be tracking the space station. However, I quickly discounted this because it is my assumption that an object in orbit would not create such a path. Although I could possibly pick up an object in orbit I would have lost it over the horizon as it continued its path. This object was not orbiting the earth it was creating a giant perfect circle (as much as I could tell) in the sky above me. There are two large airports in the Houston area; Hobby is a hub for commercial flights, and depending on wind conditions we would frequently get aircraft in pattern that would fly over nearby. In fact, on this night the 737s were coming right across our sky. These planes could be picked up in the telescope by chance, but they moved so fast (even in landing patterns) that it was impossible to keep them in view through the telescope. I had even managed to pick up Cessnas and similar aircraft, but because of the power of the telescope in question these too were nearly impossible to track because they would nearly take up the entire view finder when you did lock on to one. I���ve also observed plenty of meteors through the very telescope in question, and these objects do not represent the type of movement I witnessed. I lost the object when I attempted to get my father to track it. It would move through the entire 360 degrees of its motion in about 45 seconds, so I lost it and wasn���t able to reacquire it when my father passed on taking a look. At the time I thought nothing of it. Like I said, I assumed I was looking at the space station or a satellite; however, after some time passed I began to question this assumption based on my understanding of how these objects orbit the earth. I am admittedly ignorant of the details of how manmade objects such as satellite orbit the earth, but I was confident that even if these objects were capable of the flight path I observed they would be moving too fast to even begin to be able to follow around the sky for several minutes. Keeping the object in view was taking some concentration and careful adjustment that was possible only by the design parameters of a Dobsonian telescope. Had it been any other telescope I am confident I would have lost it early on."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.424927,+-95.235801(33285)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33285) map </A>","Latitude":"29.424927","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33285.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33285.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/11/2011 11:13 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-95.235801","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","City":"Alvin","Source":"MUFON"}
