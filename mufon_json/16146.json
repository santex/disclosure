Then while I was looking east at an 80 degree angle or so above me I saw what looked to be a flare. But it was too far up and traveled too far to be that. What I saw of it, it burned a bright deep green for 2-3 seconds. It traveled in a straight line. I think NNE to SSW. Then looked like it burned out. After it was over I looked around for a few seconds then ran up stairs to tell my girlfriend."],"Date Submitted":"03/21/2009 02:32 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16146.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16146.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Louisiana","Case Number":"16146","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Belle Chasse","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Green fire ball.","Country":"United States","Latitude":"29.854929","Date of the Event":"03/21/2009 02:32 UTC","Longitude":"-89.990625","City":"Belle Chasse","Object Shape":"Fireball","Log Number":"US-03212009-0004"}
