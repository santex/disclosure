I immeadiatly noticed a triangular shaped object slightly higher then the street lights. It was pulsating bright white, yellow, red and blue lights streaming down each edge of the object one at a time. I could not believe what I was looking at so I stood there for a few minutes all awhile it was slightly swaying back and forth and moving forward. I went to wake my husband and had him step outside to see it as well. At that time I noticed 2 others in the sky. These were quite a distance from each other. The first one I noticed was north to me and one east and one south. These seemed much higher up but I could still see the pulsating colored lights. My husband blamed it on Camp Blanding and went back to bed. I could not sleep and went back inside and watched some tv for about 30 minutes then went back out to see if it was still there. It was but further away."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36627.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36627.html"],"Latitude":"29.993838","Longitude":"-81.675117","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Green Cove Springs","There were no other sightings in Green Cove Springs on or around March 19th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Florida"}
