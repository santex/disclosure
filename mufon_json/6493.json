Years before I had aquired a habit of looking at the stars in the sky overall and to look for what I called lights that would not move with the star patterns and this identified them as object based lights. Los Vegas was approximately 20 miles or so away. The light was on the left of the highway and you could see the road leading up to a small tower type affair. The light was approximately 1000 to 500 feet above the ground. I spotted it about 10 miles out before I came to the source. The light was above the mountains. The odd thing here was that it was the day before Thanksgiving late in the evening. The light was near a Tower and very bright like a star. The oddest thing was that there were about 2 dozen or so new SUVs parked on the road at the base of the tower. This has bothered me for quite awhile. I stopped the car looked at what I saw and then drove off."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
