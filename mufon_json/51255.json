My Mother-in-Law and I were driving west on Parallel, in Kansas City, Ks. headed towards the Legends, shopping center. My GPS said in .2 of a mile exit right onto 435 south, which made me look upward towards the highway sign. The sky was blue and cloudless. I saw a glimmering silver narrow rectangular shaped object flying north, or to the right in the sky. It was high up. I said LOOK, to my Mother-in-law. As fast as I could blink twice it turned white. She saw it. Just that quickly a stream of white curled smoke came off the lower right side. Then it completely disappeared, even the smoke. I said, what in the world was that? ���She couldn't figure out what we saw either. The whole event was very fast, probably about a minute!"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10012013-0028","Summary":"Rectangle, sliver of an almond, slightly domed in center","Object Features":"Dome","Longitude":"-94.808267","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Kansas City","Date of the Event":"09/30/2013 01:50 UTC","Region":"Kansas","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
