Anyways thats what I encounterd in my life and would like to share it, Its Time to except what I seen, 1968 or 1969 it was summer, I have seen other things in the air, strange lights other occurances also, But they could be explained somewhat enugh to satify me, Like satelites, metors so on, But what I seen when I had no idea about aliens , Is amazing to me, So if someone else has had anything like that happen don't feel alone I am sure it happens all the time.....
