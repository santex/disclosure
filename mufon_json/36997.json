{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAbout 6 lights in a triangle shape evenly spaced. Appeared to be one craft. Hovered about 200 feet off the ground, hovered over local farm field above Hwy 164 and skyline Ave for approximately 3 minutes with extremely quiet jet engine sound. No rotor thump of that of a helicopter. I drove under it and it slowly flew away at about 30 mph, with no engine increase in sound. Clear night sky but I could not get a clear visual of the craft. I wouldn���t say its alien craft but I���ve never heard or seen anything like it before."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Waukesha","There were no other sightings in Waukesha on or around March 29th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"03/29/2012 10:10 UTC","Log Number":"US-03302012-0001","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Waukesha","Longitude":"-88.225911","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","Case Number":"36997","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.016488","Date Submitted":"03/30/2012 12:34 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.016488,+-88.225911(36997)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36997) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"6 light triangle hovering with very faint jet engine sound, not a helicopter.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36997.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
