I was laying on my back in a public skate park staring up at thesky.Incidentally, we were not suposed to be there. It was after hours.2. I always watch the sky at night. I like to watch shooting stars, etc.3. A shooting star, of which I have probably seen hundreds. However, it cameback on a second timestill not unusual for a shooting star. Then it came on a third time andskitttered wildly. Still, not unusual for a shooting star to careen around likeits fragments are bouncing off the atmosphere. However, it is very unulual tosee first a sustained bouncing around and then an extended and progressivelylonger and further angular roming followed by an eventual straighting out anddissapearing overt the horizon and out of sight. I pointed it out to my friend,who spotted it easily. It was a garden variety dance around in the sky for a bitand take off sparklingblinking with periodic fade-outs and fade-ins sighting,nothing unusual. I saw a few like it above lafe erie around 1990. I just wantedto report it in case some one needed corroberation.4."],"Date of the Event":"05/23/2004 12:33 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Athens","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Athens","There were no other sightings in Athens on or around May 23rd 2004"],"Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/23/2004 12:33 UTC","Log Number":""}
