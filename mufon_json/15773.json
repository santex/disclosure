I was looking across the street and saw a black disc flying slightly above a 40' pine tree in the field outside our house. It was only a few hundred feet away from me. It was very low. At first I thought it was a large frisbee or something. It wobbled and did not make any noise. It flew slowly across the street. still wobbling and went over some houses and went behind some trees for a second. Then it came back up over the trees and hovered and teetered at the same time without moving. Then it flew a few feet up at an angle and shot off. It vanished. I did not see where it went. It was just gone. It never made any noise. It was a light icy drizzle and cloudy. While I was watching, I did not know what to think. I just watched it. After it was gone, I realized what I had just seen and got upset and shaky and I cried. I was upset for awhile. I went in and drew what it looked like, the time, and looked for this sight."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.043994,+-84.498986(15773)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15773) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Date Submitted":"02/28/2009 06:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around February 28th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-02282009-0009","Case Number":"15773","Latitude":"38.043994","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Kentucky","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Lexington"}
