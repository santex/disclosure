My boyfriend noticed this very bright starlike object in the sky and asked me to look at it. We stood there and looked at it for 20 minutes and it did not move. We went inside and looked up what planets are visible tonight and found Venus to be prominent in the SW tonight. We showed our roommate the starlike objects and watched it for another 10 minutes and then went inside. I checked on the starlike thing every 10 minutes for 2 hours and then it simply was not there after a while."],"Summary":"Very bright light in the SW (first thought to be Venus)","Log Number":"US-11232013-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52394.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/23/2013 06:30 UTC"}
