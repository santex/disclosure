Twice in the 15 minutes I watched it dropped smaller orbs that would fall at a steady speed then go at a left angle, I doubled my eye piece which altered the strength to 16mm, and I saw much better detail, deffinatley round red and white orbs flashing. POSSIBLEY A WEATHER BALLON DROPPING FLARES but it was awsome to look at through my Big telescope!!"],"Date of the Event":"10/01/2008 06:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/01/2008 06:00 UTC","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12875.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12875.html"],"City":"Grass Valley","Summary":"I watched this object with my 10 inch DOBSOINIAN TELESCOPE","Longitude":"-121.058591","Log Number":"US-10012008-0015","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere, Square, Rectagular, Teardrop","Case Number":"12875","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.223101,+-121.058591(12875)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12875) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.223101","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
