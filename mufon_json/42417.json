I did not hear any noise or did I see any lights that would be on a comercial aircraft or military. my guess is item was larger than a aircraft carrier and was over 30,000 feet in altitude. I could not see thru the item in the sky it appeared to be solid. flew faster than anything I have ever seen in my 41 years of watching airplanes and shuttle launches."],"trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around September 9th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/09/2012 09:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-09092012-0019","Latitude":"32.654965","City":"Fort Worth","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-97.396423","Case Number":"42417","Date of the Event":"09/09/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.654965,+-97.396423(42417)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42417) map </A>"}
