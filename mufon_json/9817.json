He said theres something bright streaking across the horizon and he saw no less than 5 planes going after it. I looked but couldn't figure out what he was talking about. I ran in and got my camera around 6pm and took pics of the west horizon looking out somewhere towards Mailibu I think. I found the streaking object and followed it in zoom mode as I could see firey streaks coming off the end and saw it swerve right a bit too. I could see 2 streaks under it, probably from the aircraft chasing it. So it went south into some trees in my front yard and I lost it as it seemed to be going a bit downwards too."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.013888","Date Submitted":"03/03/2008 06:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/03/2008 06:00 UTC","City":"Malibu","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03032008-0012","Tags":"City"}
