We first felt an abundance of static electricity in the calmnight air. We stepped out of our tent to get some air when we saw numerousswirling lights. We were all very startled and stayed close together notknowing what to expect. We watched intensely as we saw the lights merge intoone and slowly descend into a clearing approximately 75 feet away. We walkedtowards the object and saw three beings walk out and slowly look over theircraft as if something was wrong with it. They beings looked man like but walkedin an exaggerated upright way and very stiffly. It was at this moment that wewere noticed and we all walked toward the beings against our wishes. It feltlike we were on a treadmill being drawn toward the craft. The next 45 minutesare very hurtful and make me sick to even think about. I will gladly speak tosomeone in person about the experience. We were all violated in different ways."],"Summary":"extremely scared","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"07/20/2003 10:18 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/20/2003 10:18 UTC","Case Number":"2566","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Cave Creek","There were no other sightings in Cave Creek on or around July 20th 2003"]}
