{"Summary":"A slow moving auburn light flying from southwest to northeast","Region":"Nevada","divs":["Sighting DetailsLeaving a fireworks show in Henderson NV. I decided to open my Sunroof. There to my amazement was a auburn, almost fire-like light traveling from Southwest to the northeast horizon. It lasted about 45 seconds. It looked like it was moving slow. I know it was really high so the traveling speed was fast and big. It gradually disappeared in the horizon. Believe it or not, this is the second sighting like this I've seen. I seen the same In alot bigger scale about 20 years ago in San Jose CA. It was alot slower and huge! Immediately we tuned to KGO radio. They were swamped with calls. KGO decided to call Moffit Field Navel base (which also housed NASA). They actually went on the air and said that it was a metallic object that burned up in the Earths atmosphere. The military actually knew about it. It was seen in 12 states.
