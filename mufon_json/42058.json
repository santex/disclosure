At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter, since I do see many in the area, but I noticed that there were no safety lights and it was more of one big white light rather than the light on the front of a regular aircraft. It was the same from the front bottom and back, which led me to believe that it was not a regular air craft. I filmed it with a regular point and shoot digital camera, so I taped a few planes afterwards as well. It was odd. This was in West San Jose near Leigh and West San Carlos. It was about 9pm on Sunday, August 26th. This was also much too low to be a Satellite, which I have seen many of and this was not one. I uploaded the footage to Youtube.Unfortunately, I did not have a tripod, but I did try to stabilize it on some stairs for part of the video."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.321334,+-121.925223(42058)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42058) map </A>","City":"San Jose","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/26/2012 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around August 26th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"08/27/2012 12:51 UTC"}
