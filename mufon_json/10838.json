{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe witness showed up at the PA MUFON UFO Public Awareness Day in Harrisburg, PA on May 17, 2008 and gave this report. A Dark Triangular Craft was seen in December during the late 90's emitting a beam flying along the Highway moving with the anonymous witness' car at the same relative speed. The car was moving at the rate of 55 mph. The Craft was seen on the Highway while the witness was going from Halifax, PA to Lykens, PA. The Triangular Craft was dark with white lights across the back. After about 1 minute of following the car, the Craft turned on its lights on the underbelly (which appeared to be like search lights that beamed down to the ground) and flew away over the trees that lined the Highway."],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1997 06:45 UTC","Summary":"Dark Triangular Craft emitting a beam flying along the Highway.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10838.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10838.html"],"Longitude":"-76.880448","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Harrisburg","Case Number":"10838","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.28332","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.28332,+-76.880448(10838)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10838) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Log Number":"US-05202008-0013","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Harrisburg","There were no other sightings in Harrisburg on or around November 30th 1997"],"Date of the Event":"11/30/1997 06:45 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
