I caught these pics (1 and 2 of 4 ) while just checking out the cam. I thought it was just a bird flying by but thought it looked a little like a flying saucer so I hit the screen capture button. I was surprised when the webcam refreshed 30 seconds later. Same shape but appearing to be further away. It seems to be going in a straight line. I tryed just now to get on the cam and it appears to be down right now. Google search mentions it many times."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/16/2003 01:43 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"3935","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Maine","Date Submitted":"10/16/2003 01:43 UTC"}
