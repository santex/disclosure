At first I simply dismissed it as a plane since I live close to Dulles airport but after a minute of observing I realized it wasn't. I admit I'm not a very good judge of distance and size but I could tell after watching it was far too big and slow moving to be an aircraft. It had bright white lights in what would be the middle rear of the craft in the direction it was moving. It also had blue lights at each tip. The blue lights are what made me stop and think a second that running lights are red (port) and green (starboard)."]}
