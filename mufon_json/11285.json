There was an object hovering over the trees. I couldn't make out the shape--could only see the lights. There was a white light in the center with pulsing red lights on either side. After turning towards Hanover I could still see it in my rear view mirror and watched until I went over the hill where the high school was. I drove the remaining 3 miles home, told my mom about it and persuaded her to go with me to see if it was still there. It was still in the exact place I had last seen it but as soon as we started to drive in that direction it started to move away from us--almost like it could read our minds and knew we were chasing it. We followed it for a while but we could never get any closer to it so we turned around. when we got back to the top if the hill we could still see it in the moving slowly in the distance."],"Log Number":"US-06232008-0014","Date of the Event":"01/15/1977 07:30 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.06666,+-82.397694(11285)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11285) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Newark","Summary":"Ufo hovering over trees"}
