{"divs":["Sighting DetailsHaving a fire when the disk appeared coming from the north. I first noticed it when I went in to get a drink I saw it behind an airplane moving somewhat eraticly. My reactions where holy mackeral! When I saw it I instatly knew it was not a helicopter or an air plane. But what caught my attention was the fact that it made no noise.
