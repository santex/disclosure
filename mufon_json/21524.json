{"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"21524","divs":["sighting detailsi was at the front yard with my dog when i looked up and saw a red-orange light hovering without any sound. i immediately tried to assess whether it was a plane or a helicopter. we see both of those often around here and i'm sure it wasn't either of them. it was at a high-flying chopper distance. it was at the northeastern direction from george mason university. i immediately called my family to witness this. i said \"i think there's a ufo outside, you have to come and see this\" they came and they saw it too. when my sister went back in to grab a camera, the light started fading out, slowly. it faded out and at last it seemed like a distant star and disappeared. when it was bright, it was about the size of 1\\16th of a full moon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.855274,+-77.299373(21524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21524) map </A>","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Fairfax","There were no other sightings in Fairfax on or around January 16th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21524.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/16/2010 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01162010-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Hovering reddish-orange color light.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Fairfax","Latitude":"38.855274","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval","Date Submitted":"01/16/2010 10:50 UTC","Region":"Virginia","Longitude":"-77.299373","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
