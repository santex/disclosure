Approximately four minutes later, while driving east on Hwy 175 toward Frankston, TX, a silver disc shaped object came out of the trees and flashed across the sky quite close to the roof of my car and within seconds disappeared into the sky. It happened very quickly. There was no sound. It appeared to be \"spinning\" as it moved. I have a gut feeling that it was an alien craft; as I've felt there presence in the area. When I saw the craft, I was startled, yet not afraid. I was unable to see the craft as I was driving and it disappeared quickly."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.074326,+-95.598292(19931)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19931) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Poynor","There were no other sightings in Poynor on or around October 11th 2009"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
