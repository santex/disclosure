{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went to bed in our family farm house outside Hume, IL while on summer vacation from the U. of Notre Dame and saw a bright orange light low in the sky outside my bedroom window. It was moving at a slow rate of speed (almost hovering). It appeared to be only a few hundred yards away. After watching it for a couple of minutes, the glowing orange object then took off at an extraordinary rate of speed and disappeared over the horizon. It was clearly something out of the ordinary and am convinced to this day that it was not of this world. A few years ago a friend loaned me a tape about UFOs and it showed an object that looked like what I saw. The object had been photographed in Ohio I believe at about the same time as my sighting. I never reported this but thought better late than never.
