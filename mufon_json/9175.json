I know it sounds Crazy, and I will not go into how I know this. But between the 1st day of February 2008, and the 12th day of February 2008, the exact time I do not know. Between the coast of California, and the Catalina Islands, a craft not from this world will be available for viewing by anyone diligent enough to investigate. I urge you to have as many cameras at this location as is possible, and any other equipment you will need to varify the legitimacy of the craft. The craft will exit from the ocean, and continue into the sky. I am not a psychic, or an alien expert,or a nut,or a prankster, and if you choose to delete this, I will understand. I urge you to investigate this matter as you see fit. Please do not release my name or identity, as I do not want the attention that something like this will surely cause. Thank you for your time. I am not sure of the county, so please forgive me for using the first one on the list."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01232008-0003","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9175.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9175.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/23/2008 01:11 UTC"}
