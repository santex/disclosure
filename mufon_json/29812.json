{"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were standing in our yard looking East when we spotted a glowing red object coming from the south flying in a Northeastern direction. We watched it fly silently through the sky above Auburn, IN at a slow pace. As it was becoming obstructed from view by my neighbors house I ran around to the other side to watch it. As it flew across the sky I happened to look straight up and I saw a large white object flying from the Northwest to the Southeast as it flew over head we were lucky enough to catch it on video. As it was flying off into the distance it faded away to nothing."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"06/29/2011 10:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29812.html"],"Case Number":"29812","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-85.135527","Log Number":"US-06302011-0021","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Garrett","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Indiana","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.349494,+-85.135527(29812)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29812) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Garrett","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Glowing red triangle.","Latitude":"41.349494","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"06/30/2011 09:09 UTC"}
