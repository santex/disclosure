This particular evening we witnessed plane after plane flying over our home, both low and high altitudes. When we played back the video I saw a bar of light zoom in front of the lens that we did not see when filming. I had a previous sighting in May of a V shaped object which was flat with 6 orange lights underneath and I dont know if this is the same thing but it definitely could be! I tried to rationalize that this could be a reflection of some kind but I have no idea where the light would have come from."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"01:20:00","Date Submitted":"07/28/2012 11:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-96.665033","City":"Seminole","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oklahoma","Latitude":"35.2337","Date of the Event":"07/25/2012 09:25 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"{nd} Was taking video of many stealth planes in area, saw beam of light when video was played back","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41232.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41232_submitter_file1__glowone.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41232_submitter_file2__glow1.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41232_submitter_file3__glow.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41232.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07282012-0038","Case Number":"41232","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Seminole","There were no other sightings in Seminole on or around July 25th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""]}
