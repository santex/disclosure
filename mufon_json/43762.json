M. I WAS OUTSIDE HAVING A CIGARETTE AND LOOKING AT THE STARS WHEN THE SKY LIT UP TO THE EAST OF ME. I LOOKED UP AND I SAW A VERY BRIGHT FLOURESENT GREEN STREAK ABOUT A MILE LONG TRAVELING NORTH GOING SOUTH AFTER CHANGING DIRECTION SLIGHTLY. IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE A METEOR OR SOMETHING ELSE EXCEPT IT WAS MORE TUBULAR SHAPED AND TRAVELING WAY TOO SLOW TO BE A METEOR AND IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND GREEN IT LIT UP THE WHOLE SKY. I LOST SIGHT OF IT WHEN IT DISAPEARED OVER THE TREES. I KNEW THEN THAT WHAT I HAD JUST SEEN WAS A UFO OF A TYPE I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE. I CALLED THE SEATTLE POST INTELLIGENCER A NUMBER OF TIMES, LEFT MESSAGES AND SENT THEM E-MAILS IF THEY HAD ANY INFORMATION ON IT AND I GOT NO REPLIES. I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS SHOOTING STARS AND SOME FALLING SATELLITES IN MY LIFE AND NONE OF THEM LOOKED LIKE THIS. HAVE YOU OR ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE RECIEVED ANY REPORT OR ANYTHING ABOUT THIS EVENT?"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.596704,+-122.682281(43762)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43762) map </A>","Latitude":"47.596704","Sighting Duration":"02:28:00","Date Submitted":"11/07/2012 08:26 UTC","Log Number":"US-11072012-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43762.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43762.html"],"Case Number":"43762","Longitude":"-122.682281","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Bremerton","There were no other sightings in Bremerton on or around September 6th 2012"],"Tags":"City","City":"Bremerton","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Washington","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
