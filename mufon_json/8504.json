As it hovers in the distance it appears to \"dance\" up and down, slowly, then zooms east. I thought it was a planet, then a helicopter, but now i know it isnt, because both of those objects cannot move like that. I was in bed and saw this object out of my window, i noticed it as i was about to go to sleep. It just didnt look right. But then it disappeared and then i went to bed. I will try to take pictures next time."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Stockholm","There were no other sightings in Stockholm on or around November 8th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"11/08/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"object in distance","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Stockholm County","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"SE-11292007-0007","Date Submitted":"11/08/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"8504","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8504.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8504.html"],"Latitude":"59.33558","Longitude":"18.07369","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Stockholm"}
