The helicopter did a complete circle around my house with my house in the center. I couldn't help but feel an eerie feeling like I had a gun pointing at me. I noticed it was shorter in length than a Black hawk with similar windows on the side like the black hawk but all 4-5 were equal in size. I wanted to take my cell phone out of my pocket to shoot video but an eerie feeling telling me not to came over me."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"All black helicopter with no markings, lettering or insignia","City":"Fire Island","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50064.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50064.html"],"Region":"New York","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"50064","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fire Island","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.738546,+-72.847305(50064)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50064) map </A>","Longitude":"-72.847305","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"08/20/2013 08:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/22/2013 06:05 UTC","Country":"United States"}
