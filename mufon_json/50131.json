{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were walking our dogs when I noticed at least a dozen lights in the sky low to the NE. These lights were star like. Red in color and pulsed. Being a retired air traffic controller I am familiar with aircraft lights at night. These were all only red in color and pulsed at random, not like aircraft lights. The objects appeared to track SW gaining altitude and at about 30 degrees above the horizon they turned North and disappeared. We observed up to a dozen lights at a time in a staggered line and as the leading lights faded away new lights were appearing from behind the trees. The whole event lasted approx 90 sec and we saw at least 18 separate lights. Due to my back ground I did not feel that these were aircraft, especially since there were so many in close proximity to each other, and how they just vanished like they went into a cloud, except it was a clear night with no clouds in the sky."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.422087,+-83.463451(50131)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50131) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"50131","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50131.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50131.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 10:46 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-83.463451","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Country":"United States","City":"Northville","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-08242013-0028","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Northville","There were no other sightings in Northville on or around August 24th 2013"],"Summary":"Observed I dr a dozen red lights in a line that gained altitude, turned to the north and disappeared..","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"42.422087","Date Submitted":"08/24/2013 11:42 UTC","Object Features":"None"}
