Sunlight was not yet coming up from the east so it was nice and dark out. Movement caught my eye directly above my house and I focused in on it. Moving in almost a straight line from east to west was oval shaped object. It was not a distant object, maybe just above high cloud cover. There were light on the opposite edges of the peaks of the oval shape. At first I thought it was just bright coloring on the edges but when it moved over some slight cloud cover west of my house I could see the edges slightly glowing through the clouds. Object was moving extrememly fast. It moved from directly above my house to the west horizon and out of view within 4-5 seconds."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Kansas City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Large oval craft flew over town at 5:45 AM","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 05:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19623.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19623.html"],"Latitude":"39.107446","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-09242009-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.107446,+-94.571577(19623)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19623) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"19623","Date Submitted":"09/24/2009 06:46 UTC","Longitude":"-94.571577","Region":"Missouri","Country":"United States"}
