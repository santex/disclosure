So I went outside and took some random photographs of the sky to see if any of the pictures would come out. I Observed nothing, I saw no ufo, or lights, until I got the pictures on my computer and in about a dozen or so photos I caught a snake like ufo, that seemed to change shape and color some. The pictures are all from different angles but clearly show the craft shape and colors. A few stars made it in the picture, which makes a great marker for the ufo object. I went out again about 2 hours later and took more photographs, and sure enough when I got inside I have a bunch more images of the object. I have the original images on my camera still, I also have all the original pictures on 2 computers. I have over a dozen images of this object. I am only releasing one photo of the object at this time."],"Log Number":"US-12252011-0025","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Parrish","There were no other sightings in Parrish on or around December 25th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.515015","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Parrish","Date Submitted":"12/25/2011 10:32 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"After taking pictures of the stars, I found a ufo in the photos when I got them on my computer","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.515015,+-82.453705(34304)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34304) map </A>","Longitude":"-82.453705","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"12/25/2011 02:30 UTC"}
