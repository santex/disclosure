My friend who wants to remain anonymous caught this footage on his vhs recorder. My friends son was outside in the backyard of thier house and looked up because he saw something strange. My friends son yelled for his dad to come out and see the unknown object in the sky. My friend saw the unknown object and grabbed his vhs recorder and began recording the unknown object which appeared to be in mid air. The unknown object had lights and appeared to be spinning with other parts spinning at different times. At one time in the footage you can see and hear a plane fly by the unknown object.
