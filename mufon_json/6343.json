I had to go ahead and make my left turn, so i lost sight of it as i turned north. it was at this point that it hit me how odd this was, i had never seen anything even close to this. at he next block i turned around to go back and see if was still visible. this took probably little over a minute. but when i got back there was nothing to see. I then remembered video i had seen on tv of sightings in mexico i think of shiny spherical objects, and what i saw was identical to those videos. later in the day when i thought about it, i felt that it was strange that i did not get excited or afraid when i was seeing this. it was like i had suspended judgement and was merely an observer. as i left the scene of the sighting, i went about my business running some errands and then went to work. i didnt even think about it for a while, until i was at work and i told some people about it. they were all skeptical. i cannot say what it was i saw, but it was so distinct of an object, not fuzzy, or in the sun, or obscurred in any way. it was as plain as day."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6343.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6343.html"],"Country":"United States","City":"Norman","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-02082007-0003","Date of the Event":"02/07/2007 12:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.227377","Summary":"spherical shape about two or three feet diameter moving slowly from north to south","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
