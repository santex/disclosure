I'm from West Virginia. I'm 19 years old and last night I witnessed a ufo at 9:30 pm. Me and my girlfriends dad were on our way to take me home on a country or suburban road we were in his dodge truck and on the way to my house He looked over and saw this object and pointed it out to me and in this open grass field there was a giant red ball it was fire engine red it was not anything I've seen in my life before When I first saw it I didn't know what it was I was just glued to it looking for detail and trying to figure out what it was and my girlfriends dad is a really smart and it takes alot for him to believe something and when he saw it he slammed on the breaks and stopped in the middle of the road when we were looking at it it was really low solid round fire engine red ball it was very big it was about a football field away from us above this grass field that is huge could possibly have cows in it it had a white glow around it now it was not a plane not any kind of plane at that not the sun or moon it was hovering above the ground about the height of the top of a water tower and it had nothing to do with a water tower cause I just done my research and there is nothing there well when we were observing it a car came so we had to move well we knew it was something out of the ordinary so we went 10 seconds down the road to turn around and came back and it was gone I think other people witnessed it I tried to get pictures or a possible video but my phone died it had battery life too which doesn't explain anything to me I know what I saw I wish you guys would write me back and let me know you got this and your thoughts about it I have more details and stuff and my girlfiends dad will tell you the story too I think I have something worth your time so please let me know something Thank You"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Martinsburg","Region":"West Virginia","Case Number":"9962"}
