My wife and Iwere out in a field late at night near the campground looking at the stars.There were very few clouds and it was generally a clear, cold night and good forstargazing. We were looking up toward a mountain we planned on climbing the nextday when we saw a light come over the mountain, and it was moving very slowly,like a helicopter, but it wasnt making any noise, which was odd since it was nomore than five miles away at my best guess. I know helicopters make noise atthat distance in such clear, quiet conditions, but this thing didnt. We watchedit for a few minutes as it slowly crossed the valley. It had crossed themountain at just above treetop level it seemed and kept the same altitude overthe valley, so it was at least 3,000 feet above the valley floor, as that is theelevation gain to the top of the mountain. When it got almost across the valleyit suddenly accelerated out of sight in a flash. It went from about 10 mph to aflash of light and it was gone in a streak. It never made any noise, even whenaccelerating away."],"Date Submitted":"01/08/2004 10:48 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-83.755728","Summary":"Saw light behaving not like an aircraft","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.675366,+-83.755728(2782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2782) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Undisclosed"}
