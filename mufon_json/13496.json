She snapped photo of some family members. It was not until she returned back to Nebraska that we looked at the picture on Nov.1,2008 and we noticed an object above the heads of the family members. We zoomed in on the object and could not identify it as a known object. She does not remember seeing any objects in the sky during the actual time of the photo. That is about all. We are just looking for someone to put the picture through some software to de-pixalate and let us know what they find out."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.577679","Country":"United States","Latitude":"47.331164"}
