i did not loose interest though and retold the story frome time to time over the years. strang thing though...i met even more people with the same or similar \"objects\" in the same or different locations. speculations abounded. through the conversations i started figuring that 6these were placed on acapuncture meridians. i've had treatments and studied on it a bit. then it evolved in my mind that this object undiferentiated the local tissue and formed a ganglia about itself, hence the extreme pain when probed or messed with. just a theory. when i tried to write this story once i stored it to a floppy, the next morning the disc was blanked. i made several more such failed attempts. then, as i am an experienced professional photographer i decided to try an experiment, i shoved it ind an x-ray packet used for safekeeping film through airport machines. that worked and the copy was \"safe\". it's still around here somewhere. but the story continues.... four years ago i discovered a new bump on the inside of my left wrist. no memories on how i could have received such an injury to the even more sensitive area of the wrist. it was the same though in all ways to the previus \"tag\". i want it gone! but there is even more to this story. on april the twenty second of two thousand and nine, ten - twenty p.m. i witnessed an usual object pass directly over my house. it was at about twelve hundred feet because it was under a lite scattering of small puffy clouds that still allowed viewing the stars and constelations. as it approached over the local small town of junction city oregon it appeared to be strange. the city lights weren't quite able fo catch a real reflection off it. as it left the lights it became totaly black. as it approached i shook my head as looking away as i asked myself if it was real. i am a lifetime member of the astronomical society and know the sky. it blocked the clouds and stars. so it revealed to me it's oultine, a huge triangle slightly indented at its apparent rear end. so i held up my hands and bracketed it, it was big enough that if i tried to hold a basketball that i couldn't have...maybe a larger ball though. as it passed over i heard nothing, observed no change in its slow pace or course. stranger still...the bump on my wrist seemed to tingle. the object left due west and the entire viewing was approximately two minutes. later as i tried to estimate conventional jets that passed over i guestimated the triangle must have been about five hundred feet wide by three hundred feet long. but back to the \"tag\" in my wrist. last year i was working on a sheetrock project with a bro and scraped it very roughly. it scabed over and as it healed, it left an outline similar to the calous on my ankle. but it is still there and still visible. i would so like someone to take a serious look at it. when going into a surgery through the v.a. last year the radiologist who was sweeping me for any potentialy dangerous metals in my body could find nothing. maybe it is silicon based. what do you think? i invite contact and further discussion."],"Summary":"This is more about a tag on my left wrist","Region":"Oregon","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.061639,+-123.083824(28468)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28468) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28468.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28468.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Eugene","Case Number":"28468","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/27/2011 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There were no other sightings in Eugene on or around March 27th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.061639","Longitude":"-123.083824","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
