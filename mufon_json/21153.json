The view of the mountains by the kitchen window was magnificent. The snow was covering the top of the mountains that I see and love everyday. I took my camera outside my backyard and took some pictures, before the snow started melting. When I started seeing the pictures I took, I notice a sharp glowing object with it's shadow underneath my feelings were that only a camera captures anything out of the ordinary that we humans are not capable of seeing. To me the shade under the light was a flying object and the light that the camera captures was some kind of radiation from the flying object."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/26/2009 04:51 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/07/2009 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.837906","Case Number":"21153","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Palm Springs","There were no other sightings in Palm Springs on or around December 7th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Bright Light with a shadow under","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
