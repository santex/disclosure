We were driving south on 86th Street in Des Moines, Iowa. At that time there used to be a large fenced-in power sub-station on the southeast corner of the intersection of 86th and University. As we approached that intersection we noticed a lot of lights in the air over the substation and stopped the car to look at it. We saw a rectangular-shaped object with rounded corners, about the size and shape of a football field and about 150 feet in the air. It wasn���t thick, and appeared to be a flat object horizontal to the ground. There heard no sound, but we had our windows rolled up. We were probably not over 300 feet away from the closest part of the object. It was hovering over the substation and had numerous bright white lights around the edges. We did not count them. We were completely taken by surprise, and it was a very scary situation, and I had the definite impression that someone was watching us. (I have wondered about missing time, but I���m pretty sure there was none, since we were on our way to a party.) I do not remember any other traffic in the area. We noticed no electrical interference, but the car was turned off. After approximately one minute it took off toward the northwest, faster than a jet, and gained altitude as it left. We never told this to anyone, even our closest friends, for a number of years."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"13744","Longitude":"-93.605756","Date of the Event":"11/30/1971 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"41.604045","City":"Des Moines","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Des Moines","There were no other sightings in Des Moines on or around November 30th 1971"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.604045,+-93.605756(13744)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13744) map </A>","Tags":"City"}
