I���ve talked with the mother on several occasions and found her to be coherent, intelligent, and very clear about the facts after repeated questioning. The event took place on a clear, cold spring morning in 1984 or ���85. They had gotten up early at the request of the son to watch the space shuttle fly by. The 80-year home is located in Westborough Mass. The house was a 2- story with 3 rooms on each floor. A triangular craft about the same diameter as the house was seen passing about 2 car lengths above her house. Her son is positive that the craft had 7 lights in a V formation with one at the top and 3 on each side forming the V formation. She said that the lights were red in color and about the size of a baseball and they didn���t blink. It continued to move very slowly across the top of her house. At one point she felt that the craft stopped for several minutes above her home to observe them, then moved on. The craft took between 10-15 minutes to pass over and it passed so slowly that it was boring for the mother to watch. Shirley didn���t experienced any missing time although she would consider under going hypnosis to see if there are any lost memories. She said the streetlight was on, possibly blocking out the edges of the craft and she felt this is why she only saw the lights. Shirley also felt had the craft been higher up it would have been very difficult to see. She did think of taking pictures but her son who realized the craft was not the space shuttle became very afraid of it and because of his fright she wasn���t able to leave him alone to get her camera. However the son described the craft as being black against a black sky. He could see it had a definite form and edges to it because it blocked out the stars."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown"}
