I sent the third pic to show it was not a spec on the lens. all pics taken within three mins.the first pic shows the object far off and banking in a turn maybe? the second one it appears to have a defined shape,a round base with some sort of mast or tower. we were on Stewerts mtn west of Moscow where there is a wind servay tower in background of photo three. there is approx 50 wind turbines going up in the area,maybe they are interested? pic two was taken ony about 45 secs after pic one,I steped up onto the bank near the strange tree (photo 3) to get better shot of the lake.(flagstaff)so anyways check them out see what you think.thank you for looking."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25951_submitter_file1__ufo1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25951_submitter_file2__ufo2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25951_submitter_file3__ufo3.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25951.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.768832,+-69.713278(25951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25951) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Skowhegan","There were no other sightings in Skowhegan on or around July 6th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","City":"Skowhegan","Summary":"was found on photo after it was taken","Date Submitted":"10/18/2010 10:13 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10182010-0005","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-69.713278","Date of the Event":"07/06/2009 07:18 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
