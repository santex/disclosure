At first I thought it was an airplane. I stopped and watched it, saw no glowing lights and realized it was not moving but rather, hovering over the field. This continued for approximately 15 minutes before the orb shot straight up in the air and disappeared. The object left no vapor trail and moved faster than any aircraft I have witnessed."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.76805,+-87.221121(8386)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8386) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"11/16/2007 08:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8386.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8386.html"],"Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Rockville","There were no other sightings in Rockville on or around November 16th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.76805","Country":"United States","City":"Rockville","Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"8386","Log Number":"US-11172007-0006","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Summary":"Glowing Orange Sphere Hovered over Field"}
