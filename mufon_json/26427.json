{"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsmy name is *wit's name deleted--cms\\sg, i live in clearwater overlooking the bayside bridge. i got your name off of one of the ufo shows on the history channel. i wanted to report a siting and see if there were any more like it around the same time. in early september i was watching the tele at home around 9pm. i had just put my daughter to sleep and the house was pretty quiet. i heard and felt this weird rumble, it was very gentle and faint but i could just sense something. without giving it much thought i went outside and as soon as i opened my door these bright lights in the distant sky caught my attention. it was hovering over the bridge; at first i assumed it was a plane since we are close to the air port but this thing was literately hovering, it did not move at all. i stared at it for a while, trying to take in everything i was seeing, at the same time looking for any neighbors that were outside to have them verify what i was seeing. there were 3 lights all along side each other but evenly spaced out. in between them, but a little lower, were 4 red lights that were blinking at a slow rate. i watched for a bout 10 minutes before it moved, it moved quickly to the right (my right) then back to the left. at this point i went inside to get my camera but it was too dark out and the image was not clear. as i continued to watch this light, about the size of a distance star from my view, came flying up towards this ufo from the lower right (my right) corner. it flew towards the ufo and when it got really close it disappeared and within 2 mins the entire thing vanished. it didn't fly away, it vanished out of site within an instant! i thought i was crazy for a while, but five minutes later i hear the sound of two choppers, they weren't coast guard choppers i don't believe, i think it was unmarked and a dark color. one flew over to where i saw the ufo , over the bay, then it left and the other helicopter flew around the surrounding area 4 times before flying away. in a way i felt like that confirmed what i saw was indeed a ufo. i went inside and hopped online afterwards only to find that there were a number of ufo sitings with in the clearwater\\tampa bay area this past summer. i was wondering if anyone else has contacted you with this same story"],"Longitude":"-82.797633","City":"Clearwater","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/01/2010 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"3 Lights with 4 Red Lights Beneath","Date Submitted":"11/08/2010 06:39 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.970703,+-82.797633(26427)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26427) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.970703","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26427.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26427.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11082010-0007","Case Number":"26427","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Clearwater","There were no other sightings in Clearwater on or around September 1st 2010"]}
