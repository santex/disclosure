As we were approaching a main street Garden Grove Blvd. I saw a larged illuminated object with a large dome on it that was greatly reflecting the sun. I could hardly make out its oval shape, but could tell it was a cream color. It was about 50 feet long, and 30 feet wide. It traveled westward at 3 to 4 mph towards a black high rise office building. It went behind the middle of the building, and did not come out from the other side. Four seconds later my friend Frank who is a retired police officer said he saw the object, as a dot a mile and a half to two miles away. Only he referred to it as being aircraft, I guess, because he was a police officer. A couple of days later he said it was a UFO. My other friend Andy was in the back seat, and did not see it. When I first saw the object I did not know what to make of it. The driver said to my friend in the back seat, \"Andy what do you make of that?\" But Andy was afraid to look. Although I have had 11 close encounter sightings, mostly a within a quarter mile from where I live, I could not believe what I was seeing. It was about 130 yards away, and most of the time we were stopped at a light. Over the years some people have told me that they have seen strage objects over or near Garden Grove Blvd. Thank you.
