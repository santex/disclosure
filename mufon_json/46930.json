But many nights I observed this (whatever) that seemed like a planet but was always in the same place. Directly above the city. I would guess it was in space. I observed it as a disk so not a star.","Date Submitted":"04/23/2013 12:23 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsFor at least 6 months I had seen what I thought was a planet but the only one it could be was saturn. saturn was too far away to be a disk, especially with the naked eye. And I absolutely always saw it in the same place, directly up. All other space objects move except the North star and it was not a star as it was clearly a disk. It could be a sattelite in geosynchronous orbit but to be that large it had to be immense in size, as geo-sattelites orbit at 23,000 miles up. I cannot guess what it could be, as I say, it is always in exactly the same place. So I would label it as unidentified. I would apprciate e-mails from anyone else who has seen it."],"Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"03:00:00","City":"Chicago","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46930.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46930.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.896616,+-87.622498(46930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46930) map </A>","Region":"Illinois","Latitude":"41.896616","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around January 15th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"01/15/2013 09:01 UTC"}
