My Husband put the dogs out at 10.45 PM last port of call for the dogs before bed, Husband walked round the back garden with them when he caught site of this huge white glowing light coming over the bungalow about as high as a Private plane, it was traveling at a steady speed no noise whatsoever coming from it, it looked like a massive Planet except it was moving, My Husband came quickly in doors and rushed into the conservatory to get his binoculars and shouted to me come and have a look at this ,well I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like it, it was so bright it was heading for the southeast ,as it moved further behind the trees out the front way where the big oak tree stands just outside the drive way , I went into the lounge to have a look out of that window and it was heading for the sea veering off to the south. I emailed the local air base in Norfolk to let them know what we had seen and hopefully we might get a reply. It was not a plane as it had no navigation lights just a very intense white glow we would have heard an engine if it had one, you can hear a pin drop out here at night as it���s so quiet. We just thought this is a UFO, we were quite taken back by this, it actually made us feel very uneasy, it never made any noise, and was so bright that we couldn���t see any shape only that it look like a ball of light about the size of a tea plate, my husband has worked for the oil companies for 45 years onshore and offshore in construction work and is very well thought of in his job and is now an inspector. He would have known if this UFO object was anything manmade that we know of that fly in our sky���s;"],"Log Number":"GB-07012013-0008","Object Features":"None","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Blundeston","There were no other sightings in Blundeston on or around June 13th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"06/13/2013 11:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/01/2013 11:31 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
