They were alltalking about stuff while I was leaning back in my chair looking for shootingstars. Out of the corner of my eye, in the south sky, I seen a slow movinglight at first I thought it was a shooting star but realized it was a littlebigger and changed from red to orange to white in a matter of seconds. Itlooked as though it was enflamed, it shot out something that from our distancelooked like a spark at the same time one of my friends shouted obscenities indisbelief. We seen it go under a cloud as it shot sparks two more times eachabout a half second apart. Then it abruptly slowed down and sped up to where itsuddenly disappeared. The object left a small flaming tail but was too low inmy opinion to be space junk. It was an almost perfect triangle with roundededges. It was heading between south and southeast and only lasted a fewseconds.
