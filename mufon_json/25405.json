{"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside smoking a cigarette and looking at the stars and clouds when I saw a bright light that I thought was the north star at first but then it was moving. It was moving pretty quickly from west to east, thought it was an airplane at first but then I did see an airplane and realized it did not look the same. It had no flashing lights, just one solid bright white light. It moved faster than a plane at that height and made no sound. It moved from west to east then suddenly turned south and then turned again and dissappeared out of sight, not behind a cloud or anything, just slowly faded. I just don't think it was an airplane because there were no flashing lights and it turned way too sharply too fast, like a 90degree turn very quickly for that altitude. Wondering if anyone else saw this?"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25405.html"],"Region":"Indiana","Longitude":"-86.149154","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.777176,+-86.149154(25405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25405) map </A>","City":"Indianapolis","Log Number":"US-09132010-0005","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.777176","Case Number":"25405","Date Submitted":"09/13/2010 09:04 UTC","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There was one other sighting in Indianapolis on or around September 13th 2010"],"Summary":"Airplane like but not an airplane.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/13/2010 08:45 UTC","Tags":"City"}
