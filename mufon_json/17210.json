{"Latitude":"34.172057","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife, daughter, my daughter's boyfriend and myself were sitting in our backyard at 19:30 on may 27, 2009 when i noticed what looked like a black baloon at about 30 degrees in the northern sky. i stood up and focused on the object and asked my daughter to run inside and get my binoculars. i wanted to confirm that the object was just a balloon. a few minutes later when i looked at the object thru the binoculars i could tell that this wasn't a balloon. the object appeared to have a body and wings, but not like any aircraft i've ever seen. the edges of the object were fuzzy and appeared to be changing shape. even when viewed through the binoculars, the object appeared small, and therefor, was very high up in the sky. i asked my wife to get my digital camera, a cannon 7.1 mega pixel power shot. i handed the binoculars to my daughter and quickly framed the object and started snapping photos. i used two settings, auto and landscape, and zoomed to the max 4x on the landscape setting. while i continued to snap pictures, my daughter kept an eye on the object through the binoculars. she described what she was seeing as an object that was constantly changing shape and color. the sun was low in the western sky, and the typical sunset \\ smog effect in the la area was causing the object to change colors from black to orange-red to silver. within a few minutes, three other object appeared in the same area of the sky. the objects appeared to be slowly rising higher and moving towards the north, away from us. the wind on the ground was maybe 5 mph blowing towards the south. there were a few cirrostratus clouds and the objects appeared to be at about the same height. our best guess was that the objects were at 20,000 to 30,000 feet. our best guess was that the objects were about 15 miles to the north of us over the oak mountains, just to the east of rocketdyne which is located on the simi hills. the objects appeared to be hovering in place for about twenty minutes with only minor movement. based on the photos and the observations through the binoculars, we all thought the objects were rising and moving slowly to the north. at 19:50 the objects just disappeared from our view. we continued to watch for another 15 minutes, but didn't see anything else. on a normal evening, we see commercial aircraft approaching the burbank airport. the commercial aircraft are usually flying at 3,000 feet as they pass our vantage point, moving west to east. i'm attaching three of the thirty photos i took to this report. the first photo shows one dark object in the center of the frame and a commercial plane in the lower left. the second shows three unidentified objects in the same frame. the third shows two objects and a powerline in the foreground. we are all certain that this was not a standard aircraft, neither private, military nor commercial. this was not a balloon, star or planet. there was no sound coming from the objects. we had no sense that the objects were attached to each other or flying in a formation. because of the height, it is impossible to say how large the objects were, but our best guess would be that they were larger than any standard commercial aircraft. their movement, or lack of movement, indicates again that this was not a standard aircraft."],"Longitude":"-118.603425","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17210.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17210_submitter_file1__UFO.1.05.27.2009.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17210_submitter_file2__UFO.2.05.27.2009.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17210_submitter_file3__UFO.3.05.27.2009.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17210.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"05/27/2009 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.172057,+-118.603425(17210)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17210) map </A>","City":"Los Angeles","Case Number":"17210","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around May 27th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05282009-0013","Date of the Event":"05/27/2009 07:30 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Four unidentified chevron shaped objects were observed for twenty minutes over the mountains just to the north of the west side of the San Fernando Valley."}
