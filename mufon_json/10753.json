I wasn`t taking any notice of what was happening in the sky. On my return to England I transfered my photos onto my computer and printed the one of the River Arno. I was surprised to see that it included a clearly observable `thing` in the sky. I enlarged the photo and it appears to be a picture of a UFO. All who have seen it says it cannot be a picture of a balloon, a helicopter or a fixed winged aircraft. Attatched are three photos, the first is the one on my camera, the other two are enlargements of this. I hope this may be of some interest to you - perhaps I am just wasting your time!"],"Country":"Italy","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/04/2008 10:59 UTC","Case Number":"10753","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.768732,+11.256901(10753)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10753) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Florence","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Date of the Event":"04/04/2008 10:59 UTC"}
