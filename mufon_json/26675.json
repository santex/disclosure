He pointed out a object in the sky and was kidding around and said it was a UFO. I told him he was crazy and looked at the sky to see what he was talking about. I then told him that it really did look like a ufo because it did not resemble a airplane or anything else I had ever seen before. I looked down beside me to get my phone and call and tell my mother and when I looked back up to see it again it was gone. Me and my husband looked everywhere in the sky for it and we were unable to locate it. Where we saw the ufo was only a few miles from our house when we got home we looked again and we were still unable to see where it was or to possible make out if it was a plane that we had mistaken for a ufo."]}
