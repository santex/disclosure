{"Region":"New York","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing on my balcony looking up at the sky straight up above my head I saw a star formation Alphekka, and then it looked like a star broke free. I first thought it was just a blur, or a plane, but then it flew in a pattern unfamiliar to planes, it was erratic in nature, it paused, and then continue to move north through Hercules, toward Vega and disappeared. It didn't gain intensity, it stayed a faint brightness, but remained visible for almost 2 minutes, and then it disappeared. I felt like this was my first actual sighting, that I wanted to share with a community. After it took me an hour to gather my thoughts, and decide that I had to tell someone about it. I went back out to look and I didn't see anything like what I saw before."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.815376,+-73.045108(29336)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29336) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.815376","Summary":"Small star-like object moving at a moderate rate of speed high in the sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29336.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29336.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/31/2011 10:44 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/31/2011 11:21 UTC","City":"Holtsville","Longitude":"-73.045108","Case Number":"29336","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Holtsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Log Number":"US-05312011-0015"}
