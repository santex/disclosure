We were not under the influence of alcohol or any other substances. My friend pointed it out to me and we slowed and watched it for a minute or two. At first I thought it was a star or planet, but it moved. Then considered if it was a plane, but it had no blinking lights. Considered it being a satellite, but, although moving up from the horizon slowly, it noticeably made stops then continued moving. In the end, the light faded out over the course of two seconds uniformly until it could not be seen."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 07:00 UTC","City":"Orleans","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09052012-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.252593,+-78.2308(42320)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42320) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Orleans","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"New York","Date Submitted":"09/05/2012 06:05 UTC","Latitude":"43.252593","Case Number":"42320"}
