It was moving very slowly just below the clouds and sometimes would go into the clouds, then come out again in and up and down and straight pattern, then it moved backward slightly and I realized it was not a plane. I saw no wings or tail, but it looked like a cigar shaped silver thing. Very large, like the size of two or three 747's. All of a sudden, after it moved backwards, it shot forward very very fast, then 90 degrees to the right, and 90 degrees forward again and dissapeared. I'd say it was going many times faster than a jet fighter. I've never seen anything like it. Other people must have seen it, too. Now I'm a believer in UFOs."],"Latitude":"39.255734"}
