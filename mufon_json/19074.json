An aprroximate guess would be that the UFO was 8 miles out and 6-10 thousand feet altitude when it apeared. It then started slowly going west then very quickly it went from 8 miles away from us to 35-50 miles away in about 3 seconds flat,and then was gone, faster than anything commercial or military. Like think about mach 3,4 jets are fast,this object was going mach 12-15 at minimum. It headed toward Linden Michigan. Linden has an airport and Flint Bishop Intl (FNT) is 12 miles north of us,linden airport is 3 miles south west of us, so with that being said theres a good chace radar at these two airports picked this UFO up on radar at 10:04 this evening."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Other"}
