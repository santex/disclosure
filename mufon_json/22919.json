I stop just a few feet before I turned into my dry way and my daughter and I stuck our heads out of the window and this thing was hoovering above us not making a sound but just a (I can't not explain the sound ) but just like a very low hoovering sound above us I could hardly hear it, and all of the suddenly I got this alarming frightening feeling and as I looked out of the window I saw this thing hoovering above my car not quite 30 feet above my car, so I yelled at my daughter to go and get her father, as she runned tours the house I was still looking at this thing hoovering over my car and I got so frightened that I got out of the car and stared running tours my house and then I realize my baby was still in the car so I runned back it must have taken a couple of minutes before I got back to the car I took my baby out of the car and looked up, and all of the sudden this thing it just turn around in mid air without making a sound and flew away it was gone in a matter of seconds if not less. a few years after that, when my youngest daughter learn how to speak and then write all she used to talk about and write about is how she was in a different planet and how she used to tell these people she wanted to go home and be with her family I keep some of the papers she wrote back then"],"Date Submitted":"04/21/2010 01:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Dome","Case Number":"22919","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.32643,+-72.631441(22919)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22919) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22919.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22919.html"],"City":"Northampton","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/15/1989 07:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"Massachusetts","Summary":"the objet was hoovering above us for about 30 seconds","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Northampton","There were no other sightings in Northampton on or around October 15th 1989"],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:01:38","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Latitude":"42.32643","Longitude":"-72.631441","Source":"MUFON"}
