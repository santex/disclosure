I have a very good view of the sky in front of my home. I woke up at 3:50am. I had been awake for around 10 to 15 minutes. I'm laying there (facing north) and in the corner of my right eye here comes this ufo ship, maybe the size of a 757, I'm just not sure. It looked like two huge white wings, lit up like a low wattage white fluorescent bulb. I sat up on my knees on the couch looking at it. It was wierd, I knew immediately what it was and didn't have a bad feeling about it. I was just shocked. It was right above my head. I didn't feel like they were Reptilians or Greys, but I don't know. It was traveling slow and extremely low and there was no sound at all. It traveled above the street, maybe around 20 to 40 feet high and appeared to be heading over neighbors roofs traveling northwest. I was so excited I ran outside of mobile home and ran to the back, but didn't see anything. I went back inside home and woke my mom up and told her what happened. She said, draw a picture of it and write the time down. So I turned on lights and drew some pictures and wrote the time down. Well now it's 4:45am. and I'm laying there on the couch again and about 5 minutes later at 4:50am. I see a white orb traveling a lot higher up in the sky at a further distance. It was traveling west to east. I saw the orb travel for about 8 to 9 seconds. I couldn't believe all the activity that was going on. I turned the lights on and woke my mom up again and told her, then wrote the time and what I saw down on paper."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.877914,+-117.558938(12635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12635) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09192008-0001","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Louvres, Wings","Country":"United States","Summary":"Laying on couch, ship travels slowly by and very low, no sound for about 12 seconds.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12635.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12635.html"],"Case Number":"12635","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"09/17/2008 04:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"09/17/2008 04:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet"}
