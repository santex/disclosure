After we had been together for several weeks and knew I wouldn't laugh, she showed me her UFO photo taken in 2006. While photographing a grass fire East of Coalinga CA, she set her camera to auto fire at one frame per second. In ONE frame, a disc shaped object with a dark circular dot on the underside appears. It does not show in timestamped frames one second before or after. This was not noticed until the pictures were viewed later. Under magnification, the object appears to eclipse a power line behind it! A CalFire official was intrigued enough upon hearing about this photo, he asked for a copy. I should note that no aircraft were dispatched on this fire and no other aircraft were observed in the area,"],"City":"Coalinga","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Coalinga","There were no other sightings in Coalinga on or around October 25th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32712.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32712_submitter_file1__CoalingaUFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32712.html"],"Summary":"Disc object inadvertently captured while photographing a grass fire.","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-120.35819","Object Features":"None","Region":"California","Latitude":"36.147468"}
