{"Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Two bright lights between me and a mountain range that were moving then changed to four dim red lights each, then faded away.","Log Number":"US-12112008-0012","Date Submitted":"12/11/2008 02:20 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI glanced out the window and noticed star-like light that was too low to be a star, as there is a mountain range there. I went outside to watch it to try to figure out what it was. After watching it for about one minute, I noticed it was moving very slowly in an upward direction. After about another minute had passed, there were two of these star-like lights. They were both moving in an arc pattern, back and forth, like a set of parenthesis. So I stared at the objects, waiting to see if they would come closer. They did not, instead after about three minutes of moving slowly back and forth, the one on the north side changed to four dimmer red lights that slowly faded away. The remaining light seemed to stay in the same place for about another minute, before turning to four red lights and fading away. Being a pilot, I know this was like no aircraft I have ever seen."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.75381,+-111.036887(14369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14369) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Region":"Wyoming","Date of the Event":"12/11/2008 02:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-111.036887","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Alta","Case Number":"14369","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14369.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14369.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Alta","There were no other sightings in Alta on or around December 11th 2008"],"Latitude":"43.75381"}
