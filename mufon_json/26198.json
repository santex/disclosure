I ran inside my apartment and got my camera, to get a better view I went upstairs on the balcony and took this video. I zoomed in my camera and then began filming because my camera cannot be zoomed while filming. I didn't think I had gotten anything, since it was so dark and was pointed at the night sky. It wasn't until I was downloading some other images off my camera, I seen the file and then took a look at it on my big screen monitor.. WOW.... The triangular lights I had captured with my digital camera was unexplainable to me, so maybe you can tell me what this is!!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10292010-0018"}
