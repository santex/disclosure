(I work outdoors in a refinery). A passenger jet caught my eye. And out of boredom I watched the condensation trail behind it for about 1 min. While watching, a small silver oval about the same size and altitude as the plane came into my line of sight right next to the passenger jet moving the exact opposite direction. And slightly quicker than the jet. I watched it move in a straight line for about one minute befire it went behing a large cloud. Immediatley after a military style jet came zooming into sight in a big circle pattern right past the passenger jet and in the direction of the ufo. It also dissapeared behind the cloud and that was it. No sound and no trail. Cameraan phones arent allowes in refinery so no pictures."],"Object Features":"None"}
