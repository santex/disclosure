(2 comments - 1 - this form is way too cumbersome. get someone in your group who has familiarity with designing ui or hi to make the form much more user friendly and you'll probably get a lot more reporting. 2 - allow a default form set to be defined for anonymous posters. some ppl will be glad to report such phenomena provided they can automatically do so with ease and without fear of public ridicule. when we saw the first occurrence last year, i looked up \"where to post ufo sightings\" and found your site. however, one look at your form and i opted not to.) the only reason i am taking the time to make this report now, is these \"spheres\" or \"orbs\" myself and a number of my neighbors are seeing in the waukesha wisconsin area are strikingly familiar to those currently being seen\\looked into near lake erie. i'm sure there are a number of ppl in the area who could substantiate similar sightings (i've talked to at least 20 dif ppl who have seen these things), but they'd probably only do so if they were assured their names would be omitted and they'd not be \"on camera\" in any way. though i remain largely skeptical on the topic of ufo's as a whole, these are definitely odd occurrences and they are reoccurring. though to be honest, i don't have the time to be camped out looking at the night sky all the time, so how often or if there's any pattern to their appearances i couldn't tell you. i know they seem to be showing up a great deal the past week or so."],"Region":"Wisconsin","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"22304","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22304.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22304.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03152010-0007","Date Submitted":"03/15/2010 03:50 UTC","City":"Waukesha"}
