At first i thought it was a satellite but it was brighter then all the other stars in the sky and brighter than any other satellite Ive seen in the night sky. I rush inside and turn the porch light off to get a better view(i was inside for less then 5 seconds) when i notice the object had changed direction. The object was coming from my left going to the right and when I came back out it was going away from me. The was doing a very slight zig-zag motion when it was moving away from me, then the object disappeared. I observed the object for about 1 minute."],"Longitude":"-77.606452","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Bright object, brighter then any satellite I have ever seen and brighter then any star in sky.","Latitude":"43.16478","Source":"MUFON"}
