A very loud noise woke me from outside, like a rumbling or a huge engine. My mother said it sounded like a squadron of planes. When I looked up at the sky from my window, I saw very close by, hovering over the trees, a fairly large boxy thing with glowing orange orbs encircling the part that stuck up in the middle of it. It's angular outline reminded me of an old taxi but much sharper and more angular. No light or beam emitted from the orbs but they glowed brightly. This object came sharply forward towards us then suddenly was going another direction. The noise cut off as though a switch was thrown and then just as suddenly, it was completely gone. I was terrified."],"Date of the Event":"09/15/1976 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"Boxy shape with glowing orbs hovered then came forward, changing suddenly to sharp left and rising until gone almost instantly.
