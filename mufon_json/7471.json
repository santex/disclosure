i remember walking on the gravel of the dams base, an placed one knee on the lowest point of the ufo which was at a 45 degree angle, and i crawled the circunference of the ufo, until i was at the opposite site of the craft, and i saw a small opening, where i saw beautiful lights of magenta, red, blues, yellowa, pink, and gold, lights, which seem to draw me to them, (emphasis added!) i fell downward into the craft, an have screen memory which was brought out under hypnoist, after i came out of the craft i return to the housing units where the children were playing a game of (hide and seek), so i went into my apartment unit where i was in a state of confusion, as my mother was combing my sister hair, at which time i asked my mother if my sister was chinesse, being my family is hispanic, mexican american, i was in a state of confusion. moreover, at this time my mother sent me to my room as she was agitated with me for not reconizing my sister, i asked my mother if my sister was chinesse, as in elongated eyes, i believe from my experience in the craft i have no other explaination! other than the alien beings had wrapped around elongated eyes! after i went to my bedroom, i sat in my red sofa chair, at which time i levitated upward to the ceiling, and i felt the curtain rods, the ceiling light bulbs, as my feet dangled downward, i then floated downward to the red sofa, an came to rest on it. i told my mother what transpired in the bedroom and she said you need a plane ticket to fly, an became more agitated and sent me outside to play with the other children. the children were playing hide and seek, an as i was late coming to the game, i had to seek them out, i was instructed to count backwards from a 100 at a light post, at which time i feel into a stupor, at about 75 count, when i awoke i found myself at the roof of the 3 story apartment units, and i found the children one at a time in this method of some how levitating to the 3 story apartment roof top, hearing where the children were hiding and levitating downward until i stood in front of the children, at which point the children became afraid, saying how did he do that, i don't want to play anymore! by this time it was now dark outside, and the adults were outside caring for the children, i remember a man pitching a baseball into the sky and catching the ball with his glove, it had to be a full moon as i could see the ball as he caught the ball, on his third toss, i glanced upward, and saw a ufo the size of a basketball, follow the baseball downward, then circle the housing unit at which time it shape shift to a giant ufo over lapping the roof tops of the 3 story apartment units, with the same colors of magenta, gold pink, etc. as in the day time sighting. at this point the adults took the children into the apartments, and i went into my aunt and uncles apartment, as my parents were grocery shopping. when my parents return they took us home, an it was at this time i had my childhood ufo abductions, of abducting me from my bedroom apartment, and taking me to the same location of the base of the hansen dam, this transpired 3 times, and i told my parents, my mother then told me if i were to be taken into the craft again, as i reported to my parents of being seated in a chair in front of a large picture window, looking out into the blackness of space, and seeing millions of stars pass by at a great rate of speed, then the chair would shift into a different position, and the process would repeat itself. my mother got the idea of tearing the white bed sheets into strips, as she said if you fly tonight you'll take your brother, she then tied my hand and arm to my brothers hand and arm, and my leg to my brothers leg, an turned off the bedroom light. the childhood ufo abduction repeated itself again, at approx. 5:00 am my mother was making my fathers breakfast, and peeked into the bedroom, only to find the ufo aliens were not infalliable, as i was not tied to my brother but rather i was tied underneath, the bed itself, and my arm and legs were tied to the bedpost legs underneath the bed!
