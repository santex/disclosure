{"Region":"North Carolina","divs":["sighting detailslet me begin by saying that even though my chosen profession is nursing, i have been an avid skywatcher and stargazer since i was a child. when i look at the night sky, i know what i am looking for, i know what i am looking at, plain and simple. i happened to watch a program on tv just the other day titled \"the fayetteville incident\" which took place approximately one hour from my home near fayetteville, nc. the description of the ufo from that program reminded me of my incident. in fact, with the exception of the color of the craft, which the gentleman in that program described as orange, i believe we may have seen the same thing. also, i experienced 2 seperate incidents, the first involving 3 lights witnessed by myself and my sister and a second incident involving 1 light witnessed by myself and my 14 year old nephew. the first incident occurred sometime near the end of february or first of march 2008. i have simply forgotten the exact date but i am positive about the time of year because of orion's position in the sky, which i am very familiar with. i had been to my sister shawn's house for dinner and left between 9 and 9:30 so she and her younger 2 children could get ready for bed. as i stepped outside the house and closed the door behind me, i immediately began looking for and identifying constellations in the sky. there were no clouds, no moon and very little light pollution from any other source which made it quite easy. as i turned north to find polaris, i noticed a very bright light moving towards me from the north\\northeast. having been a flight nurse with an air ambulance company, i am somewhat familiar with various types of aircraft. i noticed right away there was a white light on the nose of the craft and being very, very bright, i assumed it was flying at a pretty low altitude. then i became aware that there was no typical triangulated blinking pattern indicating lights under the wings nor was the craft making any noise. i watched for a second then i stepped back to my sister's house and knocked on the door. she stepped outside and i pointed and asked her, \"what is that?\" we watched in silence as the first light turned west and headed away from us. we could then clearly see the back of the craft. it looked like a 3 story craft with 2 or possibly 3 white lights on each story. our attention then turned to a second light approaching from the same direction and traveling at the same speed. we watched it and i even jokingly said to her, \"what would you do if a third light appeared?\" she responded, \"run.\" not a minute later, indeed a third light approached us from the same direction. all 3 were the same, flying at lower altitudes, composed of 3 stories with white lights and moving slowly without making any noise whatsoever. we then both became aware of a slight noise coming from behind us and to the south. we turned in that direction and immediately realized that as the noise became louder, they were obviously military aircraft, 2 jets to be exact. we live approximately one hour from not only ft. bragg in fayetteville but also approximately one hour from seymour-johnston air force base in goldsboro. we are both quite familiar with the fighter jets and helicopters as they fly over our homes at times. we both agreed that more than likely they were f-15 strike eagles from seymour-johnston. as we turned back in the direction of the lights, we managed to get just a glimpse of them as they simply disappeared. there were no light trails as if they had accelerated, it was as if someone simply turned off a light switch. one fighter jet headed directly west in the same direction as the lights while the other continued north before turning east, making a complete circle then eventually heading west as well. both jets continued west until they disappeared. shawn was a little unnerved by the incident while i, being the scientist of the two and certainly a believer in et, was excited yet disappointed that i didn't get to ride in a ufo. the second incident occurred either near the end of july or first of august 2008. i distinctly remember because venus, mars, jupiter and saturn were visible at a little after 8 in the evening. at various times, i would \"kidnap\" my older nephews, kyle, 14 and shane, 12, and teach them a little about astronomy. on this prticular evening, kyle was outside walking up and down the path talking on his cell phone. cell phone reception in middlesex is unfortunately not very clear and being outside usually makes it a little better. it was approximately 9 pm when my phone rang. it was kyle calling from the yard. he said, \"jenny, come look at this light, is it venus?\" feeling very proud that my astronomy lessons had not been a total waste, i stepped outside and immediately saw what he was referring to. there was a bright white light situated to the southeast. althought this light was stationary and obviously a little farther away, the size and shape appeared to be similiar to the lights shawn and i had seen months earlier. it was harder to tell about the altitude because it wasn't heading towards me nor did it travel over my head. i immediately recognized that it wasn't venus. the positioning of the light was totally wrong as venus is always to the west\\southwest and although it is the brightest object in the night sky, it isn't that bright. also, venus had already set. although jupiter was in fact situated to the southeast, it's was lower than the light and it simply wasn't nearly as bright. i could also clearly see both jupiter and the light at the same time. suddenly, the light began to move slowly to the west. this startled kyle and he ran into the yard where i was. he said, \"what is that?\" i had told him and his brother earlier what shawn and i had seen so i said to him, \"well, it looks like what your mom and i saw.\" from my yard, my mom and dad's house is right in front of me and directly to the south. the light continued to move very slowly from the southeast until it was right over my mom and dad's house. it then accelerated at such a rapid rate that in my opinion, no human being could have withstood the g-forces and inertia that would have been involved. and i'm sure this light accelerated instead of simply disappearing because unlike before, this time there was a light trail. kyle and i both walked out further into the yard and looked to the west along the tree line but it had simply disappeared. we then heard the same noise as shawn and i had hear before. and just like before, 2 military jets screamed out of the south, turned to the west and disappeared. although this sighting had not lasted as long and i had not seen the light as clearly, it appeared to be the same thing i had seen before. in my opinion, it indeed was the very same thing."],"Case Number":"22193","Log
