(some background info will explain why: i once commuted each morning at the crack of down south along highway 29 in california, which travels through napa valley. every morning at certain periods of the year, hot-air balloons would appear on the horizon south of me as they generally launched in areas surrounding the town of napa, but not exclusively there. i would typically have about a half-hour of travel to the backside of the town of napa during which i could view the balloons from far away and close-up vantage points.) my brain held quite a catalog of memories as to the details of a hot-air balloon and after a few more looks at this object in the sky in vt, i could easily discern differences between it and the common hot-air balloon. (moreover, it was quite chilly that morning and at the altitude at which the balloon was travelling, the temperatures would make open-cockpit ballooning very uncomfortable so it didn't seem likely.) of course, at that point, i was still quite sure that the object was identifiable and that i just wasn't reaching a final conclusion as to what it was because as we traveled down the snaking highway, we would alternatively gain and lose sight of it, and our vantage point would change from eastern to western perspectives of it. finally, however, it was in view to the west of the road directly for about five miles of travel, and then i regarded it more thoroughly. once i was sure that it was not a hot-air balloon, i became very curious. when it was finally located directly to our west and we had a clearing across which to view it, i pulled the car over, and we got out to look at it. i took one photograph then with my digital camera, my girlfriend having taken one from her seat soon after we stopped. i concluded that we were looking at an unidentified\\able flying object. all i could keep saying to myself and out-loud was,\" what the hell is that thing?\" we left after a few minutes to continue on our way. it was not there when we returned north along the same road that afternoon. okay, now to the observations: 1. it was stationary; absolutely no apparent movement to it at all; it did not appear to move in the sky (neither vertically nor horizontally) and nor did it appear to rotate; 2. it was shaped much like a hot-air balloon (teardrop-like), but there was no obvious basket suspended from it (that fact coupled with #1 above ruled out the possibility that it was a hot-air balloon of the same design of those used in northern california for recreational purposes; moreover, after a few minutes standing in one place watching a hot-air balloon it is a very simple task to conclude that it is moving, even if it is moving directly away from you); 3. it was huge; that is, it appeared to be huge; watching it over the course of fifteen minutes of travel (at 70 mph) towards it, it never appeared to change in size to any great degree; that is, it never seemed that we were getting closer to it, and this reminded me of the effect that i experienced in alaska, where i have sea kayaked a few times: you could paddle towards the mountains in the distance (or away from them) for hours, even days, and they would never appear to get closer or father away (larger\\smaller); we called it the mother-f***ker effect; the mountains are just so huge that no change in size is discernable by the human eye on approach or retreat; the same with this object: it appeared to remain the same size from start of viewing til we traveled away from it; 4. it appeared to be a silvery object and we could not see the redness that is so apparent in the photo because its metallic surface reflected so strongly in the morning sun; it had a very steel-like metallic quality to its surface, or rather to the white surface band in the \"middle\" of it did; the edges of that band against the larger body appeared quite sharp and so seemed to extend out from the surface at a right angle to it, enough of a distance to cause a shadowed effect against the larger body (though i could not see that shadow really until i looked at the photographs later); 5. there were no lights visible on the object; 6. there was no audible sound coming from it. i think the realization that this was not an identifiable object to this individual was quite exciting, but it also had the effect of numbing me a bit, and i did not realize until later that we had actually seen something extraordinary. (thus only two photos were taken and no further attempt to view it was made.) in fact, i completely forgot about the photographs until the day of this submission when i stumbled upon them while organizing files; i was surprised to find that i could see slightly more detail in the photos than i could while viewing them with a naked eye, and that was exciting. but, looking at them did bring back the very eerie sense that i had had that day that i was viewing something otherwordly. as often as i have thought that it would be a great experience to witness such an unknown phenomenon, it was quite taxing to my brain to try and make sense of the object and the experience. it was perplexing to me. considering that in that area are located two potential sources for weather balloons or advanced aircraft of one sort of another (those being university of vermont and the plattsburgh, ny air force base), i would not rule out that possibility. however, the obviously large size and apparent stillness of the object (to the point of being unnerving) make it less likely than a skeptic would hope. i hope i have clearly and thoroughly described this sighting to you, and if you have any questions, please feel free to email me with them. and please, if anyone can identify this object, please inform me with supporting evidence or reference. thank you."],"Date of the Event":"05/06/2007 06:56 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Vermont","Longitude":"-73.15222"}
