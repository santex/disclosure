{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and I pulled up for a BBQ, when I looked up out of impulse and noticed a yellow orange glow moving north north east, almost over the ocean. I though It may have been a satellite because it didn't flash or pulse like a plane and looked lower than a plane, I also though it could of been a satellite because of the unblinking light but it moved too fast to be one as my step father pointed out. We stood there and watched it for a few minutes, it dissappeared once then reappeared. Then we went inside to our friends house.I tried to film it or take a photo on my iphone but the image turned out black possible because of the street light near us."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Forster","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/03/2012 04:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-32.182608,+152.513244(41382)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41382) map </A>","Region":"New South Wales","City":"Forster","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"-32.182608","Country":"Australia","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Summary":"Slow moving orange yellow glow","Log Number":"AU-08032012-0005","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"08/03/2012 06:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41382.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41382.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41382.html"],"Longitude":"152.513244","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"41382","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less"}
