WHILE I WAS TRAVELING ON SWEDESBORO RD [ RT 538 ] HEADING SOUTH I NOTICED A BRIGHT STATIONALY LIGHT OFF INTO THE DISTANCE STRAIGHT AHEAD. AS I PULLED UP TO MY DRIVEWAY I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND SAW THE LIGHT FALL TO THE GROUND. IT DISSAPEARED BEHIND THE TREE LINE. IT MAY OF LANDED NEAR THE MALAGA LAKE AREA. SINCE OUR AREA IS IN THE EXTENDED TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR PHILA INTERNATIONAL IT IS NORMAL TO SEE AIRPLANE LIGHTS FLY OVER OUR HOUSE AT NIGHT. IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR LANDING LIGHTS FROM AN AIRPLANE. IT WAS NOT A METEOR BECAUSE IT WAS STATIONARY IN THE SKY AND NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING. IT COULD OF BEEN MOVING TOWARD ME BUT I AM NOT SURE. WE CHECKED IN THE NEWS FOR PLANE CRASHES AND HEARD NOTHING."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"01/05/2007 04:00 UTC","Case Number":"6347"}
