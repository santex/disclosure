As I was peering in the sky to the east I noticed a Largeglowing object flying at aprox of 500-1500mph. Im guessing this bassed on thesight of how fast jet going by. It looked as if it was coming right through ourastmostphere and crashing far out into the ocean which is the view to my rightwhich is west. It fly as far as I could see still traveling at enourmous speedsand I didnt see it again. Shortly after the passing of this UFO I saw an F-16come by in the opposite patch of the ufo flying east at about the same altitudeas the object. I still to this day do not know what it was. Nothing in the newsabout anything like it in the area."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/05/2000 01:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Huge red and fiery flying object traveling at thou","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California"}
