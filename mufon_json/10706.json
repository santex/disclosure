{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI use the term ufo as unidentified. i was leaving work still on the work site at fermilab near the main ring. Me and my co-worker both saw something flying past close to us. it was at a low altitude. I got a photo but I dont know how good it came out. It was sort of kite shaped with a pod dangling underneath. it appeared to be smaller than an ultralight and it was moving under its own power. My thoughts were it was some sort of remote controlled drone. It was moving at a good rate of speed and after I slowed down and turned to get a look at it the thing changed directions and speed off. I dont know what this is. I believe it to be man made terrestrial origin, but it was odd."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10706.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10706_submitter_file1__ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10706.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10706.html"],"Case Number":"10706","City":"Batavia","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/08/2008 03:45 UTC","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.859788,+-88.304884(10706)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10706) map </A>","Summary":"saw something flying low alt smaller than ultralight with something dangling underneath","Longitude":"-88.304884","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"05/08/2008 03:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Wings","Log Number":"US-05092008-0002","Latitude":"41.859788","Object Shape":"Diamond, Square, Rectagular","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Batavia","There were no other sightings in Batavia on or around May 8th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
