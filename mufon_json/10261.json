{"divs":["sighting detailsi was setting up a telesope just after sunset. moon was a waxing cresent in the southwest and stars were just becoming visible. i looked up to the zenith at the brightest star, vega with my naked eye to begin a new observation. i noticed a movement in the due northern area and quickly spotted two blue-ish small spherical objects at very high altitude or low orbit. appearance was dimmer than the vega, almost a reflective quality softened by distance. the object sizes were identical, small orbs about the 3x the apparent size of vega. movement was due north to due south, one behind the other in identical tracking motion and tandem. the distance between these objects was 4 degrees. speed was approximately 2-3x faster than a satellite or high altitude aircraft. duration was 10-12 seconds, disappearing in the south about 25 degrees above the horizon. **note: 9\\19\\07 the following night at the same time i obseved a boomerang craft in exact same trajectory moving north to south but much faster. object was much larger, appearing about thumbnail sized with definite curved edges of wingtips and corners. object appeared reflective , casting ruddy color from high altitude light colors above the now darkening twilight of the evening sky. i estimate this object to be 20 times larger than any large military aircraft i am familiar with. possibly much larger, as it appeared to be in a high altitude orbit, well above the cirrus speed was very, very fast. traversed the sky in about 7 seconds. appeared about 25 degrees above northern horizon, and disappeared about 40 degrees above southern horizon. newscast on following tuesday by weatherman larry sprinkle reported seeing a similar object in charlotte nc, and showed photo on tv broadcast during daytime hours. local nbc channel 36\\cable channel 6. email request for information from tv studio recieved no reply. no information on their website."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:12","Case Number":"10261","Longitude":"-80.619344","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Sphere","Latitude":"35.488631","Date of the Event":"09/18/2007 08:42 UTC","Summary":"Two Spheres in Tandem","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Kannapolis","There were no other sightings in Kannapolis on or around September 18th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"09/18/2007 08:42 UTC","Log Number":"US-04112008-0006","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.488631,+-80.619344(10261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10261) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10261.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10261_submitter_file1__UFOTandem.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10261_submitter_file2__UFOBoomerang.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10261.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10261.html"],"Region":"North Carolina","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Kannapolis","Weather Factors":"None"}
