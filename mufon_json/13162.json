We had many people over to watch the fireworks on long lake in commerce twp. It was about 10:30-11:00 pm, we were watching the fireworks over the lake when we noticed an object moving east across the lake. we saw what appeared to be a very bright large sphere like object come from across the lake, it was heading west. I would say maybe 1 mile high. We all saw the object move slow across the sky over the lake. I would say it was travleing about as fast as a small plane. As it past over us we lost sight of it through the trees, we ran towards the back of the house but the object was gone out of sight by then. This was no firework or satellite. It was very large and had a bright red glow, it was moving in a straight horizontal path. I know everyone on that lake that night would have seen it, because they were all shooting off fireworks over the lake. I tried to get a picture of it with my cell phone but it was gone by the time I had it ready to take a picture."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Commerce","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
