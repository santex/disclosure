While I was waiting for them to finish, I looked up at the starts. As I looked up, I noticed a small object with red and white lights just above my neighbors house. I think there were three lights but I do not remember exactly. I took there looking at it wondering what it could be and I noticed the object was flying lower and coming closer toward me. It seemed to be doing a teetering or rocking motion. I stood there trying to make out what I was seeing. When the object neared the corner of my house, I quickly ran inside and locked my door. About five minutes later I grabbed my cell phone to see if I could get a video of it and it was no longer there."],"Object Features":"None","City":"Mingo Junction","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.29886","Date Submitted":"11/14/2012 08:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-11142012-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.29886,+-80.632004(43910)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43910) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/14/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mingo Junction","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
