Space Station?","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out back smoking a cigarette before bed, watching the night sky. Beyond the tree tops, a gold object came into view. Immediately I thought it look similar to a satellite, just moving a bit faster. The object had a direct path across the sky. It was much higher than a plane can go and much much larger also. As it passed over head, I could make out an elongated triagular head piece with a large blinking light on the top. There appeared to be separation and a cube coming off the back of the triangle. It looked like some type of space station, but I found that the space station doesn't have lights. This object absolutely had a large blinking light on the front. The best description I can give to the overall experience is a \"space station missile\". I believe this was a man made object just because of the flight path and steady blinking light. Whatever it was, it was large."],"Date of the Event":"08/21/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.419817,+-82.902173(31292)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31292) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31292.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31292.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/29/2011 06:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
