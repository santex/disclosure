{"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","divs":["sighting detailsi was checking my mail box at the entrance of the building where i live when i noticed a very bright red light crossing the sky. my wife was in the balcony at the 3rd floor and i immediatel told her to watch the sky. she immediately saw the light. i took my smartphone and start recording a video (poor quality). when the light went no more visible to me i asked my wife to keep follow the light in order to report me later what it have do (change directions, change color or other, but it did not). the light hide under some clouds, after it crossed the sky from w to e\\se. i did not know what it could be. i'm totally sure it's not a plane since there is civil airport at few km from where i live and i know how airplane are in the daylight and in the night. maybe it could be a meteo baloon but my supposition is only becouse i do not know meteo baloon and i don't how how they are. it was very fast to be a wind-moved ballon : it seemed to be some sort of vehicle."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44821.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44821.html"],"City":"Quartu Sant'elena","Date of the Event":"12/27/2012 10:46 UTC","Case Number":"44821","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"9.194035","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"IT-12282012-0003","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.227998,+9.194035(44821)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44821) map </A>","Region":"Sardegna","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"Italy","Latitude":"39.227998","Date Submitted":"12/28/2012 03:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"very bright light (star-like) red coloured cross the sky from N to S-E/E.","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Quartu Sant'elena","There were no other sightings in Quartu Sant'elena on or around December 27th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Flash"}
