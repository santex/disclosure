I was telling him about the orbs I had seen earlier this morning at my work. I pointed to the cottonwood 'cotton' that has been flying in the sky and mentioned that I was not seeing cotton but white orbs. Just as I said that we both saw a white orb much higher up in the sky traveling from northeast to northwest. My husband estimates that the object was traveling about Mach 2 or 3 (he is an aviation enthusiast) and no sonic boom was detected."],"Log Number":"US-06192009-0024","Date Submitted":"06/19/2009 01:55 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
