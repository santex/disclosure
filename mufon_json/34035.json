I glanced toward the southern part of the city and noticed what appeared to be an object or objects with appendages and lights miving south. I tried shutting the phone call and turning on the camers but by that time i lost track and it disappeared. Iand tt reminded me of those spiked drones (star like) that haeen reported. There were lights but judging the size and distance had to be much larger. Im familiar with all types of aircraft that fly around nyc and this was not one of them. I made my observation on the queens side of the east river by the 59 th st. bridge."],"Case Number":"34035","Summary":"observed object flying north to south over manhattan or hudson river","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around December 14th 2011"],"Latitude":"40.786654","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34035.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34035.html"],"Region":"New York","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/14/2011 08:03 UTC","Log Number":"US-12152011-0008","Longitude":"-73.95789","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
