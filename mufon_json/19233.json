This was in the Adirondacks in the town of Warrensburg. I was gazing up at the sky when I saw what appeared, at first, to be a star. Suddenly however, it began to move in a straight line. It moved relatively slow, and did not appear to be a plane or a helicopter. Following this, another object began to move. This was in close proximity to the other, and was slightly larger, and appeared as a reddish brown or orange colored light that was not extremely bright, but clearly visible. I do not recall how I lost sight of the objects."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Saw what looked like a star suddenly begin to move in a straight line.
