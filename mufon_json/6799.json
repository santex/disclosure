He was approximately ten and I was about nine. I was asleep. He began tapping on me to awaken me. When I opened my eyes I saw a three inch long cigar shaped, illuminated object, pulsating with light, hovering above our heads. It scared me so badly that I got up and ran in the house to tell my parents. He chased the object for about a block. He said it moved at right angles - moving up several feet to avoid a wall, than moving forward, then moving up again several feet, then moving forward again. He states that it was more the size of a hot dog. I still believe that it was smaller."],"Longitude":"-79.992056","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
