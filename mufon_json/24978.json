It looks like a star, but if you know your neighborhood sky like I do, I knew it was something else. THis morning on the way to work, I came down my steps and saw it again. It was in front of my house at a distance. It stayed for about 30 minutes. Planes approaching Hartfield Airport HAD TO SEE THIS. Its no way a Captain of a jetliner did not see this. I grabbed my camera and took shots and video. Just like it did earlier in the week, the light faded away and was GONE. Can someone take a look at these shots and tell me what the hell is this? Please email me your comments. If someone has video enhancing software, I believe you will BE AMAZED at what you see."],"Latitude":"33.923714","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","City":"Dallas","Region":"Georgia","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.840773","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
