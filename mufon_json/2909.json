{"Date of the Event":"03/07/0001 07:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsGoing to get the mail, bright light blue sky with patchy clouds-high, always seeballoons, these seemed too large but Ill always say they could be balloons,however, at this distance they would be as large as the front end of a largeplane. They alternated black and silver as if the sun was reflecting as theywere rotating-as two balloons would do if spinning around eachother, one alittle lower than the other tied together. There were two. The one that washigher disappeared from my sight quickly, the other remained for a few minutesascending as a balloon would ascending a large imaginary spiral staircase. These were above and near Nellis AFB-I think-roughly above old Henderson. I wasstanding at home near the 215 and 15 roughly looking toward the intersection ofthe 215 and the 95. It appeared to be a bit further than that---east, was Ilooking Im one year new here from Thousand Oaks, CA. P.S. My wife said sheheard on the news earlier that day there was going to be some fast flying jetsin the area."],"Object Flight Path":"Other,Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.047695,+-114.975481(2909)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2909) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-114.975481","Date Submitted":"03/07/0001 07:00 UTC","City":"Henderson","Log Number":"","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.047695","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Above Henderson, NV-Black and Silver Orbs","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2909.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2909.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Henderson","There were no other sightings in Henderson on or around March 5th 0001"],"Case Number":"2909","Country":"United States","Region":"Nevada","Object Shape":"Oval","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
