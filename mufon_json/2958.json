But it was moving slowly from NW to W and then it stood still inthe sky and when I came inside it was still there. It kinda seemed to changeshape more than once at least 3 times and when I left, had maintained shape of asphere comprised of flat plates of...something. The light was shining throughmost of this thing, but there were clearly designed strips betweeen lights ofwhat I assume is metal. The thing also appeared to be emitting some kind ofparticles or beams or perhaps its a space lifeform and it was a tail of somekind from its base. slightly angled to my right when I look up and to the west.45 degrees roughly, i suck at math sorry.
