As I sat down I began skywatching. Looking at the clouds, I just happened to notice a White dot high in the sky. At first i thought it was a bird but as i kept watching i noticed that the object appeared to not be moving and at an extremely high altitude. At that time an airliner happened to be traveling in the same direction, and still this object appeared to be thousands of feet higher than the jet. As i continued to watch i noticed that the object was very slowly moving across the sky from the southeast to the northwest. This object was high above the clouds, and i continued to watch it until i could no longer see due to buildings obstructing my view."],"trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around March 20th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.044014,+-84.499206(22411)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22411) map </A>","Region":"Kentucky","Log Number":"US-03202010-0018","City":"Lexington","Summary":"Orb-like ufo at extreme high altitude","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
