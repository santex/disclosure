{"Log Number":"US-09022008-0017","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside watering my trees, walking back inside my house I noticed in the southeastern sky what looked like a floating black circle object. The sphere had a bright white light in the center and red light spinning around. Stopping to watch, I noticed it moved closer making no sound and moved slowly to the northeast. The object seemed to move back and forth. I watched it till I could no longer see it to the east. I have no idea what this could have been; I even called my girlfriend and son out to see it and they were not sure either."],"Region":"California","Summary":"Black circle with bright white light in center and red light spinning around.","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-116.540132","City":"Palm Springs","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Palm Springs","There were no other sightings in Palm Springs on or around September 2nd 2008"],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2008 06:23 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/02/2008 06:23 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"00:05:30","Latitude":"33.834496","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12324.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12324.html"],"Case Number":"12324","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.834496,+-116.540132(12324)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12324) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City"}
