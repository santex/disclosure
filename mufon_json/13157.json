The best way i can describe the noise is that it sounded like an incoming missile. Almost as if something was breaking the sound barrier, or trying to enter or leave the earths atmosphere. The sound started off quiet as if far away, and after a few seconds was near deafening. Upon hearing the sound, we looked up in the sky and noticed what appeared to be a star, except it was moving. Upon looking at the star-like object closer we realized it was flashing different colors, red, blue, green, maybe even some yellow........and it was doing this VERY fast. I noticed that on the ufo stalker website there are ALOT of similar experiences lately, all describing what I am describing. I just thought i'd let everyone know they aren't alone, and I too have seen this mysterious star-like light"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
