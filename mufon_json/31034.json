I tried to capture video of it but my camera is cheap and it didnt register on my video. My heart was racing, I have never seen anything like it in my life... there were no blinking lights or indications that it was a normal aircraft. It really freaked me out... my husband saw it as well."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31034.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31034.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.406337","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Independence","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.100576","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.100576,+-94.406337(31034)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31034) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"08/19/2011 08:30 UTC"}
