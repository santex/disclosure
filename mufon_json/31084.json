Dark object crossing freeway from West to east. No reference point to determine size or altitude. Thought it might have been a bird or airplane. Object appeared to bank to its right and revealed 5 or 6 bright white lights in a straight line on its upper surface. Not a configuration that should be on any aircraft and not a bird. Object then appeared to bank to it's left and then became small and could no longer be seen. Wondered what it was. Have seen kites flying west of the freeway near 6 mile road, but this did not resemble anything seen there before. Thought it might be a model airplane but it was operating far from where anyone could have controlled it."],"Date Submitted":"08/22/2011 09:51 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
