I had a \"feeling\" that would occur at times that would transport me to the incident. as I got older and we moved away from the area I got into meditatiun and wanted to allieviate the neurosis. so I would ask for clarity of the incident and I got way more than I bargained for. It seems that I was taken.I believe the ritual slaying was a screen memory to defer the trauma. There is so much more to the story and quite frankly I am not a good typist. I would like to explore this further. I have hadd many many experiences throughout the years that were either unexplained or just too weird to share with others for fear of ridicule. There are several where witnesses are involved which is truly the only reason I don't just chuck it all to an exagerated imaginatoin."],"Source":"MUFON"}
