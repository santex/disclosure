When i looked at the recording i was stunned of what i saw and couldn't believe what i had caught on film. The first ufo flew passed at high speeds and it kinda wobbled in a straight slanted line and at the same time turning upside down and then downside up. The second ufo dropped down like a tear drop at high speeds and it had like an American Eagle shape to it at one point. I felt so stunned at first to spot something pass the moon so fast and through my camcorder. I immediately went to show my girlfriend and friends right after i caught it on film. After the sighting, i began my research on my laptop and watched the video over 100 times to finally come to a conclunsion that these were U.F.O.'s"],"Latitude":"41.854438","City":"Cicero","Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"Illinois","Longitude":"-87.753275","Sighting Duration":"00:00:06","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43637.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43637.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"two U.F.O's fly pass the moon at high speeds","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"43637","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11012012-0002","Object Features":"Wings, Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 10:59 UTC"}
