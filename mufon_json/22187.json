After getting back on the interstate she noticed how bright the stars were in the sky and that's when she saw the orange orb. She says that it was shooting across the sky and not towards the earth. After just a few second a smaller orb detached from the main one and travled in the same direction before fading out of sight. My wife who usually doesn't want to talk about UFO's called me excited about what she had just seen. She also stated that it appeared to her to be moving to fast to be an aircraft and there are not any airports in the area."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22187.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22187.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Chattanooga","There were no other sightings in Chattanooga on or around March 6th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-03072010-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"22187","City":"Chattanooga","Latitude":"35.038222","Longitude":"-85.354965","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.038222,+-85.354965(22187)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22187) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/07/2010 04:22 UTC","Summary":"Orange orb shot across the sky before a smaller orb broke away from it"}
