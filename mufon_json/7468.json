All of a sudden I got this creepy feeling that someone was watching me. I looked around and spotted a large disc-shaped UFO hovering about 6 feet above our one-car garage. Its width was about the same as the length of the garage. The object was black and silver, but I can't recall if the top or bottom was silver. Also, one of the halves was rotating slowly, but I can't recall which one. Although the object was hovering in place, it did so in a kind of unsteady manner. I was about 30-40 feet away from it as I watched it. I decided to run upstairs and tell my parents, but when they got to the window, the object was gone."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Date of the Event":"05/31/1978 01:00 UTC","Case Number":"7468","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7468.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7468.html"],"Region":"New Jersey","City":"Garfield","Log Number":"US-07172007-0002","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.881488,+-74.113198(7468)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7468) map </A>","Object Features":"Dome","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Summary":"Daylight Disk Sighted in Garfield, N.J.","Latitude":"40.881488","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-74.113198"}
