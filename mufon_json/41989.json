{"divs":["sighting detailsi was on my deck patio, in north laguna beach, covering my bbq at around 9:00pm. i was facing south when i noticed 6 or 7 bright glowing red lights in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon, above or just south of laguna beach. the lights were glowing red\\orange like fire. they did not appear to be solid, crisp structures. they were steadily moving northbound and maintained their altitude. a couple of the lights appeared to move side to side occasionally as they moved forward, which seemed very unusual. this was a brazen display and could not be missed. i didn't notice any sounds, aside from the usual sound of the ocean. i was a bit stunned but i managed to get one photo with my iphone. i rushed into my apartment to grab my digital camera so i could shoot video; however, by the time i turned it on, the lights faded out and were gone. they did not change direction; they just gradually faded out as they were still moving northbound. the incident lasted about 3-4 minutes max. i did not see the objects appear, as i noticed them when they were already there. i don���t know how long they were there before i saw them. about 2 minutes after the objects disappeared, a commercial airliner flew overhead, heading southwest."],"Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/24/2012 03:07 UTC","Summary":"6-7 red/orange lights above Laguna Beach moving northbound","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Laguna Beach","There were no other sightings in Laguna Beach on or around August 23rd 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.548538","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/23/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41989.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41989.html"],"Case Number":"41989","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.548538,+-117.77967(41989)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41989) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"California","Longitude":"-117.77967","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Laguna Beach","Log Number":"US-08242012-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
