{"Case Number":"2938","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was around 430am. I had been awake for quite a while. I was getting hungry soI went upstairs to cook some lasagna in the microwave. During the 6 minutes ittook to cook, I looked outside my balcony window as I often do, in hopes of aUFO sighting. It was a clear nightmorning, many stars were visible and therewasnt a cloud in sight. Frustrated with never seeing any objects, I mentallyexpressed something to the nature of if any aliens exist, please show yourselvesnow and I will be very grateful. Lo and behold this circular object veryreminiscent of a star in shape and size, flying much much higher than any planeI had ever seen, begun to slowly dance across the sky. It was glowingwhiteish-yellow, brighter than a star and begun flying in 4 or 5 S formationsfor about 30-45 seconds before it disappeared out of the range of my windowview.During the encounter I was very calm and remained skeptical. However, I wasalmost instantly convinced by the UFOs movements that it could not be a plane ora satelitte.This was my first encounter. Rather uneventful but Ill take what I can get."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","Date of the Event":"11/30/2003 04:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.42576,+-75.695213(2938)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2938) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2938.html"],"Latitude":"45.42576","City":"Ottawa","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There were no other sightings in Ottawa on or around November 30th 2003"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/30/2003 04:30 UTC","Longitude":"-75.695213","Summary":"High altitude circular object floating across sky","Source":"MUFON"}
