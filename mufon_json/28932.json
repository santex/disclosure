At which time I seen a very bright starlike object move across the sky. It could not have been more than 75-100 yards up. It was metallic, but the metal put off such a glow that it was almost hard to look at. Just after passing under the Big Dipper a smaller not so bright object seemed to eject from the object and flew off in the opposite direction at a much greater speed than the large object. It was not a shooting star, as it didn't appear to be moving very fast. It took about 4 minutes from the time it entered my view to the point that i couldnt see it anymore."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Marshall","There were no other sightings in Marshall on or around May 3rd 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Marshall","Tags":"City"}
