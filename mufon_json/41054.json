It was bright orange in colour it flew left (south) then disappeared. Light reappeared (aprox 10min later) in same spot it appeared in. Then flew left (south) again slowed down then slowly disappeared. It looked like it flew possibly into the distance. We have enough time to find camera and video. Light reappeared again in same spot and stayed in one spot. We videoed. Light looked orange to naked eye, but in video it looks like a red light going in a circle around object. Light faded into nothing. We were curious as to what it is, that is why we videoed it. after the sighting we googled it to see if anyone else has seen the same thing,"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Tags":"City"}
