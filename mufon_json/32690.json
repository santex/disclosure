In hopes to capture something on video i sat on our drive way with a camera and a pack of smokes for hours, on numerous occations. to my amazment i was able to get two videos, of what i had seen previous, with in two months of eachother. the second sighting and video is what i am reporting today. while sitting on a lawn chair i noticed to the west of my position, what appeared to be a star. after watching it for a moment i noticed it slowly rise up from its position over regina sk a few degrees. It then began moving toward my position. as the ball of light became closer it started appearing larger and brighter! once it was directly above me i reclined the lawnchair and took my eye off of it for a second. once i got into a comfortable position i started looking for object which just moved above me, however i could not see it moving and i was looking at a sky full of stars. after pointing my camera directly above my position for about 20-30 seconds, i was sure that what ever it was that came over top of me had vanished literaly in the blink of an eye! i ran into my house to see if i had got it dissapearing on video and to my amazment it had stopped moving in a south east direction, and was hovering above me for about 5 seconds, then it takes off verticaly and dissapears in a short few seconds out of sight. ever since my last sighting i have almost religiously been searching for more ufos and have seen one since. however,I was not able to capture it on video but this video is proof that i did see something strange that night and i know it was out of this world!"],"City":"Regina","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:10","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.461322,+-104.603957(32690)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32690) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32690.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32690.html"],"Region":"Saskatchewan","Longitude":"-104.603957","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"CA-10182011-0008","Summary":"it moved directly above me, stopped for a moment and then took off vertically"}
