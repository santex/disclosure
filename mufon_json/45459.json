On more than one occasion (around 6 times now) we have seen these orange orbs that appear to be low in altitude and completly sound less as they have passed straight over my head. These are all individual occasions and only seeing one at time over a period of 2 years now. I have been present at every siting, and my friends have see them on their own.(I'm not including those) We are also experiencing a light that shines bright and star like in color (bluish) that lights up brighter than any other objects in the sky except the moon. Golf ball sized. It appears out of nowhere. It gets real bright moves a little than vanishes. It has been seen on 3 separate occasions. All of these have are different times, dates, and direction of travel. Now I don���t go out just to look at stars but I���m becoming a UFO hunter. On two ocaasions I have got the feeling to go outside and look up and seen the organge orb."],"Latitude":"35.20937","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Case Number":"45459","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.20937,+-91.829473(45459)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45459) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"01/28/2013 06:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/01/2012 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01282013-0016"}
