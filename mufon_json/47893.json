When I looked up I saw a bright, white light that was moving and appeared to be larger and lower than other stars. I ran inside and asked my partner to come and look at the object as witness. We watched the single,bright oval object steadily cross the sky with a slight wobble, no sound, just above the trees, street and river (approx.500+ft in altitude). We viewed the object for about a minute until we lost sight of it behind the trees. I did manage to capture it on video."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/04/2013 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/05/2013 11:40 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-68.817843","Region":"Maine","Summary":"Large, bright, white light, 500+ft above the tree line moving from South to East.","Case Number":"47893","City":"Bangor","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Bangor","There were no other sightings in Bangor on or around June 4th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
