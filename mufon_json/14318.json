The circle was so big the moon looked like a marble. there was big X going through the circle not as thick as the circle it self. The X began to fade like airplane smoke and about 20 mins later another X was made and that one also dissappeared. The circle stayed around the moon the entire night until I feel asleep. the moon moved and the circle followed it with the moon still dead in the middle. And during the first X I also saw a shooting star or what I think was one. I'm 33 and my parents live next door and I called my mother and she came outside and also so this. Since she's older and from down south I thought she might know what it was. She had no idea just like me, so I was hoping you can explain what happened. The shooting star thing with everything else I saw is what really made me send this message. If it was nothing still PLEASE contact me and let me know. Thank you"]}
