{"divs":["Sighting Detailsan object, white no blinking lights was moving from north to south at an unknown altitude (probably 20000 ft) moved in a strait line then faded from sight in a clearly marked leaving the earths atmosphere pattern. This was a clear case of a vehicle leaving the planet, it was in the area of sky dominated by the orion constellation. as I reiterate it was plain that this object was definitely leaving the planets atmosphere. there was an airplane in the vicinity but I don't think it was connected in any way since that plane was probably at about 8-10 thousand feet"],"Log Number":"US-04282012-0004","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Granbury","Case Number":"37799","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37799.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37799.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.449723,+-97.786597(37799)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37799) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"32.449723","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/28/2012 01:50 UTC","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"04/27/2012 10:00 UTC","Summary":"this was a direct path ufo that obviousy left the atmosphere","Longitude":"-97.786597","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Granbury","There were no other sightings in Granbury on or around April 27th 2012"]}
