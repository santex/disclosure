There were three lights that came on at different times and stayed on for about 30 seconds each 3 times the object appeared and they all went off at different times... At the time of the first sighting there was a second object off to and above to the left of the main object... It only had one light that came on one time at the time of the first sighting of the object with 3 lights..... The single light object went out slowly and then the object with 3 lights went out slowly each light going out seperately.... The object lights were of golden color more golden than the average car headlight... We saw airplanes taking off from our right which was the area of Tallahassee Airport approx. 20 miles away, we saw Military aircraft come into the area at a high altitude with just their small strobe light and appear to be watching the event or trying to figure out what was going on... Tyndall Air Force base just west of Panama City, Fla. is only about 5 minutes flying time to the area in question...... The military aircraft appeared to be approx. 3 in number at first and then they left the area, another on approached from the area of Tyndall and went to approx. the last location of our sighting, it made a turn and went back toward Tyndall... The object I saw appeared 3 times from 8:30 PM eastern to around 8:55 PM... Each time the object appeared it was stationary but in a different location each time... The lone light object never appeared more than once and it was stationary also... The 3 light object probably moved about a few miles from each location... The object started on my right, appeared the second time more to my left and the last time it appeared it was back to my right but not as far as the first time.. Each time it appeared the lights came on one at a time and stayed on for about 30 seconds and went off one at a time except the last time a glow appeared between the 3 lights and then they went off one at a time and it was not seen again... At this time is when (what seemed like)a military plane came in to the area checked and left back toward Tyndall.... The object was low on the horizon so no one in a neighborhood would be able to see because of our wooded areas around here... It was approximately at 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon, no further..... My guess is that it was bout 10 miles to my South from my location... There was NO MOVEMENT AT ALL WHILE THE LIGHTS WERE ON FROM EITHER OBJECT..........????????? My reaction was that I'll never go to that lake again without my video camera... I do video and photography for a living and I have never seen an object like this in my 53yrs..... I wasn't scared because it looked just like the Phoenix lights, Maybe more golden..... My friend who saw the same object said what we saw was really weird and he couldn't describe how he felt except it was really weird, he was more frieked out because he really hadn't seen the reports of the Phoenix lights..... I'm also hold a commercial helicopter pilot's license.."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Florida","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.445476,+-84.277633(5603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5603) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/19/2006 08:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5603.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5603.html"],"Disposition":"IFO"}
