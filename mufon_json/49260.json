He was looking up and out the window at an enormous triangle craft gliding by (only see the underside). It was covered entirely on the underside with white and blue white lights . ( hundreds).It continued in its way , making no sound until it disappeared from view. It seemed to be very low. When I awoke in the morning it had carved a huge path through the clouds. It had moved in a straight line from the southwest to the northeast, over my building. I was shocked at the enormous size of the craft,could have fit many, many commercial jets in this triangle. It completely blocked out two 23 inch windows as it went by."],"Country":"Canada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49260.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"lying in bed observed large triangle moving silently southwest to northeast, blocking out two 23inch windows as it glided by","Longitude":"-79.343486","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around June 15th 2013"],"Log Number":"CA-07282013-0020","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.70726","Region":"Ontario","City":"Toronto","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"07/28/2013 04:14 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/15/2013 01:45 UTC"}
