This event i've watched two times in 2004. I was in M���nster and walking at that time, as I noticed this strange formation, it was so huge that one couldn't miss it. I immediately saw that it was an extraordinary triangle, not a normal formation of planes. I tryed to explain it as a formation of planes, but this formation was so huge and perfect and there were no flashing lights that i rejected this explanation. I was really amazed and excited and watched it until it disappeared like satellites do."],"Case Number":"11980","Longitude":"7.625539","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:10","Summary":"huge bright triangle moved into three lights in a line","Date of the Event":"08/29/2004 02:09 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Germany","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11980.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11980.html"],"Log Number":"DE-08082008-0006","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City"}
