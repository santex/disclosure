You have to slow the film down quite a bit. The UFO that comes into frame on the right has discernable structure and an observation dome at the top. I've provided the video, and two photos enhanced using IRIS astronomy software to extract details of the second craft's structure. Note the first picture shows a near-IR picture of my windows \"cross bars\", and an observation dome at the top of the craft. The second picture, also extracted from the video and also enhanced with wavelet algorithms, shows two exhaust-type structures underneath the craft."],"Summary":"Two UFOs peeling off into the sky, observed from window"}
