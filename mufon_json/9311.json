Look up there!\" As I looked up in the sky I saw two star looking objects falling downwards like shooting stars. At first that's what I thought they were until they changed their direction of travel and moved right and left. What I seen that day I cannot explain and I am interested to see if anyone else saw the same thing I saw. What I saw that day I swear was unexplainable. My mom never believed in UFO's until that day she told me. The objects continued to zoom back and forth up there also gradually going down until they lowered behind a hill and we werent able to see them anymore. I recorded video of one of the objects on my camera phone. Its all I had to take video footage of the object. I need to know if anyone else saw these objects on this day. The surprising thing was there was a plane flying next to it."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Case Number":"9311","Log Number":"US-01282008-0001","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in La Habra Heights","There were no other sightings in La Habra Heights on or around January 27th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9311.html"],"Country":"United States"}
