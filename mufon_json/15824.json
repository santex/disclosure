{"divs":["sighting detailsok, don't really think this is a ufo in the alien sense. but it was rather strange, so i'll see what people have to say. it was last november and i only remember it now because i stumbled across the videos i took. i was sitting outside in my backyard one sunny afternoon when i noticed a bright\\reflective light in the sky. no reason i noticed it... just happened to look up. at first it was just odd, but the longer i watched it the more it didn't seem to fit anything i could think of. i guess i would best describe it as a star, except it was in the day. it was about that shape and perhaps that shine. it seemed to fly across the sky like a star would, except i'm pretty sure it went a bit quicker than a star would have. i showed it to someone else and we both watched it for some time. at times it would disappear altogether... maybe as if it was disk shaped and rotated so that it didn't reflect and so appeared invisible? it would seem like a satellite or a planet, but something about it made us dismiss this idea at the time. i think because it didn't go in a strict straight orbit. seemed to go faster and slower at times. and move back. we kept trying to shoot pictures of it and look at it through a (very rickety) telescope. eventually it went out of our line of vision, behind the house or something. so... any ideas? a quasar? satellite? alien visitors? i did take a couple videos but it was so small that it's really hard to make out and i think very little could be learned from them. however, if it would interest anyone, i'll post them."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15824.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15824.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784411,+-119.409732(15824)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15824) map </A>","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03032009-0021","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"Bright, flashing object in the daytime sky.","Longitude":"-119.409732","Date of the Event":"11/11/2008 03:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Case Number":"15824","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"11/11/2008 03:00 UTC","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.784411"}
