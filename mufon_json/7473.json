I was trying to spot some lightning, because it was stormy, and the storm was almost directly above us. I spotted a fireball in the sky. It was just hovering there. Then it went out, and a second, brighter one appeared. After a short while, the first reapppeared. They quickly vannished though. When I first saw them, I took a video on my Sony Ericcson W300i phone, which I attached to this. I stopped recording when the fireballs disappeared."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.669783,+-2.674662(7473)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7473) map </A>","Latitude":"53.669783","Region":"England"}
