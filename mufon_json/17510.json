My neighbors house litterely right up next to mine I was able to just see it come over and fly at about several hundred feet up and a quarter mile away moving south. It was closest from when it came from NE it just appeared round and white could not make any distinguishable marks no wings no propelers no sound. It was very small and very far away. It moved slowly away moving against the wind. And sometimes just stationary. At one point a airliner flew just right by it as though the pilot did not see it. I am usure just what it is but a least I took a few photos using a binocular with a camera a regular camera could not make it out as it was to far away."],"Longitude":"-73.611913","Date Submitted":"06/14/2009 06:00 UTC"}
