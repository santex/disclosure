{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the night of august 4 2011 I saw flying lights at around 845 pm in Kingman Arizona. I was driving down the road and I was facing east. I saw 4 strange lights in a weird pattern I decided that something was not right so I knew the road I was on went out into the desert so I went about 5 miles out of town and now there was 8 lights in the sky in different patterns from horizontal lines to rectangles to circles. As soon as I got to the desert there was another car already out there and one soon showed up and then a few minutes later there was 4-5 cars including mine. Having a truck and it being the desert I went out as far as I could and I go to I would say about 2 miles away. I was standing lights of and I knew they were not airplanes because they were just sitting there but being so close I also didn���������t hear any helicopter noises I took a bunch of pictures and the last one was when they were in a rectangle and then they started to circle the city it seemed and then they all started going towards the ground and where most of them flew I knew there was departments so I decided to head out that way and I think I saw one on the ground but as soon as I parked my car a cop seemed to appear out of nowhere and he asked me if I had a problem I responded if I was trespassing and he said I wasn���������t and so I started to tell him about the lights and showed him the pictures. He then proceeded to tell me that there are new aircraft that hover and don���������t make noise but I haven���������t heard of anything like that. I said I should go and he goes good Idea and as I was turning my car around he turned left to go where the lights had seemed to land. The whole cop thing seemed rather suspicious and it just didn���������t feel right I was out in the middle of nowhere and I didn���������t even see him coming but take that for what it is worth. I then went home and looked up the number to call and report I tried calling a couple of times and it was busy and then I started to see the lights again this time they were heading south and they were in a horizontal formation I went had gotten gas and that���������s when I tried take more pictures and only one came out and it seems really weird. When I was looking at the lights I was able to get through and the person told me to try and get as many people to look and report. I got in my car and started to head south but they just seemed to disappear rather quickly I saw them and then I didn���������t see them I tried waiting around but then I had to be somewhere at midnight that is why I am writing the report so late. I will include pics in the email and try and describe them. The lights every time I saw them where just white and they did blink but only sometimes and I didn���������t see any other color. Also no noise at all and moved methodically I have 10 pics 1 video"],"Latitude":"35.262525","City":"Kingman","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 06:40 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/04/2011 08:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"30657","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were 3 other sightings in Kingman on or around August 4th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30657_submitter_file1__photo7.PNG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30657_submitter_file2__photo4.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30657_submitter_file3__photo10.PNG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30657.html"],"Summary":"ufo sighting kingman az","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-114.020423","Region":"Arizona","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.262525,+-114.020423(30657)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30657) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08062011-0075","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Oval"}
