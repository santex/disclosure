In the parking lot we saw a bright orange light with same color streak trailing behind it. The object was over the bay, it made no sound. It was very bright lasting about 30 sec. Then it completly disappeared. Then reappeared about 30 sec. later in the same location but was moving in a upwards arc. This time lasting about 40sec. Then disappeared. Two more times same occurance, same duration. And no sound and no other signs of anything after the light went out. I recorded the incident on my cell phone which I will upload tommorrow. The people that saw the object could not understand or think what the object could of been."]}
