{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-104.040453","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home, thought being chased. When I came over the hill toward my remote home I saw 15 objects sitting still hovering. Seemed to be emitting light energy. I went into house and got video camera. Took lots of video adn I think even an entity and maybe some rods. I felt anxious and my heart was racing while doing the video taping. I felt OK after. The alien looked like a demon to me. I kept taping until the battery died on the camera then I went into the house and stayed awake to daylight as I was a little anxious over what I saw. Digital tape being duplicated and DVD will be given to MUFON State Director."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"6128","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.617592,+-104.040453(6128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6128) map </A>","City":"Deer Trail","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/25/2006 11:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6128.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6128.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Deer Trail","There were no other sightings in Deer Trail on or around July 25th 2006"],"Date Submitted":"07/25/2006 11:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.617592","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01102007-0006","Summary":"Several objects video taped"}
