Then, I looked up into the sky, and I saw a huge light, I thought at first it was a star, or the Moon. Then, I noticed the light grew brighter, and it started to move in a circular motion, like a ball going down a solid whirlpool. I felt really scared, and excited at the same time, because I didn't know what it was, or if it was gonna come closer to me. As we drove away, the object started to pulsate, and then fade away."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Blimp","Date Submitted":"08/12/2011 12:37 UTC","Longitude":"-75.159789","Latitude":"39.961725","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
