A very strange moving object was moving up in the sky to my left over a cattle field. I pulled over and blinked my lights at it, and it seemed to blink back. Not really sure it was for me, as it blinked before. Two other cars passed me but didn't seem to notice it. It moved and looked like several rubber bands, up, down, back and forth. The color was beautiful, blue and white. It amazed me at first then I became a little uncomfortable and left. I truely believe it was not of this earth!!!! Then, about a week later, I was outside my home, in the yard at night, looked up and saw a very smaller version of the exact thing. I went to get my husband, but the time he came outside it was gone. I only wish that there is someone out there that saw the same thing or even a picture would be wonderful."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
