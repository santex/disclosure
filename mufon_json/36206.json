I was checking my water cistern over the rooftop at home, so I was carrying a flashlight and I soon as I finished my job there, I was pointing my flashlight to the sky, like \"playing\" with the light beam. Then, I saw this object, right above of my head, like a 400 or 500 meters from the ground, a black triangle with dim red lights at the corners. It wasn't making any kind of sound or leaving fume trail either, just flying in straight line with a left turn to the east until it was impossible to distinguish it from the other stars in the horizon. I think it was flying over at high speed because it took maybe no more than 15 secs. from the first time I saw it above my head and when it faded at the distance."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/02/2012 02:19 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Mexico","City":"Guadalajara","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=20.679217,+-103.314695(36206)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36206) map </A>","Case Number":"36206","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Jalisco","Latitude":"20.679217","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/09/1998 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Black triangle flying over with dim red lights at each corner.","Longitude":"-103.314695"}
