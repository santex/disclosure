{"Region":"Wisconsin","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt all started when i was at stanges park in Merrill,Wisconsin. I was sitting next to some bushes with one of my friends. Then all of a sudden I saw some weird oval shaped object flying across the sky at what seemed to be a low rate of speed considering it had a really low humming sound coming from it, but it might of sounded like that because it was going so fast. All i know is that I'm pretty damn sure it wasn't a plane, because what i heard was probably louder then a train. It sounded as loud as being right in front of a train when the whistle blows when it comes by, but a really low humming noise. I thought it would have been bigger then it looked cause it was so loud, but i guess not. I can also verify that there were red, white and blue lights flashing in an odd pattern that I saw the last time i sighted a UFO. I lost sight of the object when it got out of view behind the tree line."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Merrill","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/24/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.180522","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.180522,+-89.683459(13399)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13399) map </A>","Longitude":"-89.683459","Case Number":"13399","Date of the Event":"10/24/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Merrill","There were no other sightings in Merrill on or around October 24th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13399.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13399.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"I saw an oval shaped object moving across the sky very slowly and it was making a very low humming sound","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-10302008-0022"}
