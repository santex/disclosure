{"divs":["Sighting DetailsBack in 2004, my girlfriend and I were going to Walmart to finish up the kids Christmas shopping. She was driving and when we turned onto Court st I happened to look up at the expressway and noticed a large object in the sky and didn't really think much of it. When we got out of the car at Walmart we both noticed a very large rectangular black object with a bank of bright white lights covering the back of the craft. It Hovered silently above a neighborhood that is behind the store. I asked her if she sees that and her reply was a yes in a calm voice. We didn't stop to watch it for a few minutes or anything. We just kept walking. I'm not a crazy person or have mental issues but I honestly think that the white lights had some sort of control over our actions. I say this due to the simple fact that Walmart's parking lot is always packed at Christmas time and nobody was pointing it out to the other people in the parking lot."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Latitude":"43.022456","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"Was a passenger in a car and seen it over e-way. it ended up behind walmart over a neighborhood at a very low altitude","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Burton","There were no other sightings in Burton on or around December 14th 2004"],"Longitude":"-83.595416","City":"Burton","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.022456,+-83.595416(44429)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44429) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12092012-0018","Date of the Event":"12/14/2004 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"44429","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44429.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/09/2012 07:08 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"Other"}
