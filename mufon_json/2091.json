I first spotted the object in MilportNY. At that time the object was heading in a southerly direction. I lost sightof the object for quite a while. I was traveling at about 50 miles a hour andit was moving rapily away from me.When I got into Elmira NY, I spotted the object again over an appartment houselocated on Davis st. in Elmira. The object hovered over the building for a longtime. I heard no noise coming from the object. I would have to say that theobject was a grey to a darker color. The object was rounded in the rear andpointed at what I thought was the front. I only saw yellow and orange lights onthe object. It never moved from the last spot I saw it. I dove the rest of theway home wondering what it was that I had seen. I have used my uncles E-mail asI do not have a computer. However, he is willing to relay any questions thatyou may have to me."],"Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.089796,+-76.807734(2091)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2091) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"2091","Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Unknown hovering craft","City":"Elmira","Date of the Event":"01/20/2002 05:45 UTC","Longitude":"-76.807734","Date Submitted":"01/20/2002 05:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
