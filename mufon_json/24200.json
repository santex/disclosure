As we returned to our street, I looked up to catch what I thought were more fireworks. Except these four objects hovered overhead, didn't make any noise and didn't turn colors or lose their luster after a few seconds. I stopped to watch as the objects started to move east all at the same time. They kept the same direction and same speed for about a minute and then they sped up for a quick second and then continued at the slower speed until they were out of sight. The whole event was probably about 5 minutes long. All 4 objects were uniform in all of their motions... almost seeming like they were tied together."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.631462,+-75.364358(24200)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24200) map </A>","City":"Bethlehem","Longitude":"-75.364358","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"07/03/2010 09:15 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24200.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24200.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Bethlehem","There were no other sightings in Bethlehem on or around July 3rd 2010"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-07052010-0050"}
