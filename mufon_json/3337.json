Saw object suddenly appear between Orion and Little Dipper . Thought it might be a satellite but it was zigzagging and moved so fast that I had to try hard to follow it. Moved sporatically across sky heading north. Disappeared then reappeared. Sky VERY clear after rainfall. Appeared to be about satellite size from this far away. Could have covered it with an aspirin at that distance then it just disappeared . Whole thing happened in about 5-6 seconds. Was there anything reported in this area?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3337.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.766479,+-117.355274(3337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3337) map </A>","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-117.355274"}
