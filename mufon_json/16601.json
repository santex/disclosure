I did not see anything but felt that \"something\" was around me. I use a Nikon D50 with a 55-200mm zoom lens. This was the first time these \"kisses\" showed up in my photos. Since then they regularly appear in the same general area of the SE sky. Mostly the red one comes. I don't get any bad feelings from these UFOs I feel they are just observing me. Many times I will \"hear\" them in my minds ear calling me outside and I will go out and take some shots and they will be in them. I do not know what or who they are but I always smile when I see them. I wish I could see them with my eyes !!"],"Latitude":"39.749963","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16601.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16601_submitter_file1__ufohhhh.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16601_submitter_file2__DSC_0043.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16601_submitter_file3__DSC_0069.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16601.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.749963,+-75.541997(16601)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16601) map </A>","Longitude":"-75.541997"}
