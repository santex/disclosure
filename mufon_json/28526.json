She and I often look at the sky for objects. She noticed a spherical object flying fairly high in the sky. We both looked for strobe light which will often signify a plane at night. The object moved into our field of vision and I sent her inside to get her phone to take a picture. The photo did not come out, but we did see a plane about 2 or 3 minutes later about the same altitude with strobe lights. It gave us an estimate to how fast the other object was moving, which was considerably faster between parts of the big dipper. The object disappeared by continuing its flight in the same direction. The object did not move in any lateral fashion. I did not really feel anything, as I do believe in alien life. I would add it was kind of exciting to watch."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"42.007516","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28526.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28526.html"],"Summary":"Looking up an noticed object zipping across sky at night without red blue strobes.","Longitude":"-71.505414","Date of the Event":"04/03/2011 09:02 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Woonsocket","There were no other sightings in Woonsocket on or around April 3rd 2011"],"Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 01:04 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.007516,+-71.505414(28526)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28526) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO"}
