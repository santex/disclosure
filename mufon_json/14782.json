It was sometime ago, so I cannot remember the exact date. We were sitting looking at the stars and I thought I saw one move. I assumed it was just a my eyes playing a trick on me, but then one of my friends said he saw it as well, and the two others who were with me agreed that they too, were seeing it. As I focused more on it, I noticed that the object was somewhat oval shaped. It was almost directly aove us when we noticed it, seemingly higher up than typical jet liners fly. We watched as it moved in a mostly North to south direction. It moved slower than a shooting star but faster than a plane, and sooned passed out of sight. What seemed really odd about it was the manner in which it moved. It \"vibrated\" across the sky, reminding us of the way ants cross the ridges in a sidewalk, leading us to call it the Space Ant."]}
