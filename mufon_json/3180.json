We were outside looking at thesky because I told my family about the upcoming meteor shower to which we wereable to observe a couple of satellites flying overhead. I caught one and pointedit out to my 5 other family members outside with me. As we all looked at it, itgot really bright like someone pointing a spotlight into your eye. We were allstunned by this and very curious as to what it could have been. We all talkedabout how wierd it was but continued on with our night. This was at about 1100PM and lasted for about a minute. The object eventually faded out of sight. Mybrother who previously worked at Shreiver AFB in Colorado Springs flyingsatellites, said he was pretty sure that wasnt a satellite reflecting the sunback. I just found it very strange and thought I would report it."],"Region":"Colorado","Object Features":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3180.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/07/2004 11:00 UTC"}
