My boyfriend went outside on my porch to have a cigarette, as he always does. It was a starry night and he began looking at this (so called) star (disk like shape) that started spinning and turning weird colors. He ran in the house and got his digital camera. Took a video of this surprisingly star that was very entertaining. Spinning up and down and side to side and turning colors. Then it disappeared. Just dropped out of the sky. Anyone know what this is???"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Sanford","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16536.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16536_submitter_file2__ufoquestion.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16536.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/26/2009 08:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-04162009-0013"}
