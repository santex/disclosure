I picked him up at 9 p.m. We were in an intersection next to the Cedar Ridge School. We were leaving his work when my youngest son said, \"What is that?\" He pointed to the sky. We seen an object in the sky, pretty close. I can't say for sure, but probably about a mile away. Maybe not even that. It looked like a red orb, glowing like a flame. It was hovering and moving slowly across the sky. I wasn't able to continue looking at it since I was driving but my son said it started moving up and down and back and forth. We were not able to continue to follow it because we were in an intersection. So we lost site of the object. I asked my sons if they had ever seen anything like that. They said, \"No.\" We all described the same thing. This was definitely a UFO. We were all so shocked. My oldest son tried to take a picture, but it didn't turn out."],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Branson","There were no other sightings in Branson on or around June 21st 2012"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Branson, MO UFO sighted Looked like a fireball.","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/22/2012 07:02 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/21/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.645693,+-93.213414(39718)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39718) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39718.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39718.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
