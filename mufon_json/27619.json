I took a bunch of pictures, and was viewing them to add to our website today. This is the first time I noticed the anomaly in the upper right hand corner. I have a RAW version of this photo, quite large and unaltered in any way. This is the only photo where the object appears and I thought it interesting as it has motion blur and is in the distance. I did not see it at the time as I was focused on the subject, but it looks an awful lot to me like a moving oval object off in the distance - an airplane would not blur this way. I am a professional photographer."]}
