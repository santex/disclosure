The sunrise was spectacular, so I wound down my window and randomly took photos over my shoulder (iPhone 4s). Later that morning I uploaded one of the photos to facebook. I noticed an object in the photo... I reviewed the other photos and noticed that 6 of the frames had the same object in different positions of the frames.. the last 3 photos I took were stationary (waiting for lights to turn green at traffic lights)��� and they were taken 1 second apart from the meta data on the frames... You'll notice frames 492, 493 and 494 from the meta data were 1 second apart. There is no object in 492, 493 shows a faint object and 493 a clearer object.. I am a professional electronics engineer."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"115.861539","Date Submitted":"06/26/2012 09:41 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"Australia","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Perth","There was one other sighting in Perth on or around June 21st 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
