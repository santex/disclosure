{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving down South Hulen headed home when I saw these lights.I thought it was an Air plane but, after getting a closer look while it was floating across the sky It was maybe 600 to 700 feet in the air. But, what caught my attention was the positioning of the lights on the unknown craft. It had 3 solid white lights on each end and it was shaped like a triangle. In between the white lights appeared red flashing lights. It did not make any noise it just floated on by,I had never seen anything that moved like that without making any sound.I could'nt believe it. It shook me up.The craft was moving quickly and quietly through the sky.I lost visual after it went about 2 to 3 miles down the road headed east over highway 20. I lost sight of the craft after about 2 mins it had gone about 2 to 3 miles from my position."],"Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/03/2010 01:04 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Benbrook","There were no other sightings in Benbrook on or around September 3rd 2010"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"32.682688","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"25272","Summary":"I was driving down South Hulen home when I saw these lights I thought was an Air plane but, after getting a closer look.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25272.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-97.453036","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Benbrook","Log Number":"US-09032010-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.682688,+-97.453036(25272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25272) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/03/2010 02:55 UTC"}
