I have seen one other one in my life and have serval witness's to that one also. I lived in vernal utah for about 2 years when I was 12 and 13.Well there is an air force base there curiosly though as an adult I looked and there is no reference to it on military or civilian maps and is not registered as a base.But it is there none the less I ashure you the airmen use to drive by my house on the outskirts of town on there way to the base always waving at me and me waving back.If you took the road I lived on to where it ended it ended at the base and a guarded gate.We as kids would ride up the road to the gate and say hi to the guards who would give us candy sometimes or soda pop.Anyways one night around 1987 we were on my grandmas porch and saw 3 bright lights one on top of each other just hovering.They sat there for over a half hour they would blink dissapear and reappear.Right on top of each other 1 2 3 no sound what so ever they were so close I thought I could shoot one with my 22cal gun which dad promptly took from me and said no.Then the top one blinked dissapeared reappeared and shot straight up I mean straight up so fast that it left a streak of light as it did this.The second one did the same thing about a minute later.Then the third on dissappeared then reappeared and dropped something another light fell from the bottom of this object towards the ground and then it too shot straight up.The next day me and my dad went out in to the hills where we had seen these things.We were denied access there was a big fence that ran for miles that said goverment propety it was on the air force base.so we never found out what it was. thank you tim jacobson"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Cedar Rapids","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"8674","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Cedar Rapids","There were no other sightings in Cedar Rapids on or around August 11th 1999"],"Date of the Event":"08/11/1999 12:00 UTC"}
