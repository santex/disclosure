This object came over the trees at about the altitude of an airplane fromt he direction of the chanting. The object was a bright, yet dulled pale yellow. It was about the size of Jupiter and Venus joined together on their brightest luminescence. It flew from the west to the southeast. After the object went over the far horizon the chanting ceased within minutes. I don't know if the two are related but they seemed to coincide with each other and each seemed to stop with each other. I tried to check the field where I heard the chanting from and it was dark and empty. I also got the sense of presence from the object and along with the chanting seemed to cast a strong presence of unease."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
