There was an incoming plane in the spheres direction and as soon as the plane was close to it, it just dissapeared. I took video of it as best I could on my cell phones video. I thought at first it might be a chinese lantern or something but lanterns dont move like that. I thought about contacting the police but then I thought to myself, what if the police show up at my door and arrest me for prank calling the dept. I felt very weirded out by this. I surely hope someone else in the Florida Pinellas and Pasco county area saw this as well."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.209692,+-82.764492(41430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41430) map </A>","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Holiday","There were no other sightings in Holiday on or around August 4th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41430.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41430.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41430.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/04/2012 09:53 UTC","City":"Holiday","Country":"United States","Latitude":"28.209692","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-82.764492","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Log Number":"US-08042012-0028","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Summary":"I saw a bright orange sphere hovering for 2 mins until a plane was in its path and it dissapered"}
