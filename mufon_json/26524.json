Lately its bean getting a few shots I cant understand, I dont think this many planes would be in the same area at the same time. I have a ton of these pictures. and some are the same time each night. Not saying they are U.F.Os, just dont know what they could be. I also live about 17-20 miles from palm beach international airport. I would love to find out what it is, even if its nothing. thanks for your time."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.8221,+-80.047099(26524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26524) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"North Palm Beach","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26524_submitter_file2__JUPITERINLET.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26524_submitter_file3__WTF)).jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26524.html"],"Region":"Florida","Latitude":"26.8221","Longitude":"-80.047099","Date Submitted":"11/12/2010 08:24 UTC","Log Number":"US-11122010-0008","Disposition":"IFO"}
