(49th) i seen a white dog out side. he was big so i watched him a i walked passed. no steet lights so it was dark. and my feet were killing me. night air was hott. by time i was heading back i was tired. but as i passed this dog i seen a odd bright star i thought. didnt pay it much because i was just wanting to get home. and was sore. but i looked at it again. and didn't pay it mind and for some reason i stopped. and gave it a look. i seen the tree line and watched this star to see if it moved against the tree line and as i watched it moved about 6 feet across the sky. and stopped at this time i was like with is that!!! and watched it sit there and 3 other little points of light came down. (the sky was clear and many stars were out) but these came right to the star bright light that moved. once there the bigger one the star moved yet again to wrere it was the 1st time i seen it sitting. then the 3 followed it. they sat for bout 60 seconds. then the big star like light did a loop as big as a quarter. then sat for 10 seconds then all 4 went up into the sky. and kinda faded out. there was many stars in the sky this wasn't a starlight or a balloon. or a bird or venus. just a week before this me and my friend seen a black craft poping in and out of a cloud. over paylow food store on ridge rd, in Griffith in day light while going to car, and now i seen this. i have no clue what i seen."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"walking home","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.267194,+-86.134902(39350)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39350) map </A>"}
