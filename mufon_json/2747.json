Then after seeing the UFO. We were driving through dark area on I-10 east just past state line when we noticed two crafts hovering above the jeep. I believe it may have left residue or something on my front winshield. I noticed it when it was cold and wet the fog on the windshield revealed that there was a shape or drawing on the glass. I asked my friend if he had put something on it and he said no, I noticed that the picture on the windshield could have been an exact drawing of what I saw on Nov 14. My friend then pointed out there was a duplicate of the same thing on the passenger side of the winshield. We pulled over to examine it more closely and both agree that it was the same as what we saw. My friend seems to believe there is symbols or writing around the circles but It just looks like swiggles to me. however all of it is really symmetrical and it definitely was not drawn by hand it is too perfect. We rubbed to try and get it off the window but it won't come off."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
