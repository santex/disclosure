{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIN THE 1970'S WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE WAS LAUNCHING ALL KINDS OF MISSILES THAT WERE ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES & WORK ON ANTI-MISSILE MISSILES WITH NUCLEAR TIPPED WARHEADS DID EXIST... ME & MY FATHER CHARLES A 20 YEAR U.S. AIR FORCE AIRMAN WERE GETTING INTO HIS VW CAR ON A THURSDAY NIGHT AT ABOUT 9:30 PM THIS INTENSE FIREBALL INSTANTLY FLASHED DIRECTLY OVER HEAD & LOOKING ALL AROUND ME, UP & DOWN THE STREET IT WAS AS BRIGHT AS THE SUN AT HIGH NOON FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS!!!! THE LAS CRUCES NEWPAPER STATED AT THAT TIME \"INSTENSE FIREBALL LIGHTS UP ALL OF LAS CRUCES AS BRIGHT AS THE HIGH NOON SUN\"!!!! BUT NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY WAS OR IF IN FACT A ANTI-BALLISTIC NUCLEAR WARHEAD MISSILE WAS LAUNCHED & THE NUCLEAR WARHEAD WAS EXPLODED IN OUTER SPACE??? A OUTER SPACE NUCLEAR BLAST WOULD HAVE A INSTENSE FIRE-BALL FLASH BUT WOULD GO AWAY PRETTY FAST WITHOUT ANY SOUND OR NOISE OF THE BLAST... I WOULD VERY VERY MUCH LIKE TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT INSTENSE FIREBALL WAS ON THAT DARK WINTER NIGHT BACK IN THE 1970'S RIGHT HERE IN LAS CRUCES, NEW MEXICO????"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere","Date Submitted":"11/30/1973 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.32771,+-106.757554(18330)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18330) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"New Mexico","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Las Cruces","There were no other sightings in Las Cruces on or around November 30th 1973"],"Latitude":"32.32771","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18330","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07262009-0022","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/30/1973 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Las Cruces","Summary":"INTENSE BRIGHT FIREBALL AS BRIGHT AS MID-DAY SUN ! ! ! !","Longitude":"-106.757554","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18330.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18330.html"]}
