She reported this event to me, but she isn't one to report things like this publically. She rose early on the morning of 27 March, 2007. She was getting ready for work and letting the dogs outside. She was looking at the horizon line, just before sunrise. Across the sky came what looked a bit like a shooting star, but much larger. She said, from her perspective, that the object appeared as a broad streak across the sky, coloring from green to orange to yellow. A shooting star streaks across the sky, never seeming to land or hit the ground. My mother says this object appeared to land or crash, disappearing behind the treeline and out of sight. There was no sound of a crash - the whole event was silent. She became frightened, gathered the dogs, and went inside. She is unsure if what she saw was a \"UFO\" or merely a meteorite burning up as it sped through the atmosphere, but it's unusal coloring and it's perceived \"nearness\" to her property unsettled her."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.481782","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Longitude":"-72.681258","Log Number":"US-03282007-0005","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6677.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/27/2007 05:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"6677","Date of the Event":"03/27/2007 05:30 UTC","Summary":"Almost like a shooting star...","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Connecticut","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Durham"}
