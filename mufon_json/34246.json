It was a clear crisp night with a full moon and minimal cloud cover. I saw this bright light coming from the northwest out my passenger side car window. At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter, but the longer I watched the object the more it didn���t appear to be either. I decided I needed to pull over before I got into an accident, so I pulled into a restaurant parking lot. This object was a reddish orange sphere or ball of light traveling towards me at a medium pace. As I watched more of these spheres appeared until there was approximately 5 or 6 of these objects following each other evenly spaced apart. They moved following the same path making no noise, one at a time elevating into the sky, disappearing just south of me. I tried to get some other driver���s attention who were traveling down route 113 by jumping up and down pointing to the objects in the sky. This whole ordeal happened in about 1 minute or so, not a long time, so just a few cars passed. I am sure these people thought I was either a crazy man or drunk. Not sure if I was successful in getting any of the other driver���s attention, but if anyone did see these objects, make a report and submit to MUFON. Being a scientist I tried to rationalize what I saw, but couldn���t come up with any reasonable explanation except that these reddish orange spheres were UFO���s. Doing a little more online searching about UFO sightings, I came across a sighting on December 5, 2011 where several people reported seeing at least two UFOs in Allentown Pennsylvania the direction where these spheres were traveling from. I never thought in my life I would ever see something like this, it is something that you see on TV or have heard, but it is an experience I will never forget."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.346924,+-75.272167(34246)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34246) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12222011-0007","Latitude":"40.346924","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Silverdale","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Silverdale","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"12/10/2011 11:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34246.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34246.html"],"Summary":"On December 10, 2011 at 11:00 pm in Silverdale Pennsylvania.
