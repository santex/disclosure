They were not blinking, pink in color, did not veer off course, so were not flares or fireworks. They just kept rising up and up until they faded into the clouds. Best rationale was that they were police helicopters - there is the Killingsworth station in the general area they appeared to be from, but does portland even have 6 helicopters? and at less than 1.5 miles away, wouldn't I have heard 6 helicopters? and wouldn't the lights be blinking instead of constant? and how would they climb so high as to disappear on a relatively clear night....they rose slowly enough I had time to wake up girlfriend, she saw them as well. Wish I had thought to grab the cell phone camera."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.530322,+-122.666697(20136)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20136) map </A>","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were 3 other sightings in Portland on or around July 11th 2009"],"City":"Portland","Region":"Oregon","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.530322","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/11/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other"}
