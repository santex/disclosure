This is very close to Scottsdale airport. Through the trees I noticed a building twinkling but it was a very tall building. It occurred to me there is no building that tall. Then it was obvious. There were between 3-4 dozen amber (orange) solid individual lights moving silently West. No rotations, no blinking. Call them orbs but all bunched together. This was with in a quarter to half mile high in sky. The only thing to relate to this would be massive amounts of helicopters flying low but with that many choppers the noise would be deafening. This was totally silent. It crossed in front of us from Left to Right but moving in a pack to the West. I pulled over to get the video camera rolling but as soon as I pulled over the lights turned off one by one. It almost seemed like it was done because I pulled over. Quite a thrilling experience. This was at 825pm Friday."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
