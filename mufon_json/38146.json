Right after the sun set ( we were all taking pictures) my Wife says \"What are those?\" I looked up, as well as other people. We all saw 2 objects just sitting there. They were very reflective and slightly changed shape but DID NOT move. I said \"take photos now!!!!!!\" The objects stayed stationary, with 15-20 mph Gulf winds. They then, after 10-15 min started to \"phase out.\" That's all I can say to explain it, they just started disappearing......took about 30 secs to vanish. The one on the left appeared to jet upward right before it disappeared. Myself, my Wife and many other people were astonished by what we all saw......One guy said \"Now you don't see that everyday?\" I was just speechless......We have never seen unexplained objects ever."],"Case Number":"38146"}
