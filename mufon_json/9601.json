{"Region":"Oregon","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsHello Mufon, On Friday, February 15, 2008, at three o���clock in the afternoon, I saw an object in the sky over Eugene, Oregon. I was sitting on a patio at the time, in the downtown area of the city, having a late lunch. The day was slightly overcast, with only a thin layer of high altitude cirrus clouds, and it was very warm for February, about 55 degrees. I was thinking about how nice it was, and I happened to glance up to see if any rain clouds had formed. High overhead, and slightly to the east of me, I saw a small object that appeared to be at least a thousand feet above the ground. I���m judging it���s altitude mostly by the cloud cover. I know this particular type of cloud is always at least a thousand feet high, and the object was moving in and out of the scattered cloud cover, although it was never completely hidden by the clouds. The object was not large; it would have been covered by a golf ball held at arm���s length. But the detail was very clear. The object was brilliant white, and it appeared to shine with it���s own light source. It was round on top, and there was a flat area on the bottom. The flat area was slightly concave, like a crescent moon, waning past the half phase. Below that, there was a thin, bright filament of bright light. It looked like a string of pure light. At the end of this filament, there was a round light, switching in color from orange to green to bright white. This lower light would also disappear, as part of the cycle of color change. The lower light was moving in a circular pattern below the larger body, as if the filament of light were a string, and the lower light was being swung on it, in a slow circle. I have some training in astronomy, and I know that some satellites can be observed in daylight. I���m also familiar with how things look when they are in Low Earth Orbit. This object was not in orbit. It���s path across the sky was too slow. It appeared to hover, and it also moved very slowly from north east to south west. The winds aloft, judging by movement of the cloud cover, were easterly, and slow, maybe ten miles an hour, so the object was moving at almost ninety degrees to the direction of the wind. After about five minutes of observation, the object changed course. It did not speed up, but it began to move due east, in the same direction as the wind. It appeared to move more slowly than the wind, however; the clouds were passing it by. The object eventually just got too far away for me to see. The object was small, but it was not far away, being almost directly overhead when I sighted it. It was close enough that I could see small details. The upper portion was smooth and round. There were no ���flight surfaces��� anywhere on it. I have no idea what this could have been. I know that when I saw it, I was having a very pleasant moment. It had been a relaxing day. I���ve just moved Eugene, and I was thinking what a nice place it was, and I was having one of those rare moments when there are no worries and no stress. My mind was open and at ease. I thought about running inside to ask someone to look at the object with me, but they are all strangers to me, and I have to admit I was embarrassed to ask a roomful of strangers to ���come look at the UFO out here.��� Later in the day, I called a friend, and told her all about it. She���s interested in UFO���s and has had a close encounter. Then my sister called. During our conversation, I said, ���hey, I saw������ and the phone went dead at that instant. She called back, and I did not mention the UFO further. The phone connection was perfect for the rest of our thirty minute conversation. This object had the ���strangeness��� that so many people talk about when they have a sighting. It was entirely real, and yet it also seemed to be ���not completely here��� in some way. Thanks for listening. You may contact me with questions if you like."],"Summary":"Saw very strange object over dowtown. crescent, light filament attached, swinging light below, circling, attached to filament","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There were no other sightings in Eugene on or around February 15th 2008"],"Latitude":"44.055599","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-123.078644","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Eugene","Log Number":"US-02152008-0006","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/15/2008 03:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9601.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9601.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.055599,+-123.078644(9601)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9601) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9601","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/15/2008 03:30 UTC"}
