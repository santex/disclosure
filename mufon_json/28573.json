Upon watching it, it illuminated very brightly within 8 seconds and went star-like again. About 10 seconds later it illuminated again. Like it knew I was watching it pass... I say they're common type because, it's happened time and time again... But not every night. Some people think from my description they're satellites, well they're not. These have flown under 500 ft and have flown far under 100 ft... That time it was almost direct contact... They appear like spheres of light when close. Many strange things have happened other then that but I'm still not sure if it's a secret human operation or it's something entirely else. Maybe in time I'll discover the undeniable truth. PS. There is a military installation just outside the city. There was a regular jet aircraft making it across the sky before the sighting. The aircraft was heading west while the UFO was heading north."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Common star-like object heading North, illuminated a few times"}
