The field lays longer north and south and my truck was facing east in the middle. It was late in the evening but the sun was not down. I looked toward the north just above the tree line which would be about 30 or more degrees up. When I spotted something which factoring in the distance was quit large and somewhat square it glowed red or reddish orange maybe the sun was reflecting off it? We watched it for a few seconds then it seemed to fold in on itself like when you take note book paper and fold it in half then in half again and again and it disapered. All of us seen it except my youngest son. It didn't move across the sky nor did we hear any sound. A couple of weeks later I was telling one of my friends who lives a couple of miles south east of me about seeing it. And he told me he also saw it with the same discription except to him it seemed to fade out."],"City":"Naylor","Log Number":"US-09292007-0005"}
