{"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron, Triangle","divs":["sighting detailsthis could be classified as old news, but i feel that i at least need you to know about it. this is about 2 seperate sightings in 2 different geografical locations. the common denomiter, being the size and shape. one sighting in broad day light and the other at a predawn hour. the one in indiana first; this was a bright and sunny day for the most part. my spouse and i were returning from an outing at a reservoir known as misenewah, i believe is the spelling, east of peru. friends gathered there for a typical day, but the weather was cool and the outing was ended early. my wife and i were in route back to kokomo, in. where we lived and i worked. in the fall the crops were gathered and corn stalks had been chopped down, revealing flat farm country. the road we were on passed by these fields, and we were traveling in an easterly direction. we were just enjoying the day and the country side as in lay, just before severe winter weather set in. out of nowhere, a very large shadow passed over us, slowly, traveling in the same direction that we were traveling. we were traveling at aproximately 35-40 mph and slowed as we observed what had just passed overhead. we were shocked at the least and awed at what we had just seen. i remember 2, but my wife says 3 craft flying in formation, at an altitude of aproximately 30 feet. rather than gaze upon the 3 craft, i homed in on the one closest to us to note as much as i could about it. what struck me the most was how something this big, could stay airborn at this slow speed. it was delta shaped, drab colored, width at widest point somewhere around 60 feet. there was absolutely no noise or turbulance being generated. this seemed odd at this low altitude. i noticed no markings of any kind. also, i was taken back at the size of a large rectangular opening at the rear of the craft. the opening was about 1\\4 the total width of the craft and almost he same heigth as the thickness of the craft. i noticed no tail fins. we slowed to a crawl as we observed they continued in an easterly direction, in an aproximate direction of grissom afb. we observed them till they were out of sight; the duration lasting some minutes. what has stuck in my head was the size, the shape, absense of noised and turbulance at this close proximity to the ground, and how they stayed in the air at this slow speed. they were close enough that the nearest one could almost be touched. the second sighting preceeded this one, was in either the late 70's or early 80's, and was in a different part of the country. i worked in a steel mill in birmingham, alabama, and my starting time was 6:30 a.m. as i lived some distance feom my work, it required me to leave early in the morning hours to arrive there on time. the sighting was in an area close to the garden city exit on i 65. there was not a lot of traffic due to the hour. i topped a small hill,headed south, droped into a dip and ran under something. i noticed an 18 wheeler at the same time running under it also, headed north, at the same time. there were dim lights shinning down. the shape that i noticed, although it was dark, beyond the lights was again delta or triangular shaped. it was about 50 feet from the ground when we ran under it in opposite directions. again, no noise, no turbulance. as the 18 wheeler and i topped the hills on both sides of the dip, in opposite directions, we stopped and observed the craft. it rose about 1000 feet, rotated about 90 degrees, and disappeared faster than you could blink an eye, in an easterly direction. the acceleration from dead still to out of sight in less than a second or two shocked me. the truck driver and i conversed on cb radios to verify what we had just seen. i have only spoken with few people about this, as i dont want to be lumped into a group that people think are nuts. i have seen other phenominom such as fire balls following power lines, fox fires, aurora borealis, and the like. what i have seen resembled none of this. it was real and exists. there is something deffinitely out there. for whatever it's worth, i hope that this aids you in some part."],"Object Features":"None, Wings","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/15/1985 03:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Peru","There were no other sightings in Peru on or around October 15th 1985"],"Log Number":"US-07142007-0003","Date of the Event":"10/15/1985 03:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"40.761133","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.761133,+-86.061471(7436)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7436) map </A>","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Windy","Country":"United States","Summary":"returning from an outing with friends","Longitude":"-86.061471","City":"Peru","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7436.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7436.html"],"Case Number":"7436"}
