I usually cut across my neighbor's lawn, but this time before I could leave my driveway, I noticed a humongous triangle (upright) hovering over the area. I froze. It did not move. There was no noise. It was glowing a dull green. I stared at it at last 10 minutes. I was afraid to move,ago to the house and get a camera. I finally turned to go get it, but as soon as I did it vanished with no noise or anything"],"Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"03/31/1983 12:00 UTC"}
