Its flight path was sporadic as it initially flew North to South and then stopped dead in its tracks, from memory i think it then shot towards a S Westerly direction, stopped and the navigated to the East, stopped one last time and then disapeared towards the N East. A couple of minutes later three or four black helicopters crossed over the Pennines from the original direction of the craft. The craft was black and circular shaped. I was wondering if anybody else remembers this occurence? Please bear in mind that i may be out with the year."],"Case Number":"24441","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Manchester","There were no other sightings in Manchester on or around July 17th 1984"],"Longitude":"-2.240616","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.482641,+-2.240616(24441)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24441) map </A>","Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United Kingdom","Region":"England","Log Number":"GB-07112010-0020","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/11/2010 05:01 UTC"}
