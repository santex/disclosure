{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband, daughter, 2 sons and myself were driving down the road (i was front seat passenger) from my daughters softball game. I was looking out the side window and saw something bright shiny silver in the sky, it looked like when the sun shines off of metal. I noticed an airplane flying above it and one to the side (they both had the trail of white behind them) but i did not see any lights or smoke near the silvery object. I told my husband to look in the direction i was looking underneath where the airplane was to see if he could see what i was seeing. He and my daughter both looked and saw it. I then asked him what it could be and he stated he's never seen anything like it. It appeared to remain stationary in the sky (not near the ground) for about 5 minutes then when i blinked my eyes it was gone. I did notice i was seeing what appeared to be spots as if i was staring into a bright light. We were only several miles from Fort Leavenworth Army base and it was a clear day."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.972293,+-91.822813(23298)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23298) map </A>","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-91.822813","Object Features":"Dome","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Shiny silver object hovering in one spot, daylight no clouds 2 airplanes nearby.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"05/15/2010 03:58 UTC","Case Number":"23298","Region":"Missouri","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"37.972293","Log Number":"US-05152010-0021","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23298.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23298.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/13/2010 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Sphere","Source":"MUFON"}
