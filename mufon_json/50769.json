I went outside to see what he had observed. A shiny domed craft was observed in 100 percent visibility skies flying South at an undetermined altitude. No sound, no vapor trail. The craft proceeded in a South Direction, then disappeared completely and instantly. There was no where for it to go, and there were no other craft visible in the sky at that time. The sky was blue with no clouds visible. At first I thought it might be an aircraft that had already gone by, but there was no vapor trail and no noise, there also were no wings visible. Speed was undetermined, but not real fast."],"City":"Jonesville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/12/2013 10:29 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50769.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50769.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"36.627102","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-83.197366","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09122013-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.627102,+-83.197366(50769)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50769) map </A>"}
