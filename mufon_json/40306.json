Observation location is near the corner of FM 2407 and Garden Drive in Atascosa County, Texas. At 9:58 PM I was scanning the Southern sky (where most of the nightly activity take place) when I noticed a familure star like object enter Earth's atmosphere from the north up at a 75 degree angle and to my East. Like I have witnessed before, when I first noticed the star light object, it is traveling in a southbound flight path from the north and when it enters the Earth atmosphere, it turns into a very bright and expanding light. The star like object looks like it makes an impact explosion into our atmosphere and its size and brightness enlarges to the size of my close fist at arm's length. As before, there is no sound during this event. In addition, this star like object enters right over the southern San Antonio to Laredo commercial airliner���s corridor. It is masking their Earth's entry into known FAA's flight paths, which is a very clever way to hide their descent. After the object enters our atmosphere, it returns to the size of a star and continues its southbound flight path into the distant horizon and out of my sight. I do not think it is a common satellite for the impact should have destroyed it. The full moon rises from the east and I end this night's observation."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.082109,+-98.748099(40306)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40306) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40306.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40306.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/05/2012 09:58 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Poteet","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"29.082109","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
