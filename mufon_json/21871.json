Its still there now but not for sale. Enter the address and then click on the pop up box. Then click on the Birds eye view and map then to street view option. Go to the right of the white house with a car and truck and to the trees between that house and house on right. There is an orange disc shaped object in the trees and a line of white smoke going straight up. If you then go back to the white house and double click on the floating box and then pan up the white smoke and orange disc and a funny cloud are right above the house. These homes are directly in front of a huge cemetary that is up the hill behind them. just wondering what it is.
