(the thought that it could be a developmental craft came to mind but then i thought who in their right mind would fly 2 prototypes at once over a densely populated area. we constantly see helicopters, private & commercial planes flying in the skies.) these objects were not like anything i\\we had seen before."],"Longitude":"-119.409782","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/22/2013 12:00 UTC"}
