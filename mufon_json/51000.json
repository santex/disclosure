{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was riding in the car on a dark back road with my boyfriend and we noticed a very bright light. We thought it might be a star at first but noticed it was way to low to be a star. So he stopped the car and we got out to get a better look. It was moving from side to side, back and forth, and changing shape at the same time. Then it seemed to be moving toward where we were standing. My boyfriend is always looking at UFO videos and claiming to see them around here so he was in absolute awe. He just standing there and watched it. I've never seen anything like this in person so it really really scared me. I jumped into the car and told him I wanted to go. It was getting closer and closer and I just kept screaming \"Let's Go! Let's Go! Let's Go!\" I honestly was near tears because I was so scared. My boyfriend drove towards the city and we still saw it in the sky hovering. We lost sight of it because we stopped looking. There are too many trees where we live to be able to see it."],"Longitude":"-92.138224","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09232013-0005","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.247083,+-92.138224(51000)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51000) map </A>","Region":"Louisiana","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Cone, Disc, Oval","Object Features":"None, Other","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Riding in car and saw a very bright light that looked like a star.","Date Submitted":"09/23/2013 05:24 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"31.247083","Date of the Event":"09/22/2013 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"51000","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51000.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51000.html"],"Tags":"City"}
