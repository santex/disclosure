WE COULDNT TELL WHAT THEY WERER SAYING IT WAS SOME TYPE OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. I THINK THEY THREATENED TO KILL US IF WE DIDNT TAKE THEM TO OUR LEADER. MY FRIED STANLEY WAS FREAKING OUT SO HE PUNCHED THE TWO ALIENS IN THE FACE AND PRESSED THE BUTTON TO SEND US BACK OUT OF THE SHIP AFTER THAT WE ALL WERE FREAKED OUT AND WENT HOME AND TOLD OUR OTHER FRIENDS ABOUT IT."]}
