As I was star gazing I noticed a V shaped, or boomerang shaped craft. The craft looked like it had two gigantic wings. On each wing were three lights and one light where the wings joined together. The lights were orange with a splash of yellow. The craft was moving slowly in a north western direction and there was no sound. The interesting thing was that there was an airplane flying considerably lower than the craft, somewhere around the neighborhood of 20,000-30,000 feet. The craft was at least 20,000 feet higher or more than the airplane. So in comparison to the height of the airplane and the height of the craft, my feeling was that the craft way bigger than the airplane. The craft then slowly flew out of my vision and I was excited as a 7-year-old on Christmas morning."],"Object Features":"Wings","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.63049,+-122.411084(46170)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46170) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Boomerang shaped UFO in the skies of San Mateo on March 10, 2013."}
