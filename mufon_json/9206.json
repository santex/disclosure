I sat up with my feet on the floor and saw 3 men standing in my bedroom with dark shades. I don't know why I wasn't afraid but I got up walked over to them and asked them what they were doing. There was a huge hole in my floor and they were looking down in it. There was very bright light and sounds of people working..... One of them said they were looking for \"fuel for our craft\". After I told them to tell me what it is I may be able to help. He said the word antimony and showed me a picture of it on a surface (telepathic). It was a solid irregular shaped substance with the broken edges looking like sand, granular..... I told them I didn't know what that is and looked over at my bed to see if I was alive or dead. When I looked back the men and the hole were gone..... My granddaughter asked me later who was I talking to last night..... After the men left I used the restroom and sat on my bed till the alarm went off trying to think about what had happened.....\""],"Longitude":"-99.729634","Log Number":"US-01242008-0006","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.450776","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","City":"Abilene","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/03/2007 01:00 UTC"}
