My girlfriend was looking at the moon and I sawthis small silver object. She call me outside where we observed it moving in astraight line until it was obscured by trees. It was a distant silver disk, butvery small. We would not have seen it unless observing the moon at that moment.It did not appear to be an aircraft of any type. We live near a major airportand an airbase. We never observer aircraft overhead except small private craft. It was not a baloon, as it traveled in a straight line at a constant speed. Iwould have to imagine that this craft was large at an extreme altitude, inexcess of 40,000. There were no contrails. In addition, the following night, perhaps, an hour later we saw a point of lightabout the same size. It was traveling North to South directly overhead. Again,we never see community or military traffic overhead."],"Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"05/21/2002 05:56 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"1692","City":"Tampa","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.452178","Latitude":"27.952235","Summary":"High Altitude Silver Disk. 19:56 5/21/02 Over Sout","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1692.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1692.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
