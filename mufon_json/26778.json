Thing that got me the most and which made it unique was a couple of things 1- the emmence speed 2- the very low altitude 3- was bee lining straight across the sky but at an abnormal hieght for it to be so straight 4- what it did at the very end, flying erratically and then the upward swooping motion it made before disappearing. Was extremely bright orange and red. See alot of shooting stars up hear but never so orange before and so low."],"Summary":"Misterious fireball-object","Longitude":"-74.44598","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/28/2010 05:56 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26778.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26778.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/26/0001 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.397303,+-74.44598(26778)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26778) map </A>","Latitude":"42.397303","Log Number":"US-11282010-0012","City":"Gilboa","Case Number":"26778","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
