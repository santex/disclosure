I looked and at this point there was an orange glowing sphere in the distance flying straight up from the horizon. At first it made me think that it was a rocket ship taking off in a far distance but there wasn't a trail behind it and we do not live beside any government or privately owned space centers that I know of. My girlfriend is beyond excited, yelling \"What is it? What is it?\" and I do not respond out of disbelief of my eyes. Moving slowly, it eventually turns into an oblong teardrop shape. We both watched as it ascended into the sky and eventually disappeared."],"Date Submitted":"08/22/2013 01:13 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Mississippi","Log Number":"US-08222013-0002","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-90.008702","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50053.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50053.html"],"Summary":"Flaming ball of light appeared over treeline slowly ascending and eventually turned into an oblong like shape and disappeared","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hernando","There were no other sightings in Hernando on or around August 20th 2013"],"City":"Hernando"}
