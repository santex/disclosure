Raalizing it was out of the ordinary I went inside to get my cell phone to take a picture. When I took the 1st picture it dimmed a little. I then went to take the 2nd picture and it zoomed off to the east and went out of sight. I live near the municipal airport but have never seen an airplane or helicopter like this or do what this one did. I did not see any blinking colored lights like I normally see on aircraft. I told a friend at work and he suggested I report this to MUFON. I was unable to download the pics from my phone but will have them later if needed. Thank you."],"Log Number":"US-09192009-0017","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.888552","City":"Casa Grande","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Casa Grande","There were no other sightings in Casa Grande on or around September 15th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"09/15/2009 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 06:18 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Summary":"Bright star like light to the north stationarly several min then took off to the east.","Case Number":"19400","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path"}
