We then noticed that it was being followed by a dimmer and smaller light at the exact same speed. This was in the southwest sky and the lights were traveling from west to east. At first I thought it might be a couple of planes, since the airport is east of where we were, except that they had no flashing lights and were traveling faster and at a higher altitude than any planes I had seen before. I then thought it could be the space shuttle but why would there be a second light? The lights continued east until they faded out, presumably into some clouds. The whole event lasted a little less than one minute. Both my friend and I tried for a good ten minutes to figure out what we had just seen but were left scratching our heads. If anyone has an explanation for this I would really like to know!"],"Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other"}
