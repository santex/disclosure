IT WAS A COLD, CLEAR NIGHT AND I WAS PROCEEDING DOWN A WINDY COUNTRY ROAD WHEN I NOTICED 4 BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHTS AT ABOUT 2,000 FT ELEVATION, PACING THE SPEED OF MY CAR AT ABOUT 45 MPH, OFF TO MY LEFT. I ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOW BUT DIDN'T HEAR ANY SOUND. I INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT IT MUST BE A HELICOPTER. I PULLED OVER AT THE NEAREST DRIVEWAY AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR. THE OBJECT CONTINUED MOVING NORTH FOR ABOUT A HALF MILE, STOPPED, TURNED AROUND ON A DIME AND DISAPPEARED IN AN INSTANT. NO CRAFT THAT I WAS AWARE OF COULD FLY AT SUCH A SLOW SPEED WITHOUT MAKING A LOT OF NOISE. THE LIGHTS DID NOT FLASH OR BLINK; THEY WERE CONSTANT WITH THE LEADING LIGHT SEEMING BRIGHTER THAN THE TRAILING 3 LIGHTS. YEARS LATER, I SAW A REPORT OF AN INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN BELGIUM IN WHICH THE CRAFT SEEMED VERY SIMILAR."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4484.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4484.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.413932","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"ONLY SAW 4 LIGHTS DEFINING A TRIANGULAR SHAPE","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/11/1980 11:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.413932,+-73.303482(4484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4484) map </A>","Tags":"City"}
