We had been watching the news about Princess Di's death. We went outside to say goodnight when I felt the urge to look up. All of us saw four small dim lights on a 45-degree angle (approximately), traveling at a very high rate of speed going north to south. There was no sound at all. It took less than three seconds or so to travel out of our sight. I am quite up to date on current military aircraft. It is my opinion that this was a test aircraft of some sort. However at that rate of speed it would have been going faster than mach 10. Guessing that it was flying between 10,000 and 70,000 feet above sea level this is a conservative estimate on its speed. I have never seen a satellite travel even close to this rate of speed and given the fact that they are hundreds of miles up this is the best educated guess I can come up with as to its altitude and speed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3679.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3679.html"],"Longitude":"-111.658534","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/07/1997 09:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"09/07/1997 09:00 UTC","City":"Provo","Log Number":"US-08022005-0025","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Provo","There were no other sightings in Provo on or around September 7th 1997"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
