I looked at it closely with a 9X rifle scope for 20 minutes and made my girlfriend look at it when she came home. Tried to call someone (you guys) to see if anyone might be dispatched to video tape it since it's still there. Filled out your report. Hope someone else filmed it. It was very clearly not a star, airplane, or helicopter. It's midnight now and still there. Over an hour of opportunity for someone to get some pretty clear images! Its position from my deck, which faces generally ESE, is almost directly in a line towards the ground from Orion's belt."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Thorndale","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.999022,+-75.76716(43899)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43899) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43899.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43899.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/14/2012 12:02 UTC","Summary":"Very brilliant glimmering lights of all colors coming from a stationary object.","Longitude":"-75.76716","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11142012-0001","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"39.999022","City":"Thorndale","Case Number":"43899","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
