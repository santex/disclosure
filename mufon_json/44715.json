Just when it got dark I was standing outside IHOP. I looked up and saw what looked like a plane coming head-on with me, as the white light being the size of a planes seemed to be still. Then it gets about 12 times bigger, as a white round light. Then it let's go of another light exactly like it where the light it seemingly made traveled about 20 feet then stopped and hovered. The first light then showed a horizontal row of colored small lights totaling 9. They pulsated twice then disappeared, as the original white light pulsated twice. Then it slowly goes to the other white light becoming one with it again. It hovered then flung out and disappeared into outer space at a high speed. The sky folded in around it, as it departed. The next morning I found an one inch long scratch mark on my right leg."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:10","Case Number":"44715","Date Submitted":"12/22/2012 01:35 UTC","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-12222012-0006","Date of the Event":"12/16/2012 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.796291,+-117.959198(44715)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44715) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
