The craft made no noise and was moving at a slower rate then usual aircraft. After we saw it 2 helicopters flew over head in the same direction as the craft. Not sure what it was but hopefully someone can shed some light. The event happens on dec. 19 2012. The shape of the craft was a triangle with three red lights at each point with a white smaller light that moved around the craft. It made no noise. I did capture a small video clip with my phone but it only shows the craft for a brief moment as I was to busy looking at the craft with my eyes and not with my camera on my phone. The sound in the video is our trucks engine not the craft. Sorry for the extreMly low quality."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around December 19th 2012"],"Longitude":"-84.903278","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/19/2012 09:59 UTC","City":"Portland","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Case Number":"44664","Log Number":"US-12192012-0020","Summary":"Witnessed while driving.flew east then looped west hovered over highway","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"12/19/2012 07:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.871711,+-84.903278(44664)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44664) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
