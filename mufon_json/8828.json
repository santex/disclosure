After a few minutes she opened the door and asked me to step out and look at something. She said \"what is that?\" I saw lights in the sky and I said \"those are just search lights from the airport.\" But after watching for a few minutes I realized they weren't shining on the clouds but from behind them. About ten lights (very large) doing circles and converging doing figure eights. They would shoot off leaving about five lights behind doing a lovely dance in the sky. I called my brother to tell him what we were watching and he asked me if we had a video camera. I hadn't thought of that. My wife got our camera and I shot a few minutes of video. The lights left, leaving only about three and then they too moved away. We watched the video and it came out pretty clear. Our camera is older and not digital but I'm going to copy it to DVD. It was very cool and I'm looking for a good explanation."],"Date Submitted":"01/11/2008 09:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Albany","Object Flight Path":"Other","Region":"Georgia","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
