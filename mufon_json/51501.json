I was taking a mud road home and I stopped to go to the bathroom. 2. About a year ago I was taking this same road at night and I saw something i couldn't explain. So now I randomly take this road just hoping to witness something again and get a photo. So when i stepped out of the truck I was looking around while I was going to the bathroom and off to the west there was this bright pulsating light. 3. A huge star or falling star. 4. It kind of flickered and pulsated. It stayed around the same area pulsating. It kind of looked like it was changing colors slightly but when i got home and zoomed in on the pictures you can really see the object was changing colors. 5. I was very nervous, very uneasy but very curious and really wanting proof. I got really nervous when i started to drive off and it seemed to follow me but continued to stay on my west side. 6. It continued to follow me but staying on my west side. When i turned and headed east and got close to hwy 75 it just disappeared."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wetmore","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Unknown Object","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like, Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/13/2013 12:12 UTC","City":"Wetmore"}
