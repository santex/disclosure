I took a picture with my digital camera and when I zoomed in to the object it was not a star. I took a second picture thinking something might have been on my lens. The object appeared again except the shape was slightly different. It seemed to have moved around a bit. It looked like a gold metal object with legs. My husband said it reminded him of a chandelier. It had to be very large because the full moon did not drown it out. We watched it for about 15 minutes and then went inside the house because it was very cold. I don't know how long it was up there. I would appreciate any information as to what this object might be."],"Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"star like object seen near full moon. Photo shows it's not a star.
