I pointed it out to the two with me and they began to track its odd movements.... it would get brighter... move left and right up and down and a few occasions appeared to move circularly... we noticed it together and all verbally recognized it and so my sister inquired if it recognized us.... at that time the object appeared to move closer enough to see there was not just one light but what appeared to be 3 lights possible 4 that were white and one in the corner that was red....we could almost make out a shape of the arrangements of lights to be almost pod-like sections containing a light per section.... once we had tracked it and gazed in amazement what we were seeing I ran into get my video camera (which of course had no tape in it) and my sister grabbed her small camera and started taping.... it almost seemed that once we got the camera other lights began to appear around the sky with similar movements and right at this time the clouds were increasing very rapidly... the object we originally tracked appears to dissipate into a cloud .... reappearing under the clouds and then behind them... I ran inside again to get my daughter and wife to see if they wanted to see a real life UFO and they came out.... my wife viewed it for about 2 minutes but I dont think my daughter saw much she's 5. They hung out for a few minutes and had to go back inside so I walked them back.....as I returned back outside i could not see my cousin and sister, they seemed to be in darkness, then out of darkness they ran toward me freaking out saying that a beam of light came toward them , my cousin claims he had an image or message delivered to his brain... I know far out Im not sure I can believe that one myself but thats what he claims and after what I saw I wasnt about to argue.They also said they had seen a flash of lightning with no thunder.... I myself had heard strange thunder sounds throughout the clouding event.... We three stayed outside while it was clouding to see either the one object appearing in multiple places in the sky in and out of clouds or multiple objects doing the same... at one time I know I saw at least 3 different lights with the same characteristics of the first object we tracked... My two witnesses were getting fairly excited about the whole ordeal so I constantly reminded them to stay spiritually focused on Christ and not get overly excited... mainly because I have had one very close encounter (a few hundred feet) from an unidentified light dance followed by 5 miles of following me in the late 90's.... just a few weeks ago I saw a UFO and reported it to you guys in the same area..... I dont know what else to say except for almost 50 minutes to an hour we watched lights all around our sky moving in and out of visibility.... disappearing in clear sky ... reappear in cloud sky it was crazy..."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/15/2010 09:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23636.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23636.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.101126","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Kansas City","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Summary":"3 eyewitnesses teased by multiple objects","Case Number":"23636","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There was one other sighting in Kansas City on or around May 15th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-06062010-0003","Longitude":"-94.576147"}
