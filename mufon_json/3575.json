THE DAD SAID, \"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\" I DOUBTED HIS COMMENT BUT SAW A QUARTER SIZED FIREBALL TO THE RIGHT WAY UP IN THE SKY. THE FLAME LASTED ONLY A MINUTE AND THE SKY WAS JUST GETTING DARK. AFTER A MOMENT A LIGHT WAS VISIBLE NEAR THE FLAME. IT WASN'T VERY BRIGHT AND I WOULDN'T OF NOTICED IT EXCEPT I STAYED ON THE FLAME THE WHOLE TIME. A CIRCULAR \"ORB\" WAS VISIBLE THE SIZE OF A PENCIL ERASER. AS IT GOT DARKER, FIVE LIGHTS WERE VISIBLE AROUND THE BALL AND HAD A FIXED PATTERN, ALMOST LIKE A PENTAGON. IF THE LIGHTS WERE FIXED AND CONNECTED TO THE CENTER LIGHT, THE OBJECT WAS HUGE. IT WAS GETTING CLOSER FROM THE ORIGINAL FLAME, BUT VERY FAR AWAY STILL. THE WHOLE OBJECT INCLUDING THE LIGHTS AROUND IT WAS TENNIS BALL SIZED. THE OBJECT WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY AND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A METEOR OR COMET. IT DEFINETLY ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE AND MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LARGE. WE FOLLOWED THE OBJECT UNTIL IT DISAPEARED OVER THE HORIZON. I RAN HOME AND TOLD MY PARENTS AND WATCHED THE SKY EVER SINCE.
