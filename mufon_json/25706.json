Being a MUFON field investigator, I frequently check the skies for unusual objects. This object was moving very slowly with no sound and had no observable navigation lights or wings. The siding was at sunset that the object was high enough to be in sunlight. The object appeared to be a double sphere with a mirror like metallic surface. It was at about 30��� from the horizon just above the trees behind my house. I observed the object for about 30 seconds trying to determine what it was and could not. I ran for my house which was about 100 yards away to retrieve my video camera, but when I returned the object had disappeared. It first appeared about 10 miles east of pinnacle Mountain heading directly toward the city of Little Rock. If it continued on its course it would have passed over the city of Little Rock very shortly after 7 PM. The only thing that I can think of other than a UFO that might have presented itself in this manner would be two mylar balloons. There was no surface wind to make the balloons move, but I have no idea if there were wins at altitude. I had no reference points for determining altitude, distance, or size. I had no reaction to the object other than surprise."],"Region":"Arkansas","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"25706","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.866756,+-92.404322(25706)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25706) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25706.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25706.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/05/2010 07:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"I double sphere with a mirror like metallic surface","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Maumelle","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None"}
