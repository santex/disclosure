The object with a steady white light flew much faster than a jet would fly, and although it screeched across the the background quickly, it changed trajectory at least twice during the flight across the screen. No trail was visible. There were several other helicopters with blinking lights flying much slower to give perspective of the night sky during the interview. The show will repeat again at 1:00am est, 12:00midnight if anyone would like to take a look."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
