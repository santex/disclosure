'rod' 2 is much more prominent because it is in the open sky to the right of 'rod' 1. both 'rods' appear to be on the same projectory from the left to the right of the picture. equipment used: nikon d5000 (70 mm - 1\\25 sec. - iso 250 - f\\4.5 - shutter priority) tony surace"],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Chesapeake","There were no other sightings in Chesapeake on or around January 27th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-76.456704","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Log Number":"US-01302012-0021","Latitude":"36.772852","Date of the Event":"01/27/2012 06:44 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Taking pictures of Sunset..
