We went back the next night to get pictures to see if it might be their.It was in approximate area.We took pictures,but none would show up. This object was large as a house.It has been seen since many times and may still be in area. I don't think it's military,but i don't know what it is."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Manor","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"31.103824","Case Number":"15007","Longitude":"-82.573194","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Triangle","Date of the Event":"11/14/2007 07:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.103824,+-82.573194(15007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15007) map </A>","Summary":"Fireball ,sphere and triangle","Disposition":"Hoax","Log Number":"US-01202009-0002","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
