It look sold dimond, or triangle shape 10 - 15 miles twards the south of me. I pulled my car over, by that time it covered the total horizon, at it's hight it had to coverhundreds of miles in a few seconds. Two minites later I saw one plane going north-east at 3,000 to 5,000 feet. it was out of sight before I could get my cell phone out for a pic. The wholr thing was less than 15 seconds. No plane can cover that amount of space. I lost it by distance not the horizon. I was on my way home after shopping and looking at the moon and planets when I noticed this movingaway from my direction. I never saw anything like this before. When I got home at 6:12PM I had two cell phones with me and one said I had 2 calls, but my phone didn't ring."],"Summary":"about same hight as moon at 6:02PM, nothing else in the sky near it","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45184.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45184.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Mundelein","There was one other sighting in Mundelein on or around January 13th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Mundelein"}
