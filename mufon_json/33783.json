{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi woke up in the middle of the night. something made me look out my window. my yard is very dark as i am back up to the mountains so there is never any light behind my house or in my yard. i couldn't take my eyes off of these white lights that were all over the trees on the one side of my yard. at first i thought -is the moon really bright tonight and somehow it leaving a reflection off of maybe a moist tree. the lights were very beautiful and still. it scared me so instead of looking out the window and up in the sky i closed my eyes and went back to sleep. i really didn't know what to think and forgot about it until this evening while watching a show on ufo's. maybe i saw something."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33783.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33783.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-118.765525","Date Submitted":"12/02/2011 10:56 UTC","Log Number":"US-12022011-0019","Tags":"City","City":"Oak Park","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/03/2011 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.200646,+-118.765525(33783)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33783) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Latitude":"34.200646","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"very bright lights in the trees of my yard","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"33783","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Oak Park","There were no other sightings in Oak Park on or around March 3rd 2011"]}
