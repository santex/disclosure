You could not see the lights up across the street let alone from the bright town down the road. when one friend noticed something in the sky and we all looked, about 3 of us. it was a green light bright enough to shine through thick clouds that no made made light or light from this earth could project that seemed to be descending and then just disappeared as if it left this dimension to enter another. ive always believed and never seen. and for this im grateful. proof of the 4 or possible ten dimensions. thank you."]}
