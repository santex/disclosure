It could have been about as bright as a planet, but there were none in sight to compare it to. My first thought was that we were catching a glimpse of Atlantis. It seemed to be travelling about as fast as your typical satellite, maybe a little faster. We watched it for a minute or two and it got dimmer and dimmer to eventually match the dimness of the stars around it or dimmer. It was lost in clouds eventually. It was heading northward at about 11 o'clock from the horizon. There is a possibility that it was getting dimmer because it was getting father away, because it also seemed smaller in size. We get a lot of air traffic around here, and I know it wasn't a plane or a helicopter."],"Summary":"Brighter than a star but grew dimmer as it traveled across the sky","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-07092011-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.962967,+-93.109419(30062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30062) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"30062","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in St Paul","There were no other sightings in St Paul on or around July 8th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/08/2011 11:28 UTC","Region":"Minnesota","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"44.962967","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
