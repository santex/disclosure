I had my living room blind open, saw lights which I thought were at first an aircraft. However, I noticed they were moving oddly; right to left, left to right, lights perfectly flat with the horizon, like running lights. I called relatives to tell them something odd was out there. I was scared but then looked again. If the object's lights were spread out flat with the horizon before, then they tilted to one side (I forget which side), and moved side to side, left then right, right then left as before, only with one side tilted! I closed the blinds then because I was upset. This was at dark so I could only make out lights. Looked uniform like the running lights you would see on aircraft wings. But the behavior was just odd! I couldn't make out any forward movement (ie towards the house)!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Altoona","There were no other sightings in Altoona on or around January 22nd 2011"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
