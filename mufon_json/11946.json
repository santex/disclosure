This object was overing right off the grounds of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Initially, driving towards it, I saw a pulsating white light, low in the sky. It caught my attention, and as I drove closer, I saw that it had a triangular shape, and had alternating red and white lights around it. I noticed it was not moving, and kept driving, to the point where I was directly underneath it, stopped at a traffic light. It was low to the ground--about double the height of the treeline. My window was down, and I could not hear any sound--it was completely silent. I saw it hover for another approx 5 seconds, when it slowly, without any noise, began to fly \"backwards,\" triangle-base first, in the direction of the Naval Hospital. The traffic light turned green, and I drove away, in the opposite direction that it began flying in."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bethesda","There were no other sightings in Bethesda on or around August 6th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"38.984652","Region":"Maryland","Summary":"Triangular UFO hovering near Bethesda Naval Hospital","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.984652,+-77.094709(11946)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11946) map </A>"}
