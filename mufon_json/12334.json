It was flying high in the sky at a fast speed. I originally thought that it was a plane, as I live near an airport, but then I realized that is wasn't making any sound. It was a long oval, like a cartoon version of a pill. It was white with a black line going down the middle. It was surrounded by a faint cloud. I wasn't frightened when I saw it, I was actually happy. The sighting was lost after it flew behind trees behind the house."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.321181,+-79.379481(12334)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12334) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Latrobe","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
