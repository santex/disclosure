I first noticed the object as I was just looking up at the sky and saw the unusual light patterns and the jerky movements that the craft seemed to be making around the sky and then it disappeared behind the treeline. I didn't feel any different in my actions and reactions during the sighting other than nervousness and curiousity as to where this object may be headed or what it is in general."],"Longitude":"-69.289816","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"3921","Sighting Duration":"00:03:30","Region":"Maine","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.023918,+-69.289816(3921)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3921) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
