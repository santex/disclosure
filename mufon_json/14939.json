First i noticed the TV on in someone's house. Then a plane was flying by. Then i saw a \"white dot\". I told myself i am just hallucinating but then the \"white dot\" just jolted downward and i lost sight of the object. I felt strange as if someone was staring at me at the time of the sighting. I did not capture it with my camera due to the fact that it did not want to turn on."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14939.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14939.html"],"Longitude":"-87.625948","City":"Chicago","Date Submitted":"01/15/2009 10:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Circle","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01152009-0014","Date of the Event":"01/15/2009 10:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around January 15th 2009"],"Case Number":"14939","Summary":"I just saw a ball and then it went fast down."}
