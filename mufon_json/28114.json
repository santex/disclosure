Im a recreational pilot myself and would know if that was the indicator lights people talk about. This was a ufo not a doubt in my mind. My wife and I have took pictures of the event on our cell phones and got really good pictures of it. As soon as I got my recorder out it blasted off way to quick to be a normal plane even a fighter jet. This was an amazing site. It didnt even leave a flare when it took off. THIS WAS GREAT TO SEE. IM GLAD I GOT TO WITNESS THE EVENT."],"City":"Belfry/Hardy/Toler","Case Number":"28114","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
