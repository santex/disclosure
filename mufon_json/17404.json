As I was bored I was looking up. I saw what at first I thought was a high flying jet. As I studied it I realized it was not a jet, but something eles. The object was silver in color, sort of eliptcal in shape, made no vapor trail, no noise, and was moving very fast. It was much faster than a jet. In a few seconds it was gone traveling from the north to the south."],"Summary":"High flying object.","Date Submitted":"06/09/2009 01:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.726202","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Methuen","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-71.190892","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.726202,+-71.190892(17404)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17404) map </A>","Region":"Massachusetts","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"17404","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06102009-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17404.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17404.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Methuen","There were no other sightings in Methuen on or around June 9th 2009"]}
