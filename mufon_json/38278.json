But it happens when im outside a night or in the house. The lights made me notice the object then the moving straight path it flew in. I thought at the moment the first time i saw it, Airplane but the lights went all the way around it,so i thought,UFO. The object moved in one path under cloudcover and in plain sight, i could only see lights that went all the way around it. It followed me anywhere when im outside at night. I feel, scared, afraid, curious, and want to uncover the mystery of what this is and prove whether or not extra terrestrial life is REAL. The object stayed in sight then increased speed then disappeared as soon as everyone of us locked onto the object."],"Log Number":"US-05202012-0022","Sighting Duration":"00:03:20","Case Number":"38278","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Standing outside, late night, see it everywhere i go at night, blinking lights, stays in straight path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.016222,+-81.974292(38278)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38278) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38278.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38278.html"],"Object Features":"None, Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Honaker","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"05/20/2012 12:11 UTC"}
