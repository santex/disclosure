They hovered without moving, then one object \"faded\" out, then the other. It was also witnessed by a co-worker. The duration was @ 30 seconds. We continued to watch the area, but no more activity was detected from our viewpoint. From my point of view it appeared as if they were hovering over Fort Gordon Military installation, but I can't verify this, as I couldn't determine the exact distance. II only have the other witnesses' name and don't actually know her personally, only by acquaintance on the job."],"Date Submitted":"04/11/2006 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.481456,+-82.00079(4674)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4674) map </A>"}
