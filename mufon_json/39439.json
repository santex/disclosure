It was traveling like and airplane speed but it was low. Then it went a short distance and stopped in the sky and the flame extinguished and it stayed as a fireball then. It turned to direct north started to go again quickly and stopped again and then took off in the same direction (north)towards lake Ontario and it was a white speck and I got a picture of it then but it was just a dot. I couldn't find my camera app quick enough to get a better photo of it bet it was very close to me to see very clearly and seemed to be in open sky and I can't figure out why no one else in the area didn't see it as it crossed a main highway rt 441 and then it turned into a tiny black dot and disappeared."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.125854,+-77.454924(39439)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39439) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"06/18/2012 10:27 UTC","Latitude":"43.125854","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/16/2012 08:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Penfield","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39439.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39439.html"],"Case Number":"39439"}
