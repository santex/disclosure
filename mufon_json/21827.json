I watched thinking it was a local helicopter; we have rescue and sheriff's helicopters in the area. After watching for a few minutes, I notice that the light was standing still, silent, and had a blue light to it. I walked 50 yards back to the house, got my girlfriend to watch the light, and after a minute or two we went in to get warmer jackets. When we got back out it was gone. It had been the second brightest object in the sky. The area has a lot of light pollution, the stars are not visible until at least a 50 degree angle to the horizon. The object was at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon. I had, after the incident, contacted a local UFO reporting agency that was rather rude and demeaning. They told me that I should learn the star charts and basically stop wasting people's time."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Longitude":"-122.117242","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21827.html"],"Log Number":"US-02082010-0016","Summary":"A large bright red and blue pulsating light","Case Number":"21827","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.205382,+-122.117242(21827)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21827) map </A>","City":"Arlington","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around April 14th 2009"]}
