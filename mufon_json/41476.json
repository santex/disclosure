My middle aged daughter (5 yrs) did say look UFO. I didn't think anything of it at the time and just kept driving. She did have the IPAD2 and was able to take some photos of it. Me and my oldest daughter looked at the several pics she had taken and tried to debunk it by looking at the window for debris. But what was different was the difference is size and the coloring(Shading) from the clouds and the sunlight. I will let you decide on whether it's real or not. But for the most part you can see the variation is size, shading and movement based on the pics that were taken. My daughter was able to take 3 pictures of it."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Utah","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.32535,+-111.088031(41476)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41476) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08062012-0009","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Between Moab and Montecil","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41476.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41476_submitter_file1__Pic1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41476_submitter_file2__Pic2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41476_submitter_file3__Pic3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41476.html"],"Summary":"Grey Disc with dark parts on it.","Date of the Event":"08/05/2012 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"41476","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
