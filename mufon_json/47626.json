T-section of Fern Ave. and Minton Ave. I saw a large transparent rectangle slowly floating form south to north in the sky very far from were I was standing. I tend to look at the sky when I'm walking at night just to see if there are any stars. This night was very bright grey and overcast. I quickly noticed the object. There was no solid feature, but the rectangle outline was visible against the grey sky. The outline was consistent with the moving transparent object. A car came down my street, so I walked away because sometimes cops drive by and I didn't want to look suspicious. I wish I stayed and continued to watch the object. I was just very curious. My coworker told me about MUFON and told me to report it."],"Date of the Event":"05/18/2013 11:30 UTC"}
