i am leaning on the latter thought! also, these craft seemed to \"swoop down\" from space or a very high altitude. back to the sighting...this particular object spinned in a counter clockwise direction while hovering and continued to spin when moving in a straight path towards the steam station. the object appeared to be observing lake wylie and allen steam station. the object had no noise whatsoever. the outside lighting conditions were when the sun was setting and nighttime was a few minutes from taking place. the other objects (which were farther out) appeared to be observing the charlotte airport and the other parts of lake wylie. i am a navy veteran, discharged with honors. my mos in the navy was with radar, air intercept operations and aircraft warfare. i am employed as a project manager with a mechanical engineering firm. i have been with the same company for 15 and a half years. as of this writing, i am still employed with the same company (which is established). this is not the first instance that i (and my family-multiple witnesses)have observed ufo's in the lake wylie and belmont area. i have seen a triangle back in may 2005 and also saw these disc shaped objects on separate occasion the past few months. i have pictures and video on my iphone! i will submit to a polygraph test and i am open to answer any questions. i am very interested in the ufo phenomenon since i experienced these in the past, dating back to the military. this area seems to be a definite hotspot and should be a trove of data for an investigator to look into. i will help in any way to answer questions, show the sighting location or anything else! thanks for your time and please call me any time, if you have questions, etc. on a closing note...i am very concerned about these objects interfering with the takeoff and landing patterns for the commercial\\private aircraft using the charlotte airport. i have a video from last april, which clearly shows one of these objects hovering and a commercial airplane having to take evasive action (or at least this appeared so from my angle of view) while taking off to avoid this object. there has to be some pilots\\air controllers that have knowledge of this. thanks for any help with finding some answers to this. best regards, a concerned citizen note: i have the photos and video on my iphone. i can personally provide this to an investigator or can email this."],"Summary":"7 flying discs with predominantly bright orange lights (with a hint of red glow) over Lake Wylie in Belmont, NC (by Charlotte International Airport)","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/31/2012 01:07 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.250308,+-81.030117(38681)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38681) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","Log Number":"US-05312012-0002","City":"Belmont","Case Number":"38681","Latitude":"35.250308","Longitude":"-81.030117"}
