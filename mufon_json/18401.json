{"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Diamond","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a diamond shape with definate outlines glowing but darkened inside to the Middle that glowed like the outline. It had a intersecting cross from the middle to the outside edge that glosed like the outline and center. From here (West Midland County) it was in the Northeast sky and what appeared to be miles away but was very large, 20 times what the stars in the sky were. I noticed it because it was unusual. It did not appear to move. After my dog did what she needed to do I went in the house and looked 10 minutes later and it was still there. Please get back to me if others saw this or if there is a explanation. I have had a sighting in the past 40 + years ago but it was much differant."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18401.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18401.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-84.764934","Region":"Michigan","Latitude":"43.599188","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Mt Pleasant","There were no other sightings in Mt Pleasant on or around July 30th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.599188,+-84.764934(18401)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18401) map </A>","City":"Mt Pleasant","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/30/2009 05:00 UTC","Case Number":"18401","Summary":"glowing diamond shape","Log Number":"US-07302009-0006","Date of the Event":"07/30/2009 05:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
