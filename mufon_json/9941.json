{"Log Number":"US-03142008-0011","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside with my new panasonic hdd camcorder looking at the moon, it was just the outer crest and then i noticed a bright star like object in the sky just to my right ( south )I recorded it for about 15 minutes on and off and then i realized it had not moved but the moon was moving west. I was about to go inside when for some reason i said let me just see if it does anything before i go in and as i was filming at about 7:40 I saw it just blur through the lcd screen and as i looked up with my naked eyes i just could not see it anymore. The object is in the same spot the entire time I am the one shaking and zooming in."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"32.806775","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around March 11th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.767893","Summary":"I saw a star like object at 7 15 pm march 11 and it was stationary for 30 mintutes and then it just changed.
