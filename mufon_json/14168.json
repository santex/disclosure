At first I didn't pay too much attention to them, but they kept flying over and over. I then thought, what in the world is going on out there. I went outside and was standing on my drive way looking for the jets when all of a sudden, here comes two round objects flying side by side. I thought, Oh my god! I watched then until they were out of site, then all of a sudden, here comes two more trailing behind the first two. As far as I know, I was the only one to witiness the ufo's. There was know one else outside. The objects were a good size, they were of a dull brown color, they were disc shaped and they were flying low. I lived in a different area of town at the time and we have several navy bases in the area. One has been closed. These objects were coming from the the direction of the navy base that has closed. I don't remember when the base closed, but I think it was around the time, I witnessed the UFO's."],"Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"Two UFO's flying side by side.","Case Number":"14168","Object Features":"None"}
