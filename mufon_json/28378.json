Three of us saw a craft with four star like lights traveling from South to North from Broward County over Palm Beach county and out of sight. The whole sighting was no more or less than 10 seconds. The three of us saw a craft that had no blinking lights, no wings and no other discernible features other than three lights in the form of a triangle with one other light directly in front of the top light in the triangle. Picture a triangle and then draw a straight line from the top of that triangle. The body of the craft essentially had the same color and looked like the rest of the night sky. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sounds. It was nothing that any of the three of us had ever seen before. I'd only be willing to release my contact info on a case by case situation."],"Summary":"Four lights in the sky traveling S to N at a high rate of speed with no sound.","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Boca Raton","There were no other sightings in Boca Raton on or around March 23rd 2011"],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-80.076198","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Boca Raton","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28378.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28378.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.361428,+-80.076198(28378)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28378) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
