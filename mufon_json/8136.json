{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsi had made a trip to my girlfriends hometown (portland creek) for the weekend. the sighting was behind daniels harbour, very near to portland creek. me, her and her brother where out looking in awe at the milky way when we noticed flashing lights off to the west\\north west. i pointed them out, but they had noticed already, and wondered if it was the northern lights in some fashion or a meteor shower. slowly them cam closer until the moment became so surreal. here we were watching, what i was conviced of at the time, a fleet of alien spacecraft. they were in a staggered formation.. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...kind of like this. and they moved in an east to west direction. they had three lights on the bottom of them in a triangle formation... 0 0 0 ...with a red and blue flashing light on either side of the front single light. my girlfriend said she could make out the shape of the objects. i thought i could, but wasn't too sure. she said they were triangle shaped, i though maybe they were triangled but kind of stretched into a teardrop shape. i later had a dream, about 5 days later, of them being teardropped that was very vivid. her brother appeared to be scarred and got in the car. i was amazed, shocked, in awe, and felt very peacefull. fear was nowhere in my body. eventually they passed very slowly and vanished over the tree line. i waited until the last one was out of site. there was also a solid white light that made a west to east path as the last few went over head. i also have to admit that i heard the rumble of jet engines. although very very faint and not until they first ones were well past. cfb goosebay may have been running maneuvers or whatever they do, but i have never seen lights like these on the bottoms of fighter jets."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Corner Brook","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8136.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8136.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-56.333041","Summary":"Triangles with lights","City":"Corner Brook","Case Number":"8136","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"48.606456","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"10/05/2007 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"CA-10142007-0002","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Newfoundland and Lab","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.606456,+-56.333041(8136)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8136) map </A>","Object Shape":"Teardrop, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"10/05/2007 10:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
