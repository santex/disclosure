{"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were traveling from the Cisco,Tx countryside on back roads towards Eastland,Tx and a large round white light was following us most of the way, jigg-jagging from one side of the car to the other with no sound. Our windows were all rolled down and the object was not far away but we heard nothing. We were a family of six with kids ranging from six to ten yrs of age all of whom were very excited and a little scared. This object followed us most of the way, then just darted away quickly. A few days later the object was hovering above our home for several hours while we were all outdoors having a cookout. We lived a few miles out in the country in a secluded area. I don't know if it's related, but also around about the same time of the month, our home started shaking or trembling sort of like an earthquake, although there were none reported in the area. This actually caused cracks in the mortar of our rock house. It's nice to finally get this off my mind my telling someone. Thanks."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/31/1990 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/28/2010 05:40 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"light chasing family car out in the country","Log Number":"US-08282010-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25213.html"],"Longitude":"-98.974314","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.390186,+-98.974314(25213)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25213) map </A>","City":"Cisco","Latitude":"32.390186","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Cisco","There were no other sightings in Cisco on or around August 31st 1990"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25213"}
