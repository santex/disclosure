Upon walking out to the gravel parking lot toward my vehicle, I notice a bright light in the sky at aircraft level traveling from North to South. I assumed (due to the single light) that it was probably a helicopter. Upon entering my vehicle and facing it south towards the parking lot exit, I notice that the light changed direction and was now traveling from East to West in the direction I was turning. Upon reaching the intersection between D and highway 13 a quarter mile down the road, I noticed the light was no longer paralleling the road and did not think anything of it. I would not see the light again for several minutes. Upon taking a right turn to head south on thirteen, and a subsequent left onto county road F at the corner by Harbor View Supper club and proceeding another half mile the light reappeared. It seemed to be paralleling my path down the road and wavering back and forth slightly as it moved. I convinced myself it was an optical illusion created my staring at a distant star from a moving vehicle. However, when I reached the bend in the road just before county road F intersects with county road s I was proven wrong. The disk shot over the treetops as soon as I hit the corner and appeared to stop above the treetops in the middle of the field which is owned now by a local tree farmer. As I turned onto S and proceeded home and approached the middle of the field the object seem to lower its altitude. As I drew near, it suddenly moved across the field and blocked my path in the road. The object appeared oval shaped and backlit. (Much like when someone holds a flashlight directly in your eyes so that you cannot see them) It was large enough that it stretched from one end of the road to the other. I immediately stopped my vehicle and put the car in park. The object was approximately 20 feet above the ground at this point. My window was rolled down and my radio was not on. I remember thinking about how crazy it was that I could hear the hum of my car and crickets chirping in the ditch, but no sound came from this object. After approximately thirty or so seconds (it seemed longer but could not have been) the object lowered to about the height of the roof of my car and began to approach my vehicle. I felt the hair rise on the back of my neck in a manner which I would compare to that of an excited dog. I assumed at the time it was out of fear, but now also remember somewhat of a heat or electricity in the air. At this point I placed my vehicle in reverse, performed a quick y turn, and sped away from the object. I could see its reflection in my rear view mirror until I was back on County road F and heading back to town. I sped back to town, stopped at what is now a BP gas station, and phone my parents to let them know about the event. They advised me that I had to get home somehow and may as well come back. That made sense lol. When I eventually returned to the field the object was sitting again at treetop level in the far corner of the field. It appeared to have changed in color from a bright white light to a more vanilla color. I again stopped my vehicle at the midpoint of the field, and it again moved to block the roadway. It maintained a height of approximately 40 feet from the ground. I observed the object for approximately a minute and a half. At this point another vehicle turned up County S behind me. As soon as the other vehicle came into sight, the object moved from a dead stop to a speed I could barley follow heading directly north and was suddenly gone. That is the end of my experience. There was no missing time or anything else odd about the occurrence apart from the obvious. I wish I worked for the government concerning this topic. It has held my curiosity strongly since. I do believe that these are either government vehicles or legitimate intelligently controlled vehicles not originating on Earth. I could understand in either instance the government���s desire to keep this out of sight. The ET explanation would do well to hide important aerospace technology. If I were under government employ regardless of the case, I would certainly keep this intelligence a secret in the course of serving my country. (I believe the govt. does most things with good reason)"],"Case Number":"24729","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/23/2010 07:06 UTC","Log Number":"US-07232010-0013","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Sphere","Date of the Event":"06/15/2005 11:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24729.html"],"Summary":"Followed home and confronted by large egg shaped glowing light.","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering,Other","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Phillips","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-90.40043","City":"Phillips","Region":"Wisconsin"}
