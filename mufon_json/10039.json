At first i thought it was some sort of acne and thought the might have been very large pores but ive had it for a year and looking at it closely it is more of a puncture or skin piercing and they travel inward at an angle toward eathother and i can feel something underneath the skin where it meets. Its very small but its very odd especially how symetrical the pattern is. Im not claiming abduction or anything, Ive had no experiences of anything like that. But was just wondering if you have seen this pattern before in any cases. Ive never been injured or anything that would leave that mark, its something I just noticed one day and has continued to make me think. Its probably nothing but thank you for listening."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Unidentified Scar Pattern","Date Submitted":"03/24/2008 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-03252008-0004","Region":"Hawaii","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.900666,+-155.576272(10039)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10039) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed"}
