It was already dark. I turned offthe main highway onto a rural road and at once noticed blue, revolving policelights in my rearview mirrow. Thinking that I must have made a trafficviolation, I pulled over, stopped and looked rearward. I saw nothing, no policecar,nothing. I then looked west to my right and saw an immense object justsitting there at less than 200 ft. above ground level. It was well illuminatedand I got the impression they wanted me to see it. I took one long look and leftthe scene. I looked back and it was gone. I have never told this to many peopleknowing that I would not be believed. I know this sounds absurd, butthis reallyhappened to me. I have no evidence to support this at all, but I will neverforget it. I was never really scared, just apprehensive. It was so close, that Icould have hit it with a rock."],"Date Submitted":"02/06/1970 07:00 UTC","City":"Lake Wales","Latitude":"27.901413","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1327.html"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Lake Wales","There were no other sightings in Lake Wales on or around February 6th 1970"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"","Region":"Florida"}
