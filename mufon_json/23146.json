I pointed this out to the two other individual's that were with me and we decided to go to the over-look for a closer look. Before heading down we grabbed another individual and the binoculars. Looking at the object with the naked eye we could see the colors flashing randomly; through the binoculars the object seemed to remain white in color. The object seemed to move farther away, so we decided to go back to the first place we seen the object. Once back at the original spot we lost sight of the object. This is not the first time that I have seen this type of object over Lake Erie. Between 2008 and now I have seen this occurence more than 10 times."],"Latitude":"42.135844","Summary":"Star like object changing colors to blue, green and red.","Case Number":"23146","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-05052010-0012","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/05/2010 07:36 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.135844,+-80.082169(23146)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23146) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
