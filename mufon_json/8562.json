I was living near the airport in Ottawa at the time. We were playing with the telescope stand when a large cigar shaped object suddenly lit up above us (green in colour). It moved through the sky at a slow speed and then suddenly faded gradually out of sight. It then lit up again gradually after several miles and continued moving along. It continued in this pattern until it went beyond our sight. We called the air traffic control people at the airport to see if they had seen it but to no avail."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8562.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8562.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Summary":"A cigar shaped object fading in and out (lighting)","Longitude":"-75.688953","Date Submitted":"01/10/1986 11:15 UTC","Latitude":"45.43126","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"8562","Region":"Ontario","Log Number":"CA-12072007-0001","City":"Ottawa"}
