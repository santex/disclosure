I was standing at the door waiting for him to come back in when I saw 4 or 5 solid red lights in a row with a flashing white light on the rear. It was traveling faster than I have ever seen an airplane travel over my house and appeared a lot closer. It was traveling from the North West to the South East. I watched it until it was no longer visible because of the roof of my house. I checked with an online satellite website and found there was no aircraft in the immediate area. I printed a copy of the radar image and the flight number of the closest aircraft. The weather was 33 degrees F. with clear skies."],"Log Number":"US-02212012-0005","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"02/21/2012 05:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Campbellsville","There were no other sightings in Campbellsville on or around February 3rd 2012","This sighting has been favorited 2 times.",""],"Latitude":"37.33536","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.33536,+-85.343898(35963)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35963) map </A>","Summary":"4 or 5 solid red lights in a row with a flashing white light on the rear","Region":"Kentucky","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/03/2012 04:35 UTC","Longitude":"-85.343898","City":"Campbellsville"}
