I noticed the light to the west of my house. (NOTE: This is the forth time I have seen this thing.) It is too bright to be a star or sattellite. It is a single orange light so, it isnt any kind of commercial vehicle. It seemed pretty motionless for a min or so. Then began to slowly move south-west. I had to move to the front yard to continue watching it. It seemed to stop moving and began to flicker slowly. Very dim to bright. It did this a few times and just looked like it shut itself off. Leaving me feeling kind of creeped out. Seeing this object a fourth time, has prompted me to make a report. I am pretty distressed. I want to know what this thing is."]}
