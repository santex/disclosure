At first I thought it was a T.V. news station reporting on traffic but I have seen helicoters before and this was not one of them, plus it made no noise??????? It flew across the high way pulsating and then I lost sight of it. After I was trying to find an explanation for what I just saw and I could not make any sense of it. This is the first time I have seen something so awesome and I was just wondering if any one else had seen this object in the sky that morning."],"Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","City":"Chicago","Date Submitted":"03/20/2012 05:08 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"36611","Longitude":"-87.621648"}
