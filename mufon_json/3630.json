Judging by how it moved I'd guess it was some kind of vertical take off jet but it was by far the strangest thing I've ever seen in my life. 2 minutes after it disappeared I called 911 reporting it to the local police. Despite how crazy I felt reporting it they took my call quite seriously and are looking into the matter."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3630.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3630.html"]}
