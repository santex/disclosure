I looked towards the north east and saw movement, a group of lights, shadows almost, moving at a high rate of speed. I am a sky watcher, always have been, and have never seen anything like this. I first thought it was a plane moving away from me, but the arc of movement seemed goofy. It was a triangle shaped group of lights, the boarder was brighter then the middle. It seemed to be moving in a sweeping motion, and moving fast. I havent seen anything like this flying around fort hood in ten months. It was like watching wonder womans plane flying. I gotta tell ya, this made me feel really goofy. Again, I have never seen anything like this. I was going to call me wife out to look, but it was moving to fast, then it began to fade, then it was gone. A chopper with a very bright blood red light came from the south within seconds of this thing fading. The chopper didnt seem to be in a hurry, but the bright blood red light seemed goofy, i dont recall seeing anything like that either. It kinda made my skin crawl really... The object was there and gone within 15 seconds, it just faded out of view."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22913.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22913.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Harker Heights","Case Number":"22913","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Harker Heights","There were no other sightings in Harker Heights on or around April 20th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.08351,+-97.659738(22913)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22913) map </A>","Latitude":"31.08351","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Summary":"shadowish lights moving east to north to west, heading to fort hood","Date Submitted":"04/20/2010 10:33 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
