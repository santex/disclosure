DECIDED BEFORE I WENT UPSTAIRS TO BED TO LOOK OUT OF FRENCH WINDOWS AND LOOK AT THE STARS. WHEN I LOOKED UP I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING. QUICKLY RUSHED UPSTAIRS TO MY BEDROOM TO LOOK OUT FROM BEDROOM WINDOW, THE OBJECTS WERE STILL THERE. THEY WERE MOVING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UP AND DOWN. RUSHED BACK DOWNSTAIRS FEELING EXCITED AND SCARED. PUT MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH IN ABSOLUTE SHOCK. ONE BY ONE I DISMISSED ALL THE THINGS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN, LANTERNS, BALLOONS, SPACE DEBRIS, WEATHER BALLOONS, MAYBE LIGHTS REFLECTED FROM AIRCRAFTS, COVERT AIRCRAFT. IVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIESE OBJECTS IN THE SKY BEFORE. THEY WERE STATIONARY, THEN ONE OF THE ORBS WOULD EITHER REVERSE, ANOTHER WOULD TRAVEL DOWN THEN UP, COME FORWARD THEY ALL DID THIS FOR SOME TIME THEN WOULD STOP. AND REPEAT. SHOCKED STUNNED ALL I COULD SAY WAS OH MY GOD REPEATEDLY. WITH MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH. I THINK I WAS IN A STATE OF SHOCK, THEY SUDDENLY REVERSED VERY QUICKLY INTO THE NIGHT, IT TOOK A SECOND."],"Log Number":"GB-10212013-0011","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.022705,+0.965035(51704)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51704) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/25/2013 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"52.022705","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
