Thought it was just a street light but soon realized it was much higher than the trees. As I kept driving I looked to my left to see if the people on the motorcycles had noticed but they didn't look up. I pulled over onto w marietta to step out at take a video. Then I noticed a second object that appeared to be a distance apart but moving in the same hoovering pulsating motion as the first. At this point both objects started to move to the northwest over MacArthur high school. As soon a I start to video my phone shuts off and the objects had moved out of sight! Leaving me with a short video. At first I do everything I can to determin what I saw. Call my wife and told her what I saw. If it was a plane since when do they allow two to fly so close to each other and what kind hoovers and pulsates?!!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/09/2012 09:25 UTC","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Decatur","There were no other sightings in Decatur on or around June 9th 2012"],"Longitude":"-88.977631","Case Number":"39125","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"2 orange rounded squares pulsated, hooverd and took directional path northwest over MacArthur high school.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39125.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39125.html"],"Log Number":"US-06102012-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.850901,+-88.977631(39125)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39125) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Region":"Illinois","Latitude":"39.850901","City":"Decatur"}
