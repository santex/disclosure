While my neck was craned back and I was looking directly overhead I saw a small amorphous bit of light traveling fast North to South. The whole sighting lasted only 2 to 3 seconds. The bit of light moved left to right a couple of times then traveled a little further in the same N-S direction and was gone before it hit the horizon. As soon a I noticed the light and the speed I knew it was not a plane or a bird or a reflection or swamp gas. As soon as it was gone I called my wife to tell her. I was quite excited. As I watched it I yelled \"Holy Crap\"."]}
