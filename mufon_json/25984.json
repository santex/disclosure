I stopped to ask what they were staring at and one pointed at an object which to me looked like a long vapour trail. The sky was clear except for some clouds in the western horizon which were slightly reddish as it was near sunset. I mentioned to others that it could be a vapour trail from a jet plane but I was told that this was not possible as the object changed directions very rapidly and it was clearly solid. In effect, as I stared at the object it suddenly flipped 90 degrees and it started to slowly move in our direction. It was difficult to judge the distance of the object since we could not tell its size but if it was 200-300 meters in length then it may have been over Brookline Ma or perhaps further west at an altitude of 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon. As we stared mesmerized over a period of 5-10 or minutes the object suddenly again flipped 90 degrees at such a speed that the eye could not follow the movement and it started to move more rapidly towards the north. The object was now closer to us but while it was still impossible to judge its distance (perhaps over Harvard University?), one could clearly discern that the pencil-shaped object was indeed solid and metallic looking with a slight golden tinge. The object disappeared behind some tall buildings in the Cambridge area. Suddenly to the south two USAF single engine propeller planes appeared in close formation obviously to us in pursuit of the object which was no longer visible. To my knowledge we did not report our observations but there were reports from other witnesses in the Boston area as reported by the Boston Daily Globe newspaper on 22 October 1957. Unfortunately, the observers quoted all appeared to confuse the object with the discarded Sputnik rocket, which was clearly impossible to have seen in space (the launching had been earlier that month). Attached is a clipping of the Boston Globe report. Also attached is a copy of a letter from the USAF dated 22 October reporting a sighting of a pencil-shaped object at 13:35 on 12 October 1957 near Martha���s Vineyard by a fishing vessel."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25984.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25984_submitter_file1__SCAN0020.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25984_submitter_file2__SCAN0021.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25984.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.367111","Region":"Massachusetts","Longitude":"-71.050563","Summary":"Lead pencil-shaped object hovering west of MIT campus at altitude 30-40 degrees and chaging directions at incredible speeds.","Log Number":"US-10202010-0003","Source":"MUFON"}
