I saw a very bright object moving slowly in the sky from South to North. For a second I thought it was a planet or a star. Then I noticed it moving slowly. thnen I thought it might be an airplane or a helicopter with landing lights. I thought it had to be, it was too bright. Then, I noticed there were no strobe lights of any kind. I grabbed my binoculus and focused on it. As I have said, it was a very bright light that discharged an itty-bitty small light from the stern and picked up the speed. It looked like the little light had its own power and accelerated away. It looked like a little white dot. The main object started to pick up speed very fast, changed color to a dull orange glow and disappeared over the trees. The whole thing lasted two minutes."],"Date of the Event":"04/09/2012 08:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Gainesville","There were no other sightings in Gainesville on or around April 9th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.658634,+-82.317046(37329)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37329) map </A>","Longitude":"-82.317046","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Gainesville","Tags":"City"}
