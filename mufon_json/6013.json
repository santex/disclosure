At first, I thought it was a meteor because I have viewed several meteor showers and the brightness of the object was similar. It was low enough that I thought it might crash into our house. Then we realized three unusual things about this meteor. First, it did not leave a debris trail or smoke trail like meteors usually do when they enter the earth's atmosphere. Second, this object was not falling out of the sky at terminal velocity, but soundlessly flying across the sky faster than any fighter jet - and we always get those flying overhead on the way to Miramar NAS. Third, it was oval-shaped. Being in the aerospace industry, neither of us could recall any oval-shaped objects that flew faster than a jet. We could not conclude what it was, but we know it was not a meteor."],"Summary":"low flying oval ufo","Date of the Event":"12/23/2006 06:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6013.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6013.html"],"Latitude":"33.044321","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Ramona","There were no other sightings in Ramona on or around December 23rd 2006"],"Log Number":"US-12282006-0003","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","City":"Ramona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.044321,+-116.860322(6013)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6013) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-116.860322","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
