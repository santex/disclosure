I once wrote about wanting to see a UFO ���if only to know they existed.��� After what happened some time later, I���ve been wondering if ���they��� heard me. I remember that day clearly. It was on July 23, 2008 ��� a beautiful day with a clear blue sky. It was late afternoon and still light outside. I was in the kitchen making dinner and standing over the stove next to the large kitchen window. My husband was in the living room sitting at his computer. I glanced out the window and saw a round disk flying slowly over the rooftops of the other apartment buildings. It moved very smoothly and was completely silent -- no engine noise -- nothing. It was made of some kind of white metallic substance that glistened like ice. I���ve never seen that type of metal before. I couldn���t see any windows or who was piloting it. I was surprised but not really afraid. I don���t know why. I just stared at it. There was a soft blue light underneath it that glowed. The blue light shimmered and seemed stronger toward the front of the craft. It passed right above my kitchen window heading in a southern direction. As it passed I saw it join another craft exactly like it. The second one was some distance away at a higher altitude. The first craft joined it and they silently flew side by side in a perfect formation. I watched them until they were far away and disappeared into the horizon. I stood in the kitchen for a long time after that. I���m not sure how long. I think I was still in shock. But I wasn't afraid. I don���t know why. After some time (not sure how long) I went into the dining room. I didn���t know how to tell my husband about what I���d just seen. I thought he wouldn���t believe me. I finally did tell him about it. I think he wanted to believe me, but he���s not quite sure what to think. I don���t blame him. I also couldn���t believe it happened. I feel I���ve changed since then. I never thought much about life beyond my daily experience, especially not anything about space or ETs. That was the stuff of movies. I started reading a lot about other people���s experiences with UFOs and about other sightings in different places around the world. I needed information, and some answers. I read that other people have also had similar experiences, and that many of them are also trying to come to terms with it. Sometimes when I think back to that day, I can���t believe it. But it was real ��� not a movie. I feel more people will begin to see and report UFO sightings. They will continue to increase. It���s as if a global shift is happening. Maybe I���m imagining it, but some days I can sense them in my thoughts. I sometimes see fleeting images of them in my head. It���s not a negative feeling. It���s more like thinking about someone you vaguely know. I tend to look up at the sky more often like I���m waiting for something to happen, but I don���t know what. I���ve read about people who���ve had experiences similar to mine. They���ve also seen ETs but are reluctant to report it or talk about it. I feel their contact with our planet will continue to increase. There���s more discussion about ETs now than ever before. It���s as if we���re gradually being prepared to make a quantum leap in our perception of the universe."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"2 UFOs Flew Over Apt.
