I was walking toward the house as the objects were flying over the houses. I tried to figure out what they were but when I realized I'd never seen anything like this before so I ran to the house & told my kids to come & see & then every two min we saw them fly over & saw 8 total. As they went over the orange light was dimer from behind the objects. I couldn't hear any noise from them so I asked my daughter if she heard anything and she said no. I was amazed and confused because I don't know what we had seen. I took some pictures with my phone just to show some proof. The sky was clear with some clouds. The normal air traffic looked routine for the time of day. The planes in the sky were clear & there lights were easy to see. The objects flew into a low cloud until they were out of sight."],"Region":"North Carolina","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11092013-0024","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Gastonia","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-81.074292","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Other"}
