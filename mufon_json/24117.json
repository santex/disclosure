I saw a weird object in the sky that appeared right over Onarga, Illinois. It looked like an orange fire ball or disk shaped object. I have never seen anything before in my life. It appeared out of no where and was heading toward the north north east during the time. It was not losing altitude and was not going out so it couldn't of been a firework. It was traveling very fast at very high speeds but not enough to create a sonic boom. I know for a fact that this was no aircraft cause I have never seen an aircraft like that before."],"City":"Onarga","Case Number":"24117","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24117.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24117.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"It looked like an orange fireball or disk shaped object..","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
