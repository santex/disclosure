{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside on the deck of my parents house smoking a cigarette with my brother's girlfriend. It was about 6:55pm. I noticed three lights in the sky that looked like red flares falling from the sky -- extremely bright with a tail. The lights fell in an almost free fall and moving away from each other for about 10 seconds until going dim at about 20 degrees above the horizon. Seconds later three red burning lights reappeared in nearly the same area in the sky, and hovered in place while slowly pulsating on and off. These lights hovered there for about two minutes and were witnessed by myself, my mom and brother, and my brother's girlfriend. After two minutes, the lights began to slowly move in towards each other to form a single point of light. This light then descended closer to the ground, approximately 300 ft. off the ground (about 10 degrees from the horizon). The light then simply faded out into the dark sky."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33802.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33802.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"33802","City":"Springboro","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Springboro","There were no other sightings in Springboro on or around December 3rd 1984"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/03/2011 09:31 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Date of the Event":"12/03/1984 06:55 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.556272,+-84.231312(33802)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33802) map </A>","Summary":"Three balls of fire fall from the sky and go dim, then reappear in linear form.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.231312","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.556272","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12032011-0019"}
