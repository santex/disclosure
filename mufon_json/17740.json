{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn June 19, 1986, I was standing on the beach at Panama City, Florida, with two friends. It was getting late in the day, the sun was going down, and I looked out to sea toward the horizon and saw 3 delta-wing shaped craft flying in \"V\" formation. I got one of my friend's attention and pointed the craft out to him. We noticed that they were transparent or semi-transparent at least. I remember we could see sky through them. We watched as they flew off at a high rate of speed into the southwestern sky over the Gulf of Mexico and disappeared. From the time we noticed them to the time they disappeared was about 30 seconds. We went back to our beach house and my friend and I both drew on napkins what we saw. We compared drawings and we both saw the same thing. Not a day has gone by in the past 23 years that I have not thought about what we saw on the beach that night."],"Latitude":"30.164553","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Summary":"Panama City, Florida: 3 transparent delta-wing shaped objects flying in a V- formation.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06302009-0010","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.164553,+-85.654706(17740)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17740) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/19/1986 07:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/19/1986 07:15 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Panama City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17740.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17740.html"],"trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Panama City","There were no other sightings in Panama City on or around June 19th 1986"],"Longitude":"-85.654706","Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Case Number":"17740"}
