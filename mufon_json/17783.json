This night, something caught my attention steaking across the sky. It was approx about 3 miles away and very high up in the air. I noticed the object was zig zagging up and down and accelerating at a high rate of speed. It didnt seem to be in any type of order or pattern. I grabbed my cell phone that has a 1.3 megapixal camera. The object was 2 light conjoined on one object. I have enclosed 2 pics of 2 different objects on 2 different nights that very similar but were moving in different fashions 3 months apart."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Jacksonville","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville on or around May 19th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.755202,+-77.423911(17783)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17783) map </A>","City":"Jacksonville"}
