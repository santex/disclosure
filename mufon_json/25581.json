I wouldn���t have noticed these objects at all except for a bizarre incident that happened first, so I���ve described that as well.) Yesterday was a beautiful sunny Sunday morning with a clear blue sky. I was out walking southward around 10:00 a.m. on a Fort Collins street, warming up for a run when something very strange caught my eye. About 40-50 feet above a house across the street to the west was a gigantic group of large birds, moving circularly in a tight funnel, wider at the top and narrower below. This house has been under renovation the last few weeks, so my first impression was that they possibly were buzzards that had found something upturned from the construction. The pattern of their circulation and thermal-riding was somewhat like the vultures-above-man-in-desert clich���, but I dismissed that notion as unlikely to occur above this urban house, and there were far too many of them. There were at least 40 birds, maybe even 50 or 60. Moreover, it appeared to be not a homogeneous flock of crows or other single species but a mixed group with variable sizes. This included a number of large birds that were clearly raptors, with big wingspans and brown feathers. Any one of those would be noteworthy in this area, but very odd in that quantity and nearness to each other. I realized this loose ���bird tornado��� was actually slowly moving eastward and not staying above the house where I first noted them. As the still-circling formation started to pass over the street toward me, small numbers of birds peeled off and flew over my head eastward. It was while looking up at these smaller bunches of birds flying overhead that I saw two clear pinpoint lights above and beyond them to the south. One was white, and the other was red or very slightly pinkish-red. The white one was brighter and steady. The red one initially fluctuated a little in brightness but wasn���t blinking. As they moved farther away, the red one appeared steady also. I stopped looking at the bird funnel still passing over me and tried to figure out what those lights were. They were moving, but very slowly. They were not planes or helicopters. There was no sound except low ambient city noise (the birds were silent also). They had the clear bright quality of light-emitting sources, unlike reflected light off a balloon. If it weren���t the middle of a bright sunny day, they might have passed as stars. I���d say when I first saw them they were at about a 50��� angle from my vantage point, at a very rough guess 400-800 feet up. They were initially close enough to overhead that I automatically associated them with the birds��� strange behavior, although nothing logical warrants that. From that point on, I barely paid attention to the birds as they travelled eastward, although the last time I glanced, the funnel was breaking up about a block to the east. The two lights were slowing moving south and upward. Their positions relative to one another changed, but the distance between the two objects didn���t. First the red light was to the upper right, then moved to lower right and possibly behind, then back to the upper right. Relative to my position they eventually dropped slightly in the sky (40��� or so) and shrank as they moved southward, but stayed more or less in the same spot in the sky as they diminished because of increasing altitude. I tracked them into the brilliance of the blue sky for about five minutes; they were faintly visible to an extremely long distance away. There is the possibility that these were flares of some kind lofted by balloons, but I have several problems with that theory. Although the distance was tricky to judge, initially I think they were close enough that I should have seen something supporting them, and there was nothing. They also would have to be linked together somehow to maintain that consistent distance. There would have to be a substantial and consistent linear north wind at their altitude to move them, but yesterday was a very still day, at least on the ground. As I said, I can���t help but link them with the birds��� anomalous behavior, although I have nothing logical to justify that other than their proximity."],"Case Number":"25581","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Slow-moving daylight white and red stars","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Latitude":"40.59375","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Fort Collins","There was one other sighting in Fort Collins on or around September 26th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
