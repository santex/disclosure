It was due west. I have seen similar things before but were unable to get a really good look at it with the binoculars I have. We have been admiring the clear moon images the last few nights. He noticed the object and pointed out that it was displaying many colors. I used the railing to stabilize the binoculars and got a really good look at it. It was indeed displaying different colors that were not FAA identifiers. Just as in the past, this object appeared to be stationary but my recollections in the past have been that it gets lower in the sky as the night progresses. It is still visible. He will be up late so he will continue to observe. it is now 10:43 PM."],"Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
