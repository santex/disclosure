I���m married and we���ve lived in Paris for several years. We live on the 4th floor in a classical French building. There are other apartment buildings across the courtyard from ours. But the building directly across ours is approximately two floors shorter. The day before yesterday, July 23, 2008, was a clear day. At about 7:00 pm, I was in the kitchen and standing over the stove making dinner. The stove is right next to a large kitchen window. From my kitchen window I have an unobstructed view of the horizon. While I was cooking I happened to glance out the window, and I saw two oval shapes moving silently across the sky. They were silvery with a bluish glow and completely silent. They flew slowly at a low altitude ��� much lower than a plane ��� and maintained a formation, flying side by side the entire time. I watched them for a couple of minutes. Then my husband came into the kitchen and drew my attention away from the window. I was afraid to tell him what I���d just seen and that it was still outside our window. I don���t know why. I knew they were UFOs. But I guess I couldn���t believe it myself. When he walked out of the kitchen I turned back to the window and I could still see them. They were some distance away now and were still side by side as they slowly headed west. I watched them a little longer. By then it had gotten darker. I felt so strange. I finished cooking, walked out of the kitchen and served dinner in our dining area. I finally did tell my husband about it but I���m not sure he believes me. I���m still trying to make sense of it myself. I know what I saw. But I don���t know what to do, if anything. I���m reporting it because maybe someone else who lives in my area saw them and also reported it."],"Region":"ÃÂle-de-France","Country":"France","City":"Paris","Date Submitted":"06/23/2008 07:00 UTC","Latitude":"48.861444","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.861444,+2.356682(11726)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11726) map </A>","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Paris","There were no other sightings in Paris on or around June 23rd 2008"]}
