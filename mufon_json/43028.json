[name removed\\cms\\dr] points it out and says it looks weird. i ask if there is a tower in that area, but still even so, the light is too bright. its a triangle of three white lights, and thats all that it appears to be at first. we pull up to the second stop-light before the turn onto marsh where we would then turn onto marsh rd. still stopped, observing the light, about 15 seconds after we notice it, the object ascends about 100-200 ft. it then moves to the right of our vantage point, heading northwest from its position. as it passed by, we rolled down our windows. it appeared low and we heard only a slight hum, if anything. other cars were present. then a much smaller blinking red light appeared on the bottom. it blinked like a plane light would, repetitively with even timing. i kept moving to our right until eventually it had gone by some trees and out of our sight. due to the blinking red light, we wrote it off for the night as an airplane, but recalling exactly what happened puts a plane out of question. and upon searching for similar events on google, i found a photo and reports of similar sightings in other countries. conclusive description: triangular. three bright white lights, angled as if the vehicle was pointing down like a helicopter. blinking red light in the center. quiet hum, if anything. this is what i saw, except the white lights were brighter, and of course it moved as i described, not as it does in this video.
