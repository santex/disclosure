(8x30 carl zeiss). the binoculars gave me a very clear view of the orangey ball. the ball looked like it was a perfect sphere emitting a constant bright orange glow, there also appeared to be a very slight ultra violet iridescent glow similar to burning meths. having witnessed similar events three times now, i am still unsure if these balls are solid or gaseous? the local weather conditions at the time of the above sightings were a crisp cold night with extremely good visibility. both stars and high flying aircraft were crystal clear to naked eye. each time i have seen these strange events they have been travelling at similar altitudes, my guess would be between 500\\1000 feet. my guess as to size would be about 1 to 2 metres or 3 to 6 ft in diameter (i could be completely wrong with these estimates, however it is what my eyes and brain were telling me each time) the first time i witnessed these red balls (approximately 2yrs ago) i saw 2 balls travelling together in a straight line at a much higher speed in a southerly direction. two weeks later i saw a singular ball travelling - in a westerly direction! i did speak about what i had seen to my wife and friends and decided drop the subject of conversation after feeling like everybody was giving me strange looks and suggesting i drop the subject. since seeing the red balls in the sky last thursday night i have done a little internet researching. it appears these sightings have been going on since ww2. (check foo fighters see wikipedia). there also seems to be a significant increase in sightings just recently according to other ufo websites. i am 53 years old with a degree in physics and have good eye sight and questioning mind. it has certainly got me thinking! if someone had told me the above story before i had seen it for myself, i would have thought they were barking mad. maybe i should give up smoking in the garden and stay indoors!"],"Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43715.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43715.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"England","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"51.918911","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.918911,+-0.664526(43715)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43715) map </A>","Log Number":"GB-11052012-0008","Date of the Event":"11/01/2012 10:10 UTC","Longitude":"-0.664526"}
