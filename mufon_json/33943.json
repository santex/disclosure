I am not an expert but if an object that was this close to the ground made a contrail as big as these were, there should have been some kind of noise. On the first night I observed two contrails that were being sweep by the wind at home during the early evening hours around 6pm-6:30pm with my wife and the second was early in the morning around 4am-4:30am while on my way to work. I am not sure if these were created by man made vehicles or what, but I was hoping I could possibly get some kind of answer one way or another, the whole thing was very weird, I hope I can get some insight on this!
