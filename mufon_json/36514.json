My initial thought was what is that? It was not an airplane it was not a helicopter and it was not a bird. It was moving at a significant speed with no sound and as it moved trees began to obstruct my view so I ran to get a better look and it appear for emit a light from inside the object (a dull white light briefly pulsed) it was not aircraft lighting I am sure of that. then it disappeared into the cloud cover. It was a rainy day and I am not sure what the cloud deck was but it was below cloud level. After about 20 seconds it disappeared into the clouds. My initial reaction was confusion, then curiosity. I only wish I had a camera in my hands."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Maineville","There were no other sightings in Maineville on or around March 12th 2012"],"Longitude":"-84.248572","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"36514","Log Number":"US-03162012-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/16/2012 10:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.304488,+-84.248572(36514)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36514) map </A>","Latitude":"39.304488"}
