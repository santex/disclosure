Their movement was very steady and they were not real close together so there didn't seem to be any particular formation. The moon was very bright and full so we were admiring it when we saw them. The six of us all stood mesamerized by this sigting. By the time I ran up stairs and into the house and found my camera and found the way to turn off the flash they were going out of sight. I would say we observed them for approx. 5 minutes."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.673547,+-81.509454(14881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14881) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14881.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14881","Log Number":"US-01112009-0007","Date of the Event":"01/10/2009 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Florida","City":"cms/tg/na"}
