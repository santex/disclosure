Only thing was it was basically overhead and was really really bright and moving pretty fast. i hold a canadian commercial pilots licence and routinley watch the night sky. this was different in the way that i could not see any normal lights on a plane; no strobe no green or red or flashing red tail light. just one very bright silent with no exaust trail. i could not make a shape out as it was soo bright and quite high. i followed it with my eye untill it went on its path into the distance and disapeared out of sight behind the trees. I dont know what it was but it got my attention. i tried to take video with my iphone but realized the video was not showing the object."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-06062012-0016","Latitude":"43.077985","Date Submitted":"06/06/2012 11:34 UTC","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"06/06/2012 11:02 UTC","City":"Ilderton","Region":"Ontario","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.077985,+-81.386277(38916)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38916) map </A>"}
