We had just finished dinner downstairs at the hotel and returned to the room at 7:00 PM. We were looking at the view from the room (24th floor facing north). Looking out over the bay, I spotted a small white cloud in a weird shape. I mentioned to my sister my previous UFO sighting on December 14th, 2012. She dismissed it. I started taking photos. A few minutes later, some lights dropped down from the cloud and headed north. I missed this photo opportunity because I was doubting myself. But later I started taking photos again because the lights were coming on down below on the street. I found the lights in formation when I enlarged the photos on my digital camera. Also a military plane can be seen in the upper left top corner of one of the photos. Everything was headed north and east out of the picture."],"Date of the Event":"05/18/2013 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/10/2013 02:25 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
