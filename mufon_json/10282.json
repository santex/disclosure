Objects were about 65 feet off the ground , no bright lights were visible coming from objects. They caught my attention cause i thought they were birds, but after watching these objects they appeared to wobble. After watching them , they passed over a tree and above the trees they dissapeared. They traveled about 5 MPH , they were about the size of a large ball, with about two feet inbetween them. I was not scared just excited."],"Latitude":"33.881334"}
