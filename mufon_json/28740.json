First thoughts were that it was a helicopter so did not mention or say anything about it. Then as it began to get closer i started noticing a small flame like tail behind it, that is when i told friend if they see that too and what it was. No one knew what it was but as it was crossing the clear night sky it looked like a comet but i was confused. A lot of thoughts ran threw mt mind to what it was. Was it a missle? dying star? Shooting star? Not sure but what i am sure is i wasnt the only one to see this event, 100s of people were there that night. I tried to record the event but my cell phone camera didnt capture anything since it was to dark. The final seconds of the object before it vanished were this. The orange fireball disappeared for a second then seem to explode and turned white and slowly faded away into space."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-118.482381","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Flash, Star-like","Date of the Event":"04/14/2011 09:25 UTC","Region":"California","Summary":"Fireball in the sky?","City":"Santa Monica","Country":"United States"}
