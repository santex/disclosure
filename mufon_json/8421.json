It is a turistic place, near the harbor of S���o Sebasti���o, in S���o Paulo. I have a house there where i spend holidays and weekends. I was in the town cause of my vacations and was walking outside the house, preparing to go out on dinner. I cant remember the exact date, but I���m sure that was on 97���s January. In Brazil, at this time, multiple sights of UFO was notice, including a case known as \"The Varginha Incident\". This case is known as the Brazilian Rosswell and, in my opinion, is one of the most significant cases evolving UFOs cause there is reports of a two lives EBEs. I was outside the house, preparing myself to go out when I saw a lot of people looking the the sky. The night had clear weather, without clouds. I saw a yellow circle, moving in eliptic way. Going up and down very fast. Then this \"circle\" stoped in air for a while and begin changing color. Blue, Red, White, Purple and Yellow again. I saw the flight for about 5 ~ 10 minutes, then the circle disappeared in a fast flight. No aircraft, at least any known by the public, could flight in that way. Neither a weather ballon could."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/31/1996 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.778658,+-45.358397(8421)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8421) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Log Number":"BR-11212007-0003"}
