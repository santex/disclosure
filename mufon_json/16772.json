I was walking home from playing football with my brother. At first i thought it was some kind of flair untill it didnt disappear and it kept going up into the sky, it flew up really fast then stopped and veired right untill it turned white when it touched a white dot that appeared it disappeared. Im quite scared and as soon as me and my brother saw it we ran home and told my mum and now im reporting it, it disappeared behind a cloud then i havnt seen it since."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"GB-05022009-0013","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Preston","There were no other sightings in Preston on or around May 2nd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Country":"United Kingdom","Date Submitted":"05/02/2009 09:55 UTC","Latitude":"53.772561","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.772561,+-2.69961(16772)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16772) map </A>","Region":"England","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"A small orange dot in the sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16772.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16772.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/02/2009 09:55 UTC"}
