I had just laid back down facing an open window overlooking the neighborhoods below. I was slmost asleep when I noticed a bright light shining on me through my closed eyes. I opened my eyes, woke my husband and we watched a silent object that didn't seem very far away move south across the sky. The object seemed to be at the same level as us. It kept its beam of light facing our bedroom for about 10 seconds and then it moved the beam facing the direction it was headed...south. It just kept moving south until it was out of our view. I did not get up to watch it through a different window as I felt paralyzed with fear. My husband walked around the house a little just to check to make sure doors were locked, but he also did not look out another window to watch it go."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Minnesota","Summary":"Silent object flying low headed south at consistent speed shined light in bedroom window","Log Number":"US-05012013-0004","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/27/2013 01:12 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.736389,+-93.21473(47096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47096) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"47096","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Apple Valley","There were no other sightings in Apple Valley on or around April 27th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.736389","Date Submitted":"05/01/2013 10:37 UTC"}
