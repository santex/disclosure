We were heading west on FM 507 approximately 3 miles west of our home when I noticed this exceptionally bright light in the northern part of the sky. A first I thought it was the moon but I never saw the moon in the part of the sky nor was it ever that bright. We watched this light for several miles until we were getting ready to turn. All of a sudden, the light did a \"S\" manuver and went straight up an was gone in the blink of an eye. My older brother who was driving rather slowly turned to me and I asked him what was that? He said that it wasn't anything we have today that could that. P.S. At this time, I do not want third parties involved with me. If you are interested in a couple more sightings let me know."],"Date of the Event":"04/14/1968 08:00 UTC","Latitude":"26.194801","Source":"MUFON","City":"Harlingen","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02212011-0017","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"08:10:00","Case Number":"27940","Date Submitted":"02/21/2011 06:48 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Harlingen","There were no other sightings in Harlingen on or around April 14th 1968"],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27940.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27940.html"]}
