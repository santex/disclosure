I was looking out the window, towards the sky, when I saw two lights, hovering, in a stationary position, in the sky. They were, from my viewpoint, about the size of pennies. I made a remark to my mother, and she looked at them and said it was an airplane. I saw no blinking lights that are common on airplanes and then mentioned to her that it seemed to be hovering in one spot. Then she also took notice, and said it was strange. We just kept driving to our destination. We drove back, the same direction, about 15 to 20 minutes later and the lights were STILL there. They looked as if they had moved a few hundred feet. We drove past. I was not there to see how the lights disappeared."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.084262,+-86.917557(31528)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31528) map </A>","Region":"Tennessee","City":"Nashville","Date Submitted":"09/04/2011 06:22 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
