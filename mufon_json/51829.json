Then thought it was a plane. I watched thinking it must be coming straight toward or away from me because it didn't move. I used a tree branch to gage it. I then used binocular and it seemed to take shape of a circle with lights along outside and inside edges. Not trusting my view I changed to a rifle scope. I then clearly saw it was an elongated triangle with lights inside and out. It glew brightly and colors changed in this pattern yellow green blue white then orange. I didn't have a camera that would have done this justice. It just stayed in same place about an hour or more I stopped watching but when inside I drew it marked date and time and pattern of lights. Next 2-3 nights at same time I came out to see if it was a star but have not even seen a star in that same area and no other flashing objects at all. This experience left me thinking if anyone else saw it but I may never know. I have had other experiences in my life I regret not reporting and didn't want this left untold.
