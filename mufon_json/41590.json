There had been a helicopter circling around for about 2 hours & I wanted to see if it was still there. Instead, I saw 2 small, bright triangular shaped objects in the sky. As I watched them, I noticed that they were moving. They hovered, zig zagged, made small circles & shot a short distance across the sky before stopping abruptly & changing direction. My husband & father both saw the same thing. They were still in the sky when I went to bed around 2am & I counted at least 10 of them spread out among the stars. My brother saw the same objects a few nights ago & last week my husband saw a very big glowing triangle in the sky above our driveway."],"City":"Sanger","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Sphere, Triangle"}
