{"Region":"North Dakota","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Was going straight down, disappeared into clouds, was visible for a few minutes","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving from Fargo to Bismarck, and around the western edge of stutsman county I saw something egg or tear dropped shaped going straight down. It came from the very top of my windshield (line of vision) and disappeared into some clouds so was only visible for a few minutes, but more than enough time to see that it was something I have never seen before. I was on the phone with a friend while this was happening and they suggested taking a pic, but because it was so small and white looking compared to the blue of the sky, I figured my phone camera wouldn't work anyways. My windshield also had bug splatters, but what I saw was definitely not bug debris. It was white in appearance, like what you see when a jet goes overhead, though this was much larger (presumably much closer and going straight down towards the earth)."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.919334,+-98.704396(29680)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29680) map </A>","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Teardrop","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Jamestown","There were no other sightings in Jamestown on or around June 17th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.919334","Date of the Event":"06/17/2011 07:05 UTC","Case Number":"29680","Longitude":"-98.704396","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29680.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29680.html"],"City":"Jamestown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/22/2011 06:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06222011-0010"}
