We were both looking out the windshield. Then we saw a bright bluish-white teardrop shaped THING float past us. It was unlike anything I've ever seen, definitely not a man made aircraft. It was almost like an orb, made out of energy or light, but it was shaped like a teardrop. It was very close, no more than 13 feet high and probably 100 feet away. A large flying object that close and with that shape and aura can't be some kind of man made aircraft. It only happened for about 3 seconds. I was so surprised and taken back by what I saw that I didn't even think to look at where the object was going. I just saw it float, not fly, but FLOAT past us. At first I thought I was \"seeing things\" but then I looked at my cousin and asked \"did you just see that?\" And he said, \"yeah, bluish white?\" Right after we knew that what we saw was real and that it really did hapen, I called 911 and reported the sighting."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/21/2010 03:32 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.489584,+-87.324794(26012)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26012) map </A>","Region":"Indiana","Latitude":"41.489584","Longitude":"-87.324794","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Date of the Event":"09/18/2010 09:46 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Merrillville","There were no other sightings in Merrillville on or around September 18th 2010"]}
