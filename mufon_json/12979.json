I noticed a strange object in the distance. It was muggy outside and the sky around the city had an orange hue reflecting the streetlights from the moisture in the air. looking at the object, I noticed that even thoug it was so humid outside, the object was a perfect triangle (three 60 degree angles) and it had three glowing lights near the corners ofthe triangle. although it had three lights glowing on the object, there was no illumination of the triangle. it was all black besides those lights. it was floating lazily twards the local airport. it had no flashing or landing lights. i saw it for approximately three minutes until the tree line obscured the object and i arrived at work. i felt a little nervous at the time but more of amazement than fear. I was going to write in sooner but was afraid to be ridiculed, but witholding the sighting I realized made me part of the problem than the solution."],"Latitude":"29.191549","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"03/05/2008 09:15 UTC","Case Number":"12979","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12979.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12979.html"],"Summary":"triangle hovering around Ocala","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.191549,+-82.137092(12979)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12979) map </A>","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Ocala","There were no other sightings in Ocala on or around March 5th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-10092008-0014","Date of the Event":"03/05/2008 09:15 UTC","Tags":"City"}
