I was driving north on Central Ave. when I noticed 5 large white lights to our left. For a second I thought it was lights from a plane but they were too large too close together and too low. The lights were just above the tree tops and were going north to northwest just slightly ahead of us. My daughter saw the lights also and told me they were rotating. We were both leaning forward in our seats, craning our necks to watch the lights when they disappeared. We continued north on our way home looking for the lights but did not see them again. Once we arrived home we drew pictures of the lights. I do not know what we saw but I can tell you what we did not see. we did not see an airplane,helicopter,Xmas lights, reflections from headlights etc. This happened on Friday,Nov. 16 at @645 pm."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/10/2012 11:45 UTC","Case Number":"44434","Region":"Indiana","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Summary":"We saw 5 bright large white lights to our left just above the treetops as we were traveling north .","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44434.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44434.html"]}
