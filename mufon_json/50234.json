They seemed to be spread about as wide as the Thruway. We noticed them dimly about ten degrees above the horizon; they appeared stationary as we passed beneath them. From first noticing them to going under them was less than 15 seconds, so I had no time to pull out my camera. It was deep twilight with heavy overcast (started to rain later). They were about as bright as Venus would be. The light was slightly yellowish but not big enough to see any detail (point source), and was broadly omnidirectional. They did not blink or vary in intensity. No structures were observed. I did not look out the rear window to see if they were back there as we left."],"Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Clifton Springs","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/25/2013 08:20 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/28/2013 03:39 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.96173,+-77.139976(50234)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50234) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08282013-0012"}
