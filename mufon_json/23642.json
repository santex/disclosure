Their were vertical lines of light along the side of it. At the front of the vertical lines was one green line.All the lights appeared to be a pale red color I activated my cell phone camera and quickly took one photo before it was behind the trees by my house.It was when I printed the photo on my computer and blew up the picture that you can see the round bank of lights illuminating a triangle shaped object that the lights seem to be underneath. I am sending a copy of this photo. This object appeared very quickly in the sky while I was feeding my cats. I have never seen anything like this in the sky before."],"Date Submitted":"06/06/2010 01:39 UTC","Weather Factors":"None, Medium","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-75.916975","Case Number":"23642","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Reading","There were no other sightings in Reading on or around June 4th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"40.341898","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Summary":"Round bank of lights under a triangle shaped object"}
