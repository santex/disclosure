At first I thought it was a star, but it seemed too close to be a star. While I was watching, 2 more star-like objects seemed to come from the first, to form a triangular formation. Then 2 more formed directly under these 2. These 5 bright \"stars\" held formation for what seemed to be about 5 minutes, and then all disappeared simultaneously, like someone had turned off a light switch."],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.171737,+-105.096568(20471)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20471) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/11/2009 04:45 UTC","Longitude":"-105.096568","Summary":"appearance of bright starlike objects in formation, sudden disappearance","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20471.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20471.html"],"trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Longmont","There were 3 other sightings in Longmont on or around November 10th 2009"],"Object Features":"None"}
