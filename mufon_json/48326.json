{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 9 o'clock on my way home from work I was driving on route 2 east through Franklin CT. As I came underneath the Franklin exit overpass I witnessed 6 large bright orange orbs hovering in the sky. At first I thought they were low flying planes or he≈Çicopters from the local army base a couple of towns over (east Lyme), because they were in a straight line formation. I could hear no engine noise however. For a brief moment i also mistook them as six successively lit, but not exploding, bottle rockets. As I watched them I realized they were not flying but in fact were stationary. I pulled off exit 22 about a quarter mile away and exited my car to watch these six bright orange orbs. I took video with my iPhone and captured the sighting and although you can see the orbs, they look like six bright stars instead of the bright orange orbs I saw in real time. After doing a little research I found the \"mysterious orange orb\" page on Facebook and immediately recognized them as the orange orbs I saw."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06222013-0010","Longitude":"-72.161147","Case Number":"48326","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Connecticut","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.561115,+-72.161147(48326)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48326) map </A>","Summary":"6 Large bright low flying orange orbs","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"41.561115","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Franklin","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/22/2013 11:24 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Franklin","There were no other sightings in Franklin on or around June 12th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48326.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48326.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/12/2013 09:15 UTC"}
