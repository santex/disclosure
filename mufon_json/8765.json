my first thought was that it was a big neptune helicopter (we just had the fires) with its \"spot\" on the distant 101 (me). it appeared to be just off the left of the road, on top of a hill, yet far away. i have an automatic apprehension when spotlights are trained on me since, growing up in la, it usually means a car chase is about to cross your path... so, in order to stay alive in koreatown, one must note these things. the light lingered on me for a couple minutes & then averted & began searching immediatly below it. time passed, the light got dimmer since it wasn't trained on me anymore, so i could see more detail: i could see 2 distinct shafts of light (2 huge spotlights) searching around from this point on the horizon. at this point i thought that it must be an vandenberg afb security exercise: their aircraft or a landing tower\\ beacon so i forgot about it.... 20 minutes pass, its looming ever closer. \"whoa, thats no tower, its 2000 ft off the top of the hill,\" i said out loud to myself. it was dusk, but the sky was still bright enough to clearly see a silloutte. it was huge. it was flying slowly. how slow, i don't know: a) i was driving 65 mph, b) it was following the 101, but \"crawling\" north @ what seemed like 15 mph. must be a helicopter... nope, way too big, no noise, as far as i can hear (at this point i tried to pull over, alas, there was no shoulder & no offramps for 6 or so miles... argghhh!!! figures... i slowed down to a crawl... luckily the traffic was nonexistent except for the distant lights of approaching cars from miles away; behind me and in front... must be a blimp..a freakishly huge, flat, rounded rectangle blimp... the spotlights were off when i approached along beside it... i really thought it was ours: its lights seemed to be normal aircraft lights arranged in the \"cross\" formation ( a couple lite blue strobes on top): \"what the hell are you?\" i screamed out loud... instantly (before i even finished the sentence), the huge spotlight trained on me & 2 seconds later i lost sight of it since it was directly above me... it made me so frustrated. i always wanted to see a ufo, i always thought \"if i could just see one, i'll never have doubt...\" b.s.... i saw one & i have more questions than ever... i sped ahead to the off ramp, got off & got back on racing north: i had to get a photo. waited 2 more hours in santa maria in a field until hypothermia set in.. i got back on the road. wouldn't u know it; i saw it again but this time it was at a much higher altitude (like it was mocking me!) about 3 weeks later, the very next time i was driving at dusk on the weekend (back to l.a.) the same thing happened. my father & i were driving together back to l.a. after seeing my new place. he was driving. in the same exact spot it did the same exact thing! it's m.o: it slowly cruises over the 101 freeway right next to vandenberg afb & shines its spot on one, that is, if one decides to \"greet it.\" since my dad is a staunch skeptic, i kept my mouth shut for 20 minutes as we got closer. this time , when we were about a mile away, i said, \"dad, thats a ufo...\" before pops could muster a \"gaffaw,\" the a.r.v. turned its massive spotlight on us for 2 seconds & went out again (it truly was blinding) (the big lights had been off for the whole sighting thus far). i was able to crane my head out of the passenger window long enough to really get a good long look at it from directly beneath. it was a black, rounded rectangle with detail (not smooth). to the direct aft of the ship was an illuminated area that was reminiscent of the \"aft\" hanger on a modern air craft carrier when it is open. it was hard to gauge the size of the ship since i don't know the altitude & i had no size reference... that being said, it blocked out the cobalt skies of dusk with a massive blackness; the likes of which haven't been seen since mr.t's debut in \"a-team.\" (serioulsy though, i will take a lie detector test)... but that shant be neccessary, since i have a strong inclination that this phenomena occurs every weekend @ dusk over the 101 in santa maria next to vandenberg afb. ( it has been there the last two times i have traveled that stretch at that time...) i hope anybody near there will look for themselves... perhaps the government is trying to gauge public reaction, who knows? if piloted by \"man,\" how could it react to my thoughts: i think it has something to do with the \"trip-seat\" technology from montauk lore (\"jump-room\" technology, etc). project camelot.com seems to have some very good whistleblower information for those \"ready\": i.e.: henry deacon, jim spark, gordon novel, etc testimony. anybody have any ideas how one of \"our\" \"pilots\" could \"read minds?\" please see for yourself!!!!!! i can\"t be the only one! there were hundreds of cars that saw this!!! i am going to be ready with a charged\\cued camera next time! i somehow \"know\" i will photograph this thing... just a matter of time. until then..."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01012008-0007","Region":"California","Latitude":"34.805073","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Chevron, Oval, Square, Rectagular, Other, Unknown","Summary":"EVERY WEEKEND @ DUSK!!!
