Saw a bright object moving from east to west approx. 10 degrees above horizon. The fast speed & brightness of object caught my eye. It stopped suddenly & made a dirrect turn upward then disapeared over NORAD. It made no sound & just disapeared in a clear night. I knew immediately it was a UFO as I've had many sightings since moving to Colorado Springs 27 yrs ago. I came back into my house to get my binoculars, but was unable to find anything like it in the night sky. The moon was setting approx.1:30 o'clock. Jupiter was rising approx.10:00 o'clock. This object was about 4 times larger then Jupiter & brighter then the moon. The sighting did not disturb me as I've had other sightings throughout Colorado. Did get my roommate when I got my binoculars hoping for a second opinion but the sky was devoid of anything that big & bright."],"Date of the Event":"08/26/2009 08:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18906.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18906.html"],"Case Number":"18906","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There was one other sighting in Colorado Springs on or around August 26th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"08/26/2009 08:30 UTC","Latitude":"38.842772"}
