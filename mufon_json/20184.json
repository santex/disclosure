I was layed in the bed, every night i do that, i can see airplanes passing through the window. Ive saw many planes passing, so i was used to see them passing. Last night, i was watching tv and i saw a light passing through, i thought it was an airplane, but then i saw like an orange like and then i supossed it wasnt an airplane. I saw the object carefully and i noted that it had like 9 lights turning around the object and the entire UFO was moving faster than a plane. I saw the UFO descending and waited it for raise again but nothing. I took my handycam and recorded some of the UFOs that were passing in the next minutes, they were at a far distance, so i had to use the digital zoom of the camera. I lose the sight of the object because the houses in the far hide the UFO's."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Merida","There were no other sightings in Merida on or around October 28th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Summary":"12 UFO's Globe-shape with lights","Longitude":"-89.62","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/29/2009 04:44 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"Mexico","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=20.97,+-89.62(20184)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20184) map </A>"}
