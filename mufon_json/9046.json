Well I'm thinking the morning sun is shining on the last astronamical object in our orbit or even in space. But as the sun rose , this object stayed visible. Don't forget I have a set of bi-nocs. handy! Well commensence tells me this object is in our atmosphere, fixed. With the sun rising this object really started shining and through bi-noculars it appeared spherical& metallic. As time passed and the sun was getting higher and the morning haze,and some high clouds I lost sight of what i was observing. Atmospheric conditions prevailed so the object could still be there!"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.718993","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Seminole","There were no other sightings in Seminole on or around January 19th 2008"],"Longitude":"-102.64491","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"at sunrise looking southeast up about 30 degrees was brighter than norml star-like ,spherical through bi-noculars.","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01192008-0015","Date of the Event":"01/19/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.718993,+-102.64491(9046)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9046) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9046","Date Submitted":"01/19/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","City":"Seminole"}
