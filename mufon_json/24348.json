He thought \" Iwonder what constellation that is?\" It was very hot and hazy so he was surprised to see stars so bright....that is what caught his attention...he looked at it and then it just faded away. It was in the southern sky and it did not move. He was very perplexed and came in and told me about it....I said, maybe a cloud covered it? He said no, there werent any clouds. It disapearred all at once, not gradually."],"City":"Elkton","Log Number":"US-07082010-0007","Longitude":"-75.831152","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Elkton","There were no other sightings in Elkton on or around July 7th 2010"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"39.608559","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Triangle of 3 lights.","Case Number":"24348","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Maryland"}
