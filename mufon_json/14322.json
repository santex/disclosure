Her name is Dee. She was on her back deck, smoking a cigarette, about 9:15 the night of Oct. 16, 2008. She was looking at the moon, when she noticed two bright lights in the distance, shaped like diamonds. They were side by side, and after a few, maybe ten minutes one object took off at a high rate of speed. After a couple of minutes more, the other object took off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared. She said they made no noise, and were about as large as a 8x11 sheet of paper held at arm's length. She said the sighting scared her.
