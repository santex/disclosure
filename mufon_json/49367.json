I THOUGHT THE ONLY THING THIS COULD BE WAS A UFO. IT DID NOT MOVE, THE LIGHTS WOULD SLOWLY PULSATE AND SEVERAL TIME ROTATE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. I GOT MY WIFE FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE, AND SHE WAS JUST AS AMAZED AS I WAS AND SHE ALSO OBSERVED THE LIGHTS THRU BINOCULARS. SHE SAW THE LIGHTS PULSALE AND ROTATE AND SHE COUULD ALSO SEE THINGS THAT LOOKED LIKE ELECTRICY BOLTS COMING FROM UNDERNEATH IT. WE WATCHED IT FOR 35 MINUTES, DID NOT HAVE A CAMERA WITH US THAT WEEKEND, THEN IT SLOWLY FADED AWAY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY LIGHTS IN THAT AREA BEFORE.
