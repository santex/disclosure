I went out to see how he was doing as I was having computer issues which ended up for no apparent reason . Anyway I looked up and said oh they are spraying chemtrails again and I seen this what looked like a flock of Geese , so I said check out that flock of birds they look like they are flying in a strange pattern . My stepson said not only that they are awfully high for birds , so I ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars . I came out and looked at them again and noticed that they shined sort of but were a opaque like color like a Pearl essence type of color and so I pulled the binoculars down and I said those are not birds they are some strange looking air craft and we were watching them fly across the sky when suddenly they all just disappeared ! This was this mourning and I am still freaked out by it !"],"Object Flight Path":"Other"}
