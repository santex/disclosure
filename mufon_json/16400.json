Dad has passed and Mom is 99.I have told my husband and children and grandson about it,and as far as my friend I do not know where she is,and her family are all gone now.I need to tell you about this more,I can still see it in my mind,I will never forget what I saw and I keep looking to the nite sky to see if it will come back.Please let me know if you know anything about this from texas during the summer of 1956.Thank You Sharon"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/15/1956 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around June 15th 1956"],"Date of the Event":"06/15/1956 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"29.428122","City":"San Antonio","Log Number":"US-04042009-0003","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"The most amazing thing I have ever seen, very quiet, very bright light, and very large, white, blue, red lights, the air just stood sitll.","Longitude":"-98.490268","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"16400","Object Features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface, Other","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
