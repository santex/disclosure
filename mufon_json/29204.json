We were sitting on the balcony of his house my cousin noticed a moving object in the sky, but did not mention, only after he noticed its strange shape and ���flight style��� did he point it out to me. I confirmed to him that I could see the object, it looked strange to me as well, not a plane or anything similar. The object was in a triangular shaped, made up of 8 lights. He tells me that he counted 9 lights. The lights were yellow in color, apart from the lights, there was no defined shape that I could see, partly because of the slight clouds in the sky, and ���light pollution���. The object was flying, but not in a conventionally way, that is to say as an aircraft flies, it was definitely moving, but at a slower speed, it was within our view for about 3 minutes or so before it was obscured by a building. We do not undertake in any sorts of drugs or hallucinogenics and are of sound mind. My cousin does not believe in extraterrestrial life, I am open to the possibility and am very interested, this is the first time I have ever witnessed something like this. My cousin was dismissive, whereas i was more intrigued by this, it made me feel excited, as it was obviously not something normal."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"29204","Date Submitted":"05/22/2011 08:29 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
