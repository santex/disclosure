{"Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was headed home on 70 east, and I saw wat looked like a shooting star. As I continued driving the light never faded out, like a shooting star would do. I lost sight of it for a minute, because of a treeline, but after the clearing- the one light I first saw had separated into 5 separate lights(Orbs). When I first saw it I thought it was a shooting star, but it didn't burn out like one. Then I told my fiance that it was a UFO, she told me I was tripping and that it was so aircraft performing from the Aircraft Show that was here. I said not this late at night. Bottomline, I was surprised to witness a event like this in Kansas City. I saw a sighting in Arizona, that was similiar but it was five lights that were in a diagonal line and they just hovered and then disappeared."],"Case Number":"31130","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-98.478796","Summary":"It looked like a shooting star, and separated into 5 separate orbs","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31130.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31130.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.019972","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":[],"Date of the Event":"08/19/2011 09:45 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.019972,+-98.478796(31130)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31130) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/24/2011 09:36 UTC","Region":"Kansas","Log Number":"US-08242011-0008"}
