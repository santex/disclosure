Soon enough we witnessed things we had never seen before. At one point in the night i was scared for my life. These things were floating about 1 mile away from us. All we could see were the lights but this picture lit up enough to see the actual objects! We saw at least 15 UFO's that night and they were blatantly not aircrafts of this world. We stayed on my roof until the sun came out and they were still out. My camera soon died after this picture, but i thought it was good enough evidence to throw off anyone who did not believe in these things."],"Country":"United States"}
