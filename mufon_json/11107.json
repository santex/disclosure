she said she screamed hysterically \"where is my baby?!,where is my baby?!\" and a \"doctor\" replies \"what baby?,\"you were never pregnant\". i was immediately reminded of this because it sounds just like many alien-abduction stories that i've heard.that friday nite that this whole reptilian encounter took place i was sleeping rite next 2 my wife.she said in this \"dream\" or encounter me my older brother and a host of other people she has never seen before were present with her but we stood motionless and expressionless as if we were \"frozen in time\". she described this creature as having big black eyes with lizard-like skin, facial features resembling a snake but the mouth never moved and was more of a straight line then a mouth.she said only the creature's head was visible.i recall that that saturday morning before my wife even remembered this whole crazy episode me and my wife were very very tired but not like normal.i work construction, i know what it is to be tired! i work 8hrs 6 days every week with no vacation! this wasn't normal we both felt like we've been drugged.the next day my wife had 3 little punture maks inside what looked like a pimple.she was in pain for a bit and got a real nasty period! after my wife told me all of this i instantly started searching the web to see what i could find out about these creatures,alien contact and or abduction and i read somewhere that these \"things\" have a thing for snatching babies from women with the o-negative blood type. my wife is an o-negative blood type! i heard these reptilian aliens supposedly have underground bases here in los angeles,new mexico,mexico,texas,central america...and so on which is pretty eerie considering me and my wife live in los angeles county and my wife's ancestors come from central america ( el salvador). but besides all the similarities between my wife's contact case and others and everything i've read on the net and in magazines the most eerie thing to me is #1-- 2 weeks prior to this encounter me and my step-son saw a triangle shaped ufo fly over the apartment building i'm living in here in reseda,ca. #2-- a week after my sighting, my older brother called me saying he spotted a square looking ufo by his house in mission hills,ca. #3-- i think the biggest thing for me is the fact that prior to meeting my wife i never really cared for the whole ufo\\alien phenomenon my wife didn't either. but since i've been with my wife ( 2 years now ) i've had a few ufo sightings prior to this event. i saw a few strange looking lights in the sky over my apartment in van nuys,ca maybe a year and a half ago( definitely between 2006-2007 ).that same year on a trip to las vegas,nevada saw a huge weird looking assortment of lights while on the freeway. and another sighting on a trip to utah i snapped a picture of a ufo while i was snapping shots of mountains and other scenery.and now this year my wife has an encounter with an alien?!! i have to admit, when i was first told about this whole thing that my wife experienced i thought she was just screwing with me because i was interested in ufos and she isn't ( she's very religious ) but when she started describing things i didn't even know about i started to believe her. it would make all my sightings in the past year or so make a little more sense.maybe she is the connection! if there's anything you know about these reptilian aliens please e-mail me back!!!! this whole thing has me a little spooked!! thanks for listening!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11107.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11107.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/06/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"11107","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
