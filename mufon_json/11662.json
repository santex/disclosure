I immediately woke up my family and showed this thing to them. We could not figure it out, I watched it for over a 30 minutes and it didnt move so it wasnt a airplane or helicopter. Now the most common answer to this is that its just a star and the red I was seeing is just the solar flares. Although this wasnt at the altitude of all the other stars and in fact i saw the exact same object farther from where i was flying at the same altitude. I really want to figure at what this thing was and i wouldnt be surprised if anyone else saw it. It was very bright and stayed up there for over an hour. After watching the object for over and hour i thought i was going to have a seisure with the pulsating lights. I tried to rest my eyes for a little bit and then wake up when it was lighter out to see what this thing was. Unfortanetly i feel asleep."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.962185","Date Submitted":"07/21/2008 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around July 21st 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07212008-0007","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"11662","Date of the Event":"07/21/2008 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.962185,+-75.160409(11662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11662) map </A>","Disposition":"Hoax","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Philadelphia"}
