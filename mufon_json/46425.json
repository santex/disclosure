I was sitting at a mandatory stop in Deer Valley at the snow Park Lodge. I usually will get out and wait for my time point to leave, so i was standing and leaning against the wall facing down Deer Valley when a light ascended over the hill. It was flashing red, white, blue and at first i thought it was a helicopter, since Life Flight is a constant thing to see here. I love to watch and listen to helicopters fly, that is why i noticed it. but then it shot across the skyline, stopped on a dime, shot up, stopped, and then shot again at an angle towards Salt Lake City where i lost sight of it as it went out of sight. The sighting lasted no more than 30 seconds, but i do know what i saw. There is no way we have technology capable of that. I have seen other strange aeronautical things around this area."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46425.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46425.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-111.478452","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.640417,+-111.478452(46425)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46425) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO over Park City, shot across the sky in ways that modern technology can not do","Date of the Event":"01/12/2013 09:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Park City","There were no other sightings in Park City on or around January 12th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"46425","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Park City","Country":"United States"}
