At first I didn't think much of them but then I realized I saw these lights four days before driving home from a movie. This time I show them to my family and they told me I was crazy and that they were just airplanes. But they were way too bright to be airplanes and they were staitionary. I tried to take a picture with my Mom's phone but It didn't turn out too well. As we were driving south the lights seemed to get brighter. I saw these lights for about 15 minutes, but when I came out of Friendly's they were gone again. My family was starting to think I'm not soo crazy. This experience is just like my last... If you've had an experience similar to this contact me at brightlightsoverboston@gmial.com. These lights had a possible disk shape to them and were about 3 miles away. Wierd... I looked it up on a star chart and they were not stars..."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Needham","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Needham","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Second sighting of 2 wierd bright lights in four days!
