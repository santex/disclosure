Right after the jet passed by I saw a round white orb stationary in the sky. I watched it move slowly toward the east but as I watched I saw two other orbs, one further away and one closer. After about two to three minutes two of the orbs moved off but the one that was closer stayed in the same position. Just then two sivler grey orbs approached the white orb; they were flying together then split apart to go around the white orb and then rejoined after they passed and moved off toward the east. I began walking around the building at the same time watching the orb and it never moved, but stayed in the same place. I had to glance down for a moment but when I looked back up the orb was gone. There was no one with me at the time."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-06192009-0023","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Aurora","There was one other sighting in Aurora on or around June 19th 2009"],"Case Number":"17564"}
