{"Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving home from my friends house on highway 78 in snellville\\grayson. then i turned left on grayson pkwy and i noticed about 15 to 20 bright orange spheres in a line above the trees to my right. i pulled into my driveway and ran to my backyard and could now only see about 4 or 5 of them. they had changed patterns. they were circling each other. they kept getting lower until it was almost like they disappeared. it was hard to say how far away they were. from the time i got in my backyard they were gone within 3 minutes or so. when i first noticed them i thought it was possibly some lights from a cell tower but then they starting moving. i woke my husband up and we sat outside for a few hours but they did not return."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Grayson","There were no other sightings in Grayson on or around May 28th 2010"],"Region":"Georgia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.894273,+-83.95574(23507)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23507) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23507.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23507.html"],"Weather Factors":"Lightning, Light","Latitude":"33.894273","Longitude":"-83.95574","Object Shape":"Diamond, Disc","Date of the Event":"05/28/2010 09:15 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05282010-0016","Date Submitted":"05/28/2010 10:19 UTC","Case Number":"23507","Tags":"City","Summary":"15 to 20 bright orange lights above the trees..
