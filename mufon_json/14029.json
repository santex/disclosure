I saw a streak of light enter from directly in front of me from east to west. It looked like debris that was on fire and breaking up as it came across my view. I could see small parts coming off of the main streak. It seems as though is was breaking apart as it moved closer to the ground. I am an amateur astronomer and have witnessed many meteor showers in the past. This may have been just that but it seemed to be different that what I had seen in the past. I would be interested to know if anyone else saw the same or if it was even reported."],"City":"Houston","Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-95.36123","Log Number":"US-11252008-0036","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were 2 other sightings in Houston on or around November 21st 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/21/2008 07:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14029.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14029.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"29.766193","Case Number":"14029","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Texas"}
