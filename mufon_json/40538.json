In the last year I have never gone on a walk at night, none the less the day. I just had this sudden urge, and I had to go. I walked around the block and as I came around to my street which is A street Springfield Oregon I noticed towards the North Eastern Sky I noticed a GIANT RED-ISH ORANGE-ISH ORB in the sky, IT WAS PHUCKING HUGE, way too big, I mean, it looked like a small fire in the sky. It was kinda pulsating, and I could tell it wasn't moving because the stars behind it, which dwarfed in comparison referenced the orb as to not moving. What I mean to say is, the orb and the stars were stationary. They weren't moving. But the orb was pulsating, and I began to freak out because I wanted someone to see it too. So I ran back 50 feet to where I saw someone getting groceries out of their trunk but they had already gone inside their apartment. So I ran back to the street and the ORB was still there. A man was getting in his jeep, well he was putting stuff in his jeep, but getting ready to go there was a lady in the driver seat with the engine on. I yelled at him \"hey do you see that there, do you see that?!!!\" He first said no, and as I pointed towards the sky, towards this HUGE RED-ISH ORANGE-ISH ORB THAT WAS WAYYYYY UP in the sky, but was way to big to be something we could familiarize ourselves with, and that's when he said \"Yea...Yea I do see that\" I told him \"WATCH, IT'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR\" and after about fifteen seconds the orb kinda dipped, but it was so far up there, it was a big move, and then it shot into space, I mean, it went out of our atmosphere, it slowly turned into a small dot which was eventually gone into the stars. I looked back at the man and said \"see you just saw your first UFO now go study\" He didn't say anything back to me."],"Region":"Oregon","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Springfield","There was one other sighting in Springfield on or around July 3rd 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.046788,+-123.014376(40538)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40538) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-123.014376","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.046788","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Had the urge to go outside, never done that before.
