I actually saw a plane fly under it. i dont think it was that . it freaked me out. because i was watching it for 5 mins. no repeated moves, then all of the sudden it took form, it connected the bright star to the dim star, and it was moving east!it was not triangle shape. i thought it was a stealth blimp but that changed my mind on it. i tried to show my friend 1 friend saw one star moving. i watched it again, the bright star was circling around the dimmer star real fast and it disapeared into the dimmer star! i saw another star on the right that was also kinda dim, it wint into the dim star!! i was freakinng out.. i dont know what that is. i know for sure that wasnt the space station!"],"Region":"California","Date of the Event":"07/16/2009 02:20 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/16/2009 02:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.780981,+-119.414642(18128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18128) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":[]}
