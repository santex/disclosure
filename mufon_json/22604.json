The weather was so nice this morning that I decided to prop my front door open and have a smoke outside my office this morning. While enjoying my smoke and watching the clouds move rapidly North, I saw a contrail from what I at first thought to be an airplane. Looking closer I noticed something wasn't quite right so I grabbed my 10 x 50 binoculars to take a closer look. I observed the contrail moving rapidly and consistently from North to South but there was nothing that I could visibly see that was creating the trail The trail seemed to be appearing out of thin air, there was no aircraft. The event lasted only a few minutes. There were two separate cloud layers this morning and the event was occurring below the top layer."],"Longitude":"-97.14136","Latitude":"31.551213","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.551213,+-97.14136(22604)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22604) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Waco","There were no other sightings in Waco on or around April 1st 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22604.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22604.html"],"Log Number":"US-04012010-0018"}
