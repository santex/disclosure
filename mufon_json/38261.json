This particular evening,(I think it was Wed.evening,but it might have been another night (The date and time should be part of the digital info however) Any way as i was looking north west to watch for the sun set,an object which appeared to be a black orb,with a flaming bottom streaked over my head from out over the Gulf,headed inland . I pointed my camera at it,and zoomed the lens,and snapped a picture,before the object was beyond my sight. There was no sound at all . I have no idea how high the object was,but it appeared to be about airplane height ."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38261.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38261.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere"}
