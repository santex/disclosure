There was a blinking white light coming from the north east heading south west. What caught my attention was that this wasn't blinking like an airplane every second. It would blink only about every 30 seconds, much brighter than a normal airplane. After blinking 4 or 5 times as is crossed the night sky, it lit up to a solid white dot much brighter than a star, slowed down and stopped. My wife and I watched this thing closely for the next 2 hours. We saw multiple orbs come and go from the bottom of whatever this light was. It seemed to roll and turn occasionally. There were red lights on each side of it that would blink very quickly about once every 60 seconds. It only moved about an inch at arm���s length from side to side slowly about twice while it was visible. This was not a star. This was not a satellite or a planet. This thing lit up and stopped in the sky and stayed there, looking like a planet. Our dogs, the neighbor���s dogs, the neighbor���s donkey and the coyotes were all barking and braying at the same time it first appeared as a solid light. The light never moved much after that. It just drifted behind the tree line like the rest of the stars."],"Region":"Oregon","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/14/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.966986"}
