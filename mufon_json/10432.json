My neighbors shot off some big mortars, and about five minutes after it was over, here comes two glowing spheres one yellowish white and the other completely red. They where definitely separate objects and were moving faster than all of the regular air traffic that are always up in the sky, \"I live right next to an airport\". When the objects passed my house with no sound the red one split into three all of which were red and glowed dimmer until they vanished. The cream colored one didn't, and when the cream one was way off in the distance , the red one reappeared. Not being a good parent I said WTF. This could have been a scene from a science fiction movie but it really happened. Earlier that day I saw something metallic hanging over the city but what happened at night was definitely cool."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-77.408041","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10432.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10432.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10432.html"],"Object Features":"None","Summary":"Two fairly fast moving different color,\"one cream and one red\" buzzed my nieghborhood after private fireworks display.
