Before I go inside from a long night I look up at the stars but this night was cloudy so on only the moon was showing through a hole in the clouds. I'm not sure what is was at first it was something very large and not organic and it was dead quite out side. The object was a dark shadowy v shaped UFO no light or sound. And it just glided pass the moon as I looked up. It was very smooth passover if it was not for the break in the clouds I would have not seen it. I was very excited about seen this object fly passed over me. It was like watching an 747 fly right above you. I lost sight of the object as it flew into the opposite end of the clouds then it started to rain. Every thing happened so fast I have no proof of what I saw only my word."],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2010 05:58 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"None"}
