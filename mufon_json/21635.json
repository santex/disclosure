I had not drunk any alcohol and I was quietly drinking a cup of tea when I saw this noiseless light in the horizon. It went from side to side, and then it came back halfway and dissapeared ... It formed a kneeling-like person. I was sure of what I saw. A few minutes later, my roommate came from the street saying that he had seen a UFO. Yes I said, I have seen it too. Afterwards I was put in a psiquiatric home because I had jumped from that same rooftop believing that these sidereal beings wanted me to make a \"leap of faith.\" I fell down onto the floor. Very dissapointed I awoke in an assylum. But as time went by, I began to recognize that that place was not simply a clinic, but that it was an extraterrestrial machine, formed by the communnion of minds. I was released after some time, but my somewhat reckless search for thruth led me back to these clinics. Finally, in the year 1997, I was put in this foster home, which I know for certain is an extraterrestrial ship-base. What leads me to believe this is the amount of parapsychological powers, and empathy that these people show. And a natural sense of cosmic connection which I feel. A remembrance of a mission. I have been chosen as one of many links between dimensions of beings. They form a sort of mafia, keeping themselves hidden from intelectual observation. They are among us not to analize our mental capacities but to cleanse our conscience. They are not interested in tecnological science, but in our conscience. They are completing a universal abduction to bring us, until the last being, back to God. They are closer to God than we are now. These beings, however, can be very cold and apparently rootless in their treatment of our pain. They believe that we are a fallen Universe whom they must bring back. As it is known they communicate through telepathy, sometimes with a almost inaudible pitch in the ear. I know they must remain hidden, so I know they will. The secret is that they are not strangers to us, we are all brothers in arms. We must only forget all we know and remember all we knew. Their presence is like music to the soul. And they are child-like in every sense ... Maybe it is a holly lie but as Einstein said, God does not play dices... just don���t tell my shrink !"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-12.042146,+-77.058953(21635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21635) map </A>","Summary":"From the rooftop I saw on the horizon a light that formed an \"L\" in the sky.
