I looked up at the stars like I always do and was looking at Orion.....I noticed that it had 2 extra stars in it and started to think it was not Orion.....I told my kids to go inside and I showed my husband (who is a non believer in anything like this). I pointed to the 2 \"stars\" that started getting brighter and a little larger than the star that were in Orion. I started getting scared I thought maybe they would get closer since they were getting so bright, then it was like they stopped then went so fast in the opposite direction. In a matter of 2 seconds they were completly gone."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"03/08/2012 12:08 UTC","Longitude":"-82.903323","Latitude":"32.162295","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.162295,+-82.903323(36327)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36327) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03082012-0009","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36327.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Georgia"}
