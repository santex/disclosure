I thought it was star but then i told myself it can't be stars when they all are in the same section of the sky and moving at the same time. At the time it was already 9:37pm and I called my husband to let him know. He said he was taken care of the baby and then he will go out. By the time i was not the only one there on the side of the road I seen another car also stop on the road I think he was also looking at them. I never had seen that in my life. I'm not what exactly it is. I tried to take a picture but it doesn't show anything. So I decided to go back home and tell him to get out it started to fade away with the clouds. My husband got out when he call and stated he didn't see anything. Also it was raining at the time but had stop when I saw the sightings.
