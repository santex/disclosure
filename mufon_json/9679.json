Some of them are silent, and the silent ones are closely accompanied by other lowflying, very loud aircraft, a tactic doubtlessly used to hide the silence of the former. I have noticed little white orbs darting about near some of the crafts as well. And they're everywhere. As soon as one makes it's way to the horizon, two or three more appear from other directions. I've talked to many observant people who have been watching these aircraft, and everyone agrees that it is very strange. I'd say most people don't care enough to notice, or are simply to distracted by their own amusements to stop and wonder. People look at me like I'm crazy when I stop in the street to observe the crafts. I'd love to connect with other aware Austinites regarding this phenomenon. My email is thetansbeware@yahoo.com"]}
