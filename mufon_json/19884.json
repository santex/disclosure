It was white, had a long triangular shape and absolutely no sound. We couldn't tell how high it was since we had never seen anything like it before my guess would be 10,000 to 20,000 ft. It moved smoothly and rapidly in a direct heading. I can't calculate the size of it because it seemed to be high in the sky. I can tell you right now that we watched this object and it left us both questioning what it could be."],"Summary":"white long triangular shape"}
