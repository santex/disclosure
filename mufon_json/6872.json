My friend, Hailey Siple, was in the back. Chillin', ya know. Her hair was getting messed up, so she put a plastic bag on her head. I was wearing a top hat. It was about 1:30 PM. We were driving down the highway on our way to the lake. As we approached Wal-Mart, a shiny, disk-like object in the sky caught my eye. I pointed it out to Shane, who laughed and told me that it was just a Russian spy plane. duh. I stared at it for what seemed like forever, but then as we were passing Wal-Mart, it shot off at about, say, 3,000,000 mph behind the Wal-Mart, never to be seen again. I looked in the back to say something ot Hailey, but ...duh duh duh duh.....SHE WASN'T THERE!!! We were concerned at first, but then we continued to drive to the lake, where we found her IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE!!!
