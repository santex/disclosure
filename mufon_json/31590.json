I was facing southeast and in my peripheral vision I noticed something at first I thought was a shooting star. When I focused my eyes on it I saw it was a V shaped formation of lights moving in the manner of an airplane towards the southeast. The lights were about the same size, color and brightness as the surrounding stars. I thought it odd that it made no sound. I observed it for about 2 seconds before it went out of my sight beyond some trees. Never having seen anything like this before, I have no reference as to the size, height or speed of the object. I would guess it was some type of aircraft but have never observed a plane that made no sound before. Initially I was unnerved by the sighting, but I wonder if it could have been a Stealth or some other type of military craft. I would like to know if there's any possibility of a Stealth flying over this area?"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.169674","Region":"Minnesota","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Coon Rapids","There were no other sightings in Coon Rapids on or around September 3rd 2011"],"Case Number":"31590","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.169674,+-93.293313(31590)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31590) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Observed V shaped light formation travelling silently across sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/06/2011 04:47 UTC","Country":"United States"}
