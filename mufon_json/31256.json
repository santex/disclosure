It was roughly 10:00 p.m. and there were about a dozen of us there. I was facing northeast when I noticed what appeared to be several satellites moving through the sky from different directions. As they moved closer to each other, I became aware that there were 4 of these lights. I really did not think much of it until the lights moved even closer to each other and then began circling around each other, as if they were moving in formation. I���ve never seen satellites do this, but shrugged it off. Then, they all suddenly and simultaneously streaked across the night sky at speeds I���ve never seen before, once again in totally different directions. They did not make any discernible sounds. They moved so fast they were out of sight within a second. Two of my friends and I jumped up at the same time shouting ���oh my god, did you see that?!��� It was as if they had moved at the speed of light! To this day, I have never heard of any known flying object that can move at such speeds."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Orleans","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"4 star-like moving objects come from different directions in sky, then circle around each other before taking off in different directions at unearthly speed.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08282011-0021"}
