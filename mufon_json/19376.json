Was attracted to turn head to left and up by (?) to see bright star (as bright as Venus) like object that was traveling west to east with no sound or blinking lights but very light tail - wife also observed as I called her out to observe. We watched it take a straight course East and disappear near tree level. Appeared high and traveling fast. I then looked back and there was another (tree line to 180) on same course. This one however appeared to veer slightly but stayed on course to again fade away at tree line. Lighting was steady and star like with no other colors presented. Nothing further noticed so suspecting space station and shuttle if in area. No pictures taken or others contacted."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19376.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/18/2009 07:25 UTC"}
