Upon looking up I saw a chevron shaped light source. As the object became close the object was not single but several amber lights in a loose formation. Some of the amber objects changed position but as a whole remained in the chevron shape. The object, or objects were high altitude, leaving not trail or emitting no sound. the number of objects appeared to be anywhere from 30 to 35 individual amber lights. Encounter time was 30 to 40 seconds allowing time to judge direction and approximate count. I am familiar with various aircraft types, satellite observations, meteor showers and various astronomical object locations. I have never witnessed anything of this size, number and formation."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32607.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32607.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"30-350amber objects in chevron formation.","Date Submitted":"10/15/2011 08:54 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.514184,+-82.860158(32607)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32607) map </A>"}
