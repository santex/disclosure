(both of those sightings were in october of this year, a couple of weeks apart). aside from these incidents, i have never had any knowm contact with ufos or aliens."],"Log Number":"US-11282011-0030","Summary":"4 hovering light orbs that formed triangle, then changed pattern","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.669309,+-81.356964(33689)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33689) map </A>","Case Number":"33689","Latitude":"28.669309","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.356964","Date of the Event":"11/20/2011 08:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Altamonte Springs","There were no other sightings in Altamonte Springs on or around November 20th 2011"],"City":"Altamonte Springs","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
