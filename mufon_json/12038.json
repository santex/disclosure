As I looked at it ,it was traveling very fast,in a straight horizontal line.At first I thought it was a meteor falling out of the sky.But that's just it, it wasn't falling out of the sky it was traving in a horizontal angle across the sky, and then it stopped inside a cloud and the cloud lit up like an explosion,with these blue,purple,and green colors.As the clouds began to part,i could see the object was still in position,except now it camoflauged itself to look like a bright star.These beings like to use the clouds to mirror their image in daylight aswell as night.I dont know what's about to happen, but what ever it is,these things are setting the stage for contact..Remember watch the skies,because the skies are watching us all.."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12038.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12038.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"08/11/2008 09:23 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-97.842893","Object Shape":"Flash","Latitude":"30.081723","Source":"MUFON","City":"Buda","Date Submitted":"08/11/2008 09:23 UTC","Log Number":"US-08122008-0003","Summary":"A flash of light exploded inside a cloud and it wasnt lightning!"}
