{"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and neighbors were in my front yard watching fireworks that I was lighting. The Police Department showed up and I went to the end of the driveway to talk to them. They left a few minutes later and we were all standing in my front yard when one of my neighbors pointed towards the north in the sky and said \"Look at the orange glow\". It moved from the northwest, behind my house going towards the south. It appeared to be below cloud level, this was hard to tell since it was a very clear night with only one or two small clouds in the sky but the moon was shining very bright. The orange orb moved at a speed that I have only seen from watching the International Space Station go by. This orb made no noise at all. The orb was glowing an orange but not flashing. There were no flashing lights on it at all like you see on airplanes. I was in the Navy for 4 years and have seen helicopters, jets, etc. all fly at night and this orange orb is something of its own. There were 8 adults and 6 children that all witnessed this."],"Summary":"Orange Orb","Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17896.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17896.html"],"Region":"Connecticut","Longitude":"-72.646839","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Middletown","There were no other sightings in Middletown on or around July 4th 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 09:50 UTC","Latitude":"41.566241","Log Number":"US-07072009-0002","Case Number":"17896","City":"Middletown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.566241,+-72.646839(17896)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17896) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 09:50 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
