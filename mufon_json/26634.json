There was a large sphere that was glinting in the sun just like the plane was, it was above the plane and that is what I was watching - when all of a sudden I saw what looked like an electrical arc shoot from the spehere to the plane and stay there for a few seconds, then dissapear. It is the strangest thing I've ever seen. The plane kept going as if it was unaffected by the event, then the sphere moved quickly up and away and out of my sight."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","City":"Independence","Log Number":"US-11172010-0016","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/17/2010 09:58 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/04/2010 11:30 UTC","Case Number":"26634","Longitude":"-94.413697","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around November 4th 2010"],"Latitude":"39.099286","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.099286,+-94.413697(26634)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26634) map </A>","Summary":"Electrical arc between jet and sperical object","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
