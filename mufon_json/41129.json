Within a second the object was flying in the same direction as we were traveling and had obviously gained intense momentum as it was now a few miles ahead of us. I thought the object was a plane that was going to crash at first but the way it was moving was odd especially with no sound and its apparent size, seeing it further down the highway (but in the sky) was surprising. The object moved very rapidly out of sight while ascending."],"Region":"Massachusetts","Latitude":"42.104572","Case Number":"41129","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.104572,+-72.247551(41129)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41129) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/25/2012 12:46 UTC","Object Shape":"Diamond, Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07252012-0002","Source":"MUFON","City":"Brimfield","Summary":"Kite Shaped Object moving at high speed in an extremely unusual trajectory over Brimfield Ma","Date of the Event":"07/25/2012 10:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.247551","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41129.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41129_submitter_file1__Untitled1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41129.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41129.html"]}
