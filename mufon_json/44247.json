I thought it was a plane or an antenna but it seemed much too high up to be an antenna, and it wasn't moving, just hovering and gently pulsing. I drove past a few buildings and tried to look at it from a different angle to try and figure out what it was, but it was gone. This was between 9:12-9:15PM. I'd be interested if anyone else saw it, maybe for a longer period so I know I'm not just seeing things with an overactive imagination."],"Latitude":"41.255946","Case Number":"44247","City":"Omaha","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11302012-0001","Summary":"Glowing, pulsating red-orange orb appeared for a few seconds, I drove by a few buildings and then it was gone.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around November 29th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"11/30/2012 12:20 UTC","Region":"Nebraska","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.255946,+-96.173912(44247)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44247) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.173912"}
