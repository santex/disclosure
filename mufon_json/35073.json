After about 45 min. and the kids getting board we decided to go in. We got up and I looked up one last time to scane the night sky I seen a shape going West from East. I pointed this out to my kids to make shure I was not seeing things. Only 3 of my kids seen it to. The UFO was clear, like looking through a glass of water, it disstorted the stars behind it, it had no lights, no sound, and no heat trails. Thiis was moving at a good speed. My oldest son told his mother that it looked like the bat-wing. It did kind of. I know airplans and this was no aircraft like I have ever seen."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/23/2012 05:05 UTC"}
