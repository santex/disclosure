I take random snapshots of the sky frequently. I didn't notice anything unusual until I had downloaded the photos into my computer. I am enclosing the original photo where there is a chemtrail (I think) and above that is the object in question. In the upper right part of the photo is a hawk which I left in because the original photo is untouched. In the other photo is the object that I greatly enlarged. I did not focus or do anything else to the photo. Feel free to do anything to the original you want for your own analysis.
