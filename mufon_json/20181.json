{"Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsone week after the fourth of july, lots of explosions....thought it was another fireworks display over cass lake but fireworks were not visible as they usally can be seen over the trees. i was glad when the booms stopped.....not a fireworks fan. i was online or watching tv near a window when i saw what appeard to be sparklers......it was like looking at a campfire through the trees........tree leaves blocked most of the light so it appeard to be some kind of sparkler or fireworks, but all noise had stopped before the sparkling appeard. the sparkles rose higher in the trees, and a growing bubble of orange light through and over the trees.....(pardon grammatical errors, trying to be coherent and accurate here)..the light was like the light from a fire that was growing rapidly.....almost like the initial round, glowing, and growing explosion of a nuke weapon but no smoke, and again...no sound. then the thing appeared above the tree line.........three bright orange headlights\\floodlights. the lights were distintly kept from illuminating upward. the whole neighborhood was lit up from the thing. it slowly ascended then turned eastward......approx 100 feet off the ground before it started turning eastward and it continued to rise to maybe one thousand feet as it moved eastward, speed also seemed to increase steadily. i could not make out the shape of the objett, but it appeared to have lighted windows on the back side as it moved away. i estimated the size according to the span of the crown of the trees it rose above when i first saw it. that's all.....no lights pointed directly at me, no abduction, just sooooo weird because the thing was silent and the lights were so broad and oddly colored orange......maybe a little less orange than flames of fire, but very close......when i saw a campfire through the woods once after the inc3ident, i pointed it out to a friend as it loooked very similar to the lights of the strange craft when i first saw it. when i first saw it i thought it was a helicopter, but it was silent. then i thought it must be a balloon or blimp, but it seemed to move too fast as it headed east. i was quite awestuck and a little scared, but the thing had no notice or interest in me which i was glad for. the thing disappeared in the distance after moving a mile or two in less than one minute, too fast for a blimp. the object must have been about twenty feet in height(estimating by the size of the headlights\\floodlights, and fifty feet wide. the wooded area is behind a school. i did not examine the area...yet...for signs on the ground. people think i\"m crazy anyways.....if i find nothing there, that's just more reason to think i'm crazy. didn't bother to look, i know what i saw."],"Latitude":"42.695304","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","City":"Waterford","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.695304,+-83.404253(20181)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20181) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10292009-0006","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20181.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20181.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"20181","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Waterford","There were no other sightings in Waterford on or around July 21st 2009"],"Date of the Event":"07/21/2009 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/29/2009 11:39 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"three bright orange headlights/floodlights, approx 50 feet wide, silent., ascended out of woods, extremely bright lights illuminated a quarter mile circle before rising and then heading east.","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-83.404253"}
