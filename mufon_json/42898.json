I have no idea what the object was, but it appeared to have no wings or fins and was not emitting a contrail like a jet does at a high altitude. The object was ascending from SW to NE in a straight line. My only reaction is curiosity that something that high in a cold atmosphere would leave no contrail. Afterwards I went back to work, no afterthought except curiosity. I lost sight of the object when it went into the clouds. Cloud tops were high approximately 25,000 ft. Object would appear the size of a baby aspirin at arms length.1"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42898.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42898.html"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Wheeling","There were no other sightings in Wheeling on or around September 29th 2012"],"Latitude":"40.069132","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.717905","Case Number":"42898","Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 04:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Wheeling","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09292012-0022","Region":"West Virginia"}
