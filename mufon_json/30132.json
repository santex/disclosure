Before I turned the light on, I noticed a greenish light in the woods behind my home. I ran downstairs and grabbed binoculars, through which I clearly viewed a group of circular lights. They were greenish yellow and seemed to be blinking slowly.I watched for about ten minutes before the l ights blinked off and faded into the trees. My father saw the same craft at about 930 the previous night, and watched it through binoculars for nearly an hour. Neither of us is easily scred, but these sightings have rendered us nearly incapable of sleep."],"Longitude":"-75.654162","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Scranton"}
