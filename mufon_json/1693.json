I am an internationally-publishedcultural anthropologist researching the diffusion in ancient times of T-shapedtemples and tombs (a global phenomenon). A report reached me concerning thesighting in Bangalore earlier this year (I think) of a T-shaped UFO seen by twoengineers from a rooftop. Can you confirm? This is the only way I could think ofto ask this question, so I hope you wont be too put out. Also, I was told thata lady reported being abducted and had some small T-shaped objects removed fromher foot on TV (perhaps on Sightings). Can you confirm?
