I used the church's cross at the front of the church to determine movement. Its movement was so slow, that without reference, you would not notice any (I have observed and photographed the ISS, it was not a satellite). It seemed to move west slightly, then east slightly. A jet flew by at about 30,000 near the object... the object appeared to be at least 4 time the altitude (maybe higher). the object moved south (about the with of my fist at arms length) and disappeared. Another star like object was noticed (about half as bright) at the origin of the first object). By then, church was starting and we went indoors. The object(s) was self illuminous or really high up to reflect the sun. The area of the sky was facing east, up about a 60 degree angle (I can measure it more accurately if needed). Mercury, Venus and Saturn were at about 110 degrees and not visible at that time of day.
