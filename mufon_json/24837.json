I look up in the sky and I see a oval shaped disc that seemed moderatly large and very shiny like aluminum. It also apeared that it had two light sorces from my perspective. Then after 5-10 seconds a tree blocked my view for 3 seconds and the object vanished. There was nothing in sight, I looked for planes or anything. Nothing was there, at the location I saw it. It wasn't traveling fast either, it was just hovering, apearing to stay in place. It almost seemed as if it knew I was looking, then when it had it's chance vanished. The object was pretty far away as well, it was farther away than for me to see it with any detail. All I could see was it's shape, luster, and light source."],"Longitude":"-118.117012","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"24837","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"07/29/2010 12:54 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash, Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24837.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24837.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/29/2010 04:16 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.881682","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"California","Summary":"I saw it for 5-10 seconds and then after I passed a tree it was gone.","City":"Bellflower","Log Number":"US-07292010-0019"}
