It was triangular, about the size of my small fingernail held at arm's length. No running lights and I noticed it did eclipse the stars in the background night sky as it moved over them. It was a dark brown or grey color, maybe from the reflected city lights. No sound, I knew I did not have enough time to get my camera so I just sat there for about 1 minute as it disappeared over my house to the east. Camp Pendleton is about 15 miles due west of me so my guess is that it came from there. I have never seen an aircraft like that and have been to many airports all over the world including some military."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-119.413382","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12354.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.780581","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/02/2008 10:00 UTC","City":"Sam Marcos","Log Number":"US-09052008-0004","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Eastbound, very slow, no lights, Triangular","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.780581,+-119.413382(12354)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12354) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"12354","Source":"MUFON"}
