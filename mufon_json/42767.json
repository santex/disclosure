Saw an object that appeared to be a circular or oval shape. It was extremely bright at times. So bright you couldn't look at it head on. It was like a hot air balloon on fire. Very bright and intense, like a burning ball of gas.It was amber colored, sometimes different colors it twinkled. Not sure what it was. Traveled from the NW to the SW. Chandged direction a few times, seemed to float around and hovered a bit. Then we lost sight of it as it ascended upward diagonally to the SW. Sighting lasted 30 sec. to a minute long. It was definatley intelligently controlled. It was about 35 degrees above the horizon, about 5 to 10 km away. The sky was clear with a very mild wind. It was huge, about the size of a golf ball. I was very excited. Freaked out. I was in awe wondering what it was. Had an uneasy feeling. Sighting was something that changes your life. It was definatley not man made. I went to the police station and nobody reported any sightings. No mention in the local papers the next day."],"Date of the Event":"07/11/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/23/2012 04:38 UTC","Case Number":"42767","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.790764,+-81.383787(42767)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42767) map </A>","Region":"Ontario"}
