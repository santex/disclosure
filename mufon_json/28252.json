I saw large triangle in the sky with a large light in the middle, 3 lights on the outside, and a small flare out the back. I thought it was a flying low but then realized how slow it was going. When I told my friend to look up he didn't believe me, when he finally looked up it vanished. I had no reaction to the mysterious object other than more proof that there is life out there. I always carried a camera with me after that sighting, next time I will get footage with my 1080p camera."]}
