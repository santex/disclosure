{"Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I stopped south of Fulton, NY for a nature call. I looked into the sky and saw an organge cigar shaped object moving slowly from the north. The object stopped and a piece of the same color fell from it and burst into flames. The object then left in the same direction it came from. When I first saw it I said to my friend \"look at this thing.\" My friend blew it off as nothing. I talked to him about 25 years ago (as he moved to Califonia) and he still didn't think it was anything strange. I was really excited and couldn't take my eyes off it. We lost sight of it when it moved away and went behind some trees that were on our left. I emailed Skeptic Magazine about 2 years ago and they told me it was a flair. But flairs ignite and the piece the fell from the object burst into flames and extinguished in a matter of seconds. Still remember this like it happened yesterday."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33453.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33453.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.307433,+-76.3962(33453)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33453) map </A>","Latitude":"43.307433","Log Number":"US-11182011-0020","Summary":"orange cigar shaped object","Date Submitted":"11/18/2011 05:03 UTC","City":"Fulton","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Fulton","There were 2 other sightings in Fulton on or around October 28th 1969"],"Date of the Event":"10/28/1969 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:10:09","Longitude":"-76.3962","Country":"United States","Case Number":"33453","Object Shape":"Cigar","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
