{"City":"Franklinton","divs":["Sighting DetailsWalking dog just prior to sunrise, noticed bright light due east outside of normal flight paths. Initial observation suggested star or planet (was in same location of planetary conjunction event the night before), however while observing track of object determined it was tracking directly toward my position at probably the speed of a helicopter. Once it reached apogee over me, could make out a square arrangement of lights two in front and two in back with an obvious reflection of the sun on the main body. At apogee the craft turned smoothly due north and sighting was lost, it simply faded out. Am a retired Navy man with extensive observation skills and to this date have never observed something such as this."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"00:04:26","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36782.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36782.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/26/2012 06:02 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/26/2012 08:37 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.763148,+-90.246546(36782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36782) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03262012-0037","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Longitude":"-90.246546","Latitude":"30.763148","Region":"Louisiana","Summary":"Unknown Aircraft flying outside of traditional corridors","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Franklinton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"36782"}
