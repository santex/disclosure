Steve (who played the boy killed in the original \"Cowboys\" with John Wayne) was driving, and I was a passenger North-bound on the freeway when \"about watertank level\" we saw this bright triangular object. Steve kept saying it was a watertank. It made no sound and did not move at all. It was a \"perfect triangle\" with bright white tips. It had a zipper of red lights that rotated around it in a clock-wise direction. The time was right as it was getting dark, about 8:45 or 9pm. The object never moved, and Steve was scared! We lost sight of it as we drove past the Reseda exit. On the return trip (about 20 minutes later) it was gone."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47447.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47447.html"],"Case Number":"47447","Latitude":"41.796438"}
