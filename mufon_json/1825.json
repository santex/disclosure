The craft was a strange white tranlucent color with the dome not in proportionto the disc. The craft had a slight tilt (nose down) while moving in a straightline East to West.I knew immediatly that this was a UFO, my first words wereHOLY S--T I cant belive what I just saw. As I was driving and looking at thecraft a stand of trees started to block my view so I sped up to pass the treesand the craft was gone. Sorry I dont know my Lat or Long. at this time, howeverI will find it out."]}
