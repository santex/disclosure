And someone looked up and said, whats that thing? And we all just stopped talking and observed this red or orange large orb or disc shaped object. At first we thought it was a firework, but that was absolutely not the case since it traveled miles just without our range of view. The object came out of the northwest sky and traveled southeast. I couldnt determine a speed but it seemed like it could have been the same speed of a plane. It did not appear to alter speed at all. It seemed like it zigged and zagged a little bit as it traveled but it definitely traveled in one direction overall. It appeared to pulse like a red orange light. There was no sound. We tried to take some pictures but the pictures just look like a star against the black night sky. It was crazy. We were all speechless."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.966748","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:31 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40239.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40239.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 02:28 UTC","Summary":"Orange red pulsating sphere or orb in sky","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Hazleton","Longitude":"-75.964867","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.966748,+-75.964867(40239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40239) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Hazleton","There were no other sightings in Hazleton on or around July 4th 2012"]}
