I first saw the lights ahead of me on the right hand side of the road. From a distance I thought it was a rodeo arena lights - but I knew there wasn't an arena there. As I got closer I realized it was just lights - in a large circle and they were blinking. There was a car pulled over on the side of the road looking at it as well. I did not stop my car but as I drove directly by it, the lights were diminishing. After I passed by, I looked back in my rear view mirror and I could not see the lights. I thought it was amazing!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.225256,+-98.198173(15346)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15346) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/05/2009 07:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 3 other sightings in Stephenville on or around February 5th 2009"],"Summary":"Circle of lights.","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/05/2009 07:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15346.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15346.html"],"City":"Stephenville"}
