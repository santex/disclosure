It was cloudy and drizzling outside so the light stood out since there were no planes or stars visible. I thought it was a helicopter at first, but there were no blinking lights or sound. I stopped to observe it. It moved from east to west, then appeared to head towards me. It stopped in the sky. It was stationary for about one to two minutes. The light was an orange glowing somewhat spherical ball in the sky. After watching it for about two minutes, it appeared to ascend up into the clouds and disappeared. It was pretty eerie and gave me chills when it stopped and just hovered. After it disappeared, I just headed home and called it a night."],"Case Number":"27036","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"12/18/2010 11:58 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27036.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27036.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.411346","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.7762"}
