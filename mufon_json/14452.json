{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out in a nearby field to my home walking my dog when I saw three strange orange lights hovering in the sky. They then dissapeared without flying away but rather just into thin air. I thought mabye an airplane or helicopter but the object didnt move but rather stayed stationary? An exciting experience and I will be out every night until I see this object again."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-12182008-0003","Case Number":"14452","Longitude":"-79.991606","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14452.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14452.html"],"Latitude":"40.443765","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/18/2008 11:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around December 18th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Diamond, Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.443765,+-79.991606(14452)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14452) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Saw strange orange lights in the sky that hovered.","Date Submitted":"12/18/2008 11:45 UTC","City":"Pittsburgh"}
