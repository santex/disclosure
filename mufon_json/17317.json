(hope that helps). it was still daylight and i had no trouble at all seeing and distinguishing the object. it was definitely spherical as opposed to any other shape. i've never seen a ufo before, and therefore would love to know what it was...."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Parbold","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Summary":"Red, metallic, sphere, moving in a straight line from east to west silently.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.593769,+-2.770559(17317)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17317) map </A>","City":"Parbold"}
