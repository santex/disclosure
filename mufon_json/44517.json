We witnessed 2 military Jets going in opposite directions 1 going east to west and the other west to east using what my husband says afterburners, They appeared to be chasing a red object it appeared like a circle to my husband I say it looked more saucerlike, at one point it appeared to be descending south above the treeline then it ascended and veered to the west, when it did I noted a greenish bluish streak of light on the top left hand side of object it then with jets in pursuit moved in a northly direction until it was out of view and we no longer heard the jets. So the direction was south when initialy spotted veered west then appeared to move back south and acted like it was descending, When it abrutbly ascended and veered back westernly then moved north."]}
