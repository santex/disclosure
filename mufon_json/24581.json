{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I were stargazing in my back yard when we noticed something moving fast, far out there. It was so far out it was dim, and a bit hard to see. We watched it disappear behind clouds, and reappear on the other side. Eventually, it got too far away and disappeared as fast as it had come. It wasn't too spectacular to look at. The object was too far away to see it's actual shape. It just appeared as a dot, about the size of a star. We weren't sure what it was. There had been a couple of shooting stars out there. We figured it wasn't one of them because the object seemed to be changing direction, and adjusting itself as it flew. Immediately after it disappeared my first thought was to report it to MUFON."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"44.731909","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24581.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24581.html"],"Longitude":"-93.21772","Log Number":"US-07172010-0006","Region":"Minnesota","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Apple Valley","There were no other sightings in Apple Valley on or around July 17th 2010"],"Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 03:39 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/17/2010 02:19 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"24581","City":"Apple Valley","Summary":"Was stargazing and saw a light jut fast across the sky.
