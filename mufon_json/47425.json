I only remember three beings by my side in a room. A smaller being was on top of me. They communicated that they wanted me to hug it. So I did. Then it held me too tight. i tried to get it off me. I felt very strong and threw him off of me, He came back again. At that time, I was scared. That is all I remember. When I woke up and tried to remember what happened, I felt that they wanted me to nurture that being. I have been abducted many times before over my lifetime. I have been in contact telepathically with aliens as well. I have also seen ufos and aliens in the past."],"Longitude":"-124.516904","Region":"British Columbia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.82798,+-124.516904(47425)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47425) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/15/2013 01:46 UTC","Case Number":"47425","Date of the Event":"05/03/2013 03:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"being taken to a room that was made of steel or some type of metal","Latitude":"49.82798","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Powell River","There were no other sightings in Powell River on or around May 3rd 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47425.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47425.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"Powell River","Log Number":"CA-05152013-0008","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
