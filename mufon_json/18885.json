jupiter and the objects appeared ssw from my location number of observed objects(lights): 2 total duration of sighting: 2.5 minutes weather\\observational conditions: clear, no wind, moonless or moon behind trees, milky way banding visible and double stars in ursa major visible to unaided eye, no significant background lighting color: both objects remained white throughout event shape: disc\\circle brightness\\intensity: objects brighter than jupiter, non blinking or pulsating, one object changed intensity slightly later on in the event sound: none size: both about 1.5 times jupiter's apparent diameter objects' apparent motion (together) both objects were initially in motion for about 1.5 minutes. their motion appeared as if 2 light bulbs were attached to the \"multi axis trainer\" used in astronaut training with one bulb on the framework of one axis and another bulb on the framework of the other axis. it appeared that they were revolving around an uncommon center in a loose elliptical path. both objects were moving in a clockwise direction but changed to a counterclockwise direction for a moment then returned to clockwise. there was no other interaction between the objects such as light sharing or arcing. objects apparent motion (separately) after the initial 1.5 minute observation of motion, one object (disc #1) stopped its motion as if hovering and then the other object (disc #2) acceleratied in a ssw direction at an extremely high rate of speed until it was hidden by the trees marking the perimeter of the property. about 1 minute after object #2 was no longer visible, object #1 then accelerated from its hovering position in a sse direction at a similar rate of speed as object #2's object #2 displayed a slight increase in intensity as it was acceleration. after object #1 stopped, the remaining motions during the event were in apparent straight non curving lines. residual effects (physical): there were no vapor trails, however this would be difficult to observe since the moon had already set or was behind the trees and there were no significant background lighting residual effects (personal): disc #1 stopped as i stood up from my chair, this made me feel somewhat like i was the one being observed. local effects: just prior to my initial observation, i heard about 5 dogs barking, my two up the driveway and 2 or 3 within a quarter mile. i couldn't determine if the other dogs were barking because mine were barking or if they were barking due to another stimulus that they had perceived. time this report taken: almost immediately after the event was over - 9:18 who took the report: the report was taken and written by my father, arthur constantino 6 possum glen road wwantage (sussex), new jersey (same property - different house). my father is a retired science teacher of 38 years. he is 62 years old and had retired in july 2007. for a short period of time, he was a field investigator for apro. father's comments: melissa and i have talked about ufo's on occassion with her having no real opinion as to whether they are intelligently controlled devices or not. she does not read ufo books and has shown marginal interest in ufo documentaries on tv. when she called from the deck to tell me what she saw, i came out and observed that she was shaken but was able to provide needed information to the specific questions that i proceeded to asked her. we went over the event several times and also communicated with her air force friend on the other end of the telephone. he was on the phone when the event was taking place. i have read many books on ufo's and have taught my students that suspended judgement is an important part of science until the facts present themselves enough to draw specific conclusions. note: the closest airports are newark liberty international (nj), stewart international (ny). follow-up: i called the following police agencies to ask whether they had received any reports of ufo's within the above time frame. vernon, nj police - the direction where the lights?objects appeared new jersey state police, augusta, n.j. - patrols wantage township and surrounding areas. both agencies said that as of 9:40 that evening, there were no reports of ufo's. i did not persue atc."],"City":"Wantage","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18885.html"],"Summary":"2 objects moving around an uncommon center, one objects becomes stationary-other object accelerates away, then after 60 seconds, other objects departs in opposite direction","Date Submitted":"08/25/2009 09:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New Jersey","Date of the Event":"08/25/2009 09:14 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-74.624741"}
