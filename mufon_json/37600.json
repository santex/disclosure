{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from work, the usual route down the NJ turnpike to 78. This route takes me right passed Newark Airport. Each day I drive under scads of planes coming in and out of Newark, so I rarely pay attention. Route 78 runs East-West and as I was merging onto 78 West I notice a large gray object West of Newark airport. At first, I didn't pay much attention because of the constant plane traffic. However, I quickly realized that this was strange because plane traffic at Newark typically flows North-South, so I looked at the object more closely. It was about 1-2 miles (estimate) from the airport to West. I was actually talking to a friend of mine on the phone so I looked at my cell phone log when I entered the date & time above. I noticed it for about 2 minutes, it really didn't seem to move, I didn't see any lights. Then my view became blocked by an underpass and then by some trees, after all of the objects in my view cleared I no longer saw this object in the sky. The next day I did a google search for UFO & Newark but didn't see any recent sightings."],"trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Newark","There were no other sightings in Newark on or around April 18th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"04/18/2012 05:32 UTC","Longitude":"-74.163477","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37600.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.736737,+-74.163477(37600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37600) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/19/2012 08:54 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Region":"New Jersey","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Gray Object Near Newark, NJ","Log Number":"US-04192012-0012","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.736737","City":"Newark","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"37600","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00"}
