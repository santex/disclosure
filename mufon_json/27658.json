We were living on the third floor of an apartment building. Me and my brother shared a room that had a big window with a window seat in front of it. We usually slept with the curtins open. This happened late at night, the whole room lit up and the light awakened me. As I woke I looked out the window and at the time and fore manny years what I saw I thought I had seen a skeleton out side the window just hovering but now I know what I saw was an alien. At the time I saw a skelital head with big eyes, but after the years and knowing what I know and have seen it had to be alien. I was 7 at the time (I am now 61) and was so scared I woke my brother and we ran to my parrents room. When dad went to check our room it was gone. Being on the 3rd floor of the building has always bothered me."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Cambridge","There were no other sightings in Cambridge on or around October 21st 1956"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.37741","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.37741,+-71.100003(27658)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27658) map </A>","Log Number":"GB-02042011-0019"}
