I took the earplugs out and turned off the noise machine and realized it was not a noise that anything on Earth could make. I thought I detected a faint green light coming in through the blinds. I tried to get up but couldn't move, and I felt an unmistakable presense in the house. I felt as if I was being \"scanned\" for information. After about ten minutes, the noise began to fade and I was able to move again. I jumped out of bed to check on my daughter. She was fine and both she and my husband were asleep and did not hear the noise or wake during the event. Nothing else seemed disturbed so I shook my head and went back to bed. I never saw any beings or ships during this event but I felt their unmistakable presence. I had the feeling it had something to do with a book I recently wrote about global warming that will be published this coming summer (the book is directed at middle school students)."],"Tags":"City","City":"Mound","Date of the Event":"01/29/2007 03:30 UTC","Summary":"Strange high-pitched whirring noise at my house","Region":"Minnesota","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"6485","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.93663,+-93.666072(6485)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6485) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03032007-0002","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Longitude":"-93.666072","Latitude":"44.93663","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"01/29/2007 03:30 UTC"}
