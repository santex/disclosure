Thought it might be the cops at first but it was flashing very fast and was white. Ran out from my room and up the stairs to look out the window from the second floor and just saw the flashing lights illuminating the whole area. Seemed to be coming from above as the roof of neighboring homes were lighting up with each flash. Went on for about 15 to 25 seconds."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31156.html"]}
