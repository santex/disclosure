It flew West over Dresden and passed a military jet which was about 2 miles South of the object and several thousand feet higher. The disc was moving about twice as fast as the military jet and continued West towards the horizon. It would have been impossible for anyone looking at the sky in that direction to have missed it as the object was VERY bright, very fast, made no sound and left no contrail."],"Log Number":"US-06202012-0026","Latitude":"41.52439","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Case Number":"39654","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Shorewood","There were 3 other sightings in Shorewood on or around June 19th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.52439,+-88.193359(39654)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39654) map </A>","City":"Shorewood","Source":"MUFON"}
