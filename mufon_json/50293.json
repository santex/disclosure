WE sit outside all the time . Starting on August 17th myself and multiple witnesses have seen, photographed and videotaped two bright objects ( larger than stars ) > the larger of the two appears , hovers for 10-15 minutes at a time . It then pulsates, becomes brighter , dimmer...... A smaller object is sometimes seen. It flies directly into the larger object, then flies away. It circles the object and changes directions many times . The larger object will then move to the North , disappears, reappears several times. Sometimes it also appears that the large r object emits a light toward the ground . The object is in the western sky to the south of the Great Salt Lake. I see planes fly above and below it. It is BELOW the cloud cover I have posted this on FB and several people have seen the same thing. One person for two years.It She also spotted a large black aircraft fly over her house . I have contacted the media-nothing. FAA-nothing I have spoken with an astronomer . He said it is not a star, or satellite or conventional aircraft.
