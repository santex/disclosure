The group consists of 5 lites together , one in front then a pair side by side , then another pair. It is stationary , and always in the same place. It changes location with the rotation of the earth. Their appears to be a red lite in front. The shape is like a small row boat. I have looked at it thru binoculars but it is to dark to see the shape. It appears at dusk before the stars can be seen. I have seen a second object also a short distance away. My neighbors have also watched it. We were seating outside when we first saw the object. I am mainly interested in fining out what it is"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10764.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10764.html"],"Longitude":"-82.181195","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
