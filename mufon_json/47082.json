And as i was getting in my car i looked up at the sky, it was blue and some clouds, and i noticed for a few seconds a bright silvery metal oval or roundish object stationary next to a cloud. I sat in my car and looked again, realizing i had seen a ufo. I had only taken my eyes off it for a few seconds and it was gone. It must have went into the clouds. I kept looking to see if i could see it again, but i didn't. It was almost as if it was watching me, then hid. Thats the feeling i got, like there was defintely a connection, just a gut instinct i guess. I felt it was there for me to see it and then it hid. But this object seemed to have something that went around it in the middle, like maybe windows or huge rivets. It was definetly a ufo, no doubt."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47082.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47082.html"],"Latitude":"38.002017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.002017,+-84.516932(47082)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47082) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"47082","Date of the Event":"04/21/2013 01:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-04302013-0003","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Lexington","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.516932","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around April 21st 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Dome","Date Submitted":"04/30/2013 08:56 UTC","Region":"Kentucky"}
