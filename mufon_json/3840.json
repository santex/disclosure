As I sat watching TV I noticed this object out of the corner of my eye. I got up and walked to the window and watched a few seconds, turned away and walked across the room to get a pair of binoculers but when I looked at the object, I could not make out any more details. Never saw anything like it but first described it as a bullet shape and someone just told me: cylinder. I hesitated in reporting it but I'm wondering if anyone else saw it....like west of the mountains."],"City":"Westminster","Longitude":"-105.030086","Case Number":"3840","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Large cylinder shaped white, firey object from south to west traveling fast and disappearing behind high dark rain clouds","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
