Something told me to look up at the sky, I saw a bright white light flying at high altitude and high speed. At first I tought it was a plane but then then it dimmed to a barely visible blue light. It never changed speed, altitude, or direction during this time. I then noticed a second dim blue light heading in the opposite direction. Both lights were flying at the same speed and altitude. Both lights flew in a straight line. Neither light had any blinking lights on them and there was no sound. The weather was clear. I wasn't scared or anything I was more curious then anything. I lost sight of them when they flew out of my sight range."]}
