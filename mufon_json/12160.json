I was on Hwy 80. When i started to exit redtop road i noticed a large craft in the air. I was thinking to my self that looks strange. Was it a plane flying towards me? Then i realized it was hovering in one place. I don't know a military plane that hovers except a helicopter. i was thinking to my self i should take a picture. Then i thought about it its probably just a helicopter with two huge spot lights. I've never seen a helicopter that big with two spot lights. I couldn't tell if those spot lights were accually hitting the ground and it made no noise and didn't look like a helicopter. It was Above the open field next too the high school. while i was trying too get my celphone from the cracks in between my console and drivers seat. i had too stop at the stop sign and turn right. The ufo was huge it started too move above and the two spot lights flipped up and turned off but in an uncanny way i can't describe. then by the time i got my camera in my hand it took off so fast i saw a motion trail from the rear light and it was gone. It took me a while to report this because my friends and family don't believe me. Until i met someone that lives about 5 blocks down near gold hill road off of 680. This woman and her daughter we're standing outside their house that night but she said it was late at night. waiting for her husband . They Said they saw a large ufo with two huge lights and one rear light take off faster then they could imagine a modern aircraft is capable of doing. After she spoke of this i mentioned i saw the UFO too. I told her i would report it since i wasn't the only witness to this event."],"Latitude":"38.227493"}
