So I pulled into a gas station at about 10:45 The gas station is on the southeast corner of the intersection and I parked as close to the corner so she could spot me coming from the west. I was looking out for her (west) when I decided to take a glance high into the heavens, that's when I saw a very shiny object slowly moving from the north to the south. It was very bright, like a flashlight. At first I thought it was a kite because their was something else near it, like a small blurry grey triangle shaped object. Then I thought it was a ballon with something attached. Ufo fanatic and wanting to see something I never lost sight of it. That's when I was convinced it was neither!!! The object moved verry slow like I said from the north to the south then it stopped, it held its position for about two minutes then it moved east. The object moved verry slow like it was verry high I mean verry verry high! Then it stopped againg returning to it position and stood there for a couple more minutes. I tried not to blink and didn't. It never lost its brightness. That's when I said to myself \"UFO\". Then the object began to move south then headed southeast. And then it began to get smaller and smaller at the sametime moving southeast. It got to a point were it was like the size of a pin head and still shining. Then it just vanished. I was speechless, first tought that came to my head was MUFON so I got on my wireless internet and searched your number called and left a message, now I'm home typing away!!! Please notify me with any updates or other sightings that occured similar to mine. Thank you!"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"bright white and elevated slowly from low to very high","Date of the Event":"04/10/2008 10:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.041795","Region":"Nevada","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Henderson","There were 3 other sightings in Henderson on or around April 10th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-114.974541","Country":"United States","Case Number":"10242"}
