Since I am working on a degree in astrophysics, I was busy pointingout various constellations, Messier objects, planets and the random satellites.All of us were interested in how bright and obvious Venus was in the Westernsky. Just around this time is when we saw a bright flash near Venus. All of usstoppped and looked at each other knowing instantly that none of us knew what wehad seen, I think it is wise to mention that my other friends are both engineersand neither of them knew what we saw either. We did not hear any sound after,during or before the flash either, it looked like it had come from the left ofthe bright planet. Also there were no airplanes in the sky nor were there cloudsto have produced lightning. The area around the cabin is very secluded, andsince fire works are prohibited in the mountains in Colorado it would seemhighly unlikely that this could explain what we saw, plus the nearest town is tothe North-East."],"City":"Crawford","Log Number":"","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Crawford","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"38.703877","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Bright flash in South-West Colorado"}
