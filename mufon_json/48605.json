{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and me were outside on the deck watching the thunderstorm approach from the southwest when out of no where a reddish orange fog or cloud appeared. it started out dull in brightness but soon got brighter and brighter and was in my opinion roughly 10 to 15 miles away. as it was becoming brighter it was making its way towards our direction from the southwest and the closes it came was roughly 1\\4 of a mile from us. this event lasted roughly 10 minutes and it gave my wife and i a strong feeling of eeriness as it was making progress towards us and becoming bigger and bigger. the weird thing is we never saw a distinct detailed craft, we only saw a glowing fog or cloud that seemed to have intelligent control. this dense fog or cloud just dissipated after getting that close to us and it took roughly 2-3 seconds for it to dissappear. if anything has any idea what this was please add on your opinion. also there was no noise only a creepy feeling."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07042013-0017","Summary":"Reddish orange glowing fog or cloud was observed beside a thunderstorm from our deck.","Case Number":"48605","Latitude":"36.21628","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48605.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Longitude":"-76.249333","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Elizabeth City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.21628,+-76.249333(48605)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48605) map </A>","Region":"North Carolina","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/29/2013 09:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Elizabeth City","There were no other sightings in Elizabeth City on or around June 29th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2013 01:31 UTC"}
