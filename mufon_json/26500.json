The area is open with no trees. Heading south I saw a very bright object to the west-south-west, about 20 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be moving north, and was getting lower on the horizon as it moved. It moved from the approximate wsw position in the sky to a westerly position in about 20 seconds. The object was the shape of a skewed rectangle, about a third as high as it was long. It took up approximately an inch of sky at arms length. It was very bright, like a mirror shining in the sun, and did not put off a trail or sparks as with a meteor. I traveled at most 100 yards to the end of the road, and lost sight of it due to trees at the end of this road. I headed west toward home and attempted to catch sight of it again, but did not."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"26500","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","City":"Hugo","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-95.509682","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hugo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"11/10/2010 11:27 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/09/2010 09:19 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.01066,+-95.509682(26500)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26500) map </A>"}
