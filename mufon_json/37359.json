I saw nothing visually but when I placed the camera card into my computer I noticed that a object appeared at 5:32 according to the camera, then nothing in the series till 5:35 the object appears to have reappeared and moved in a northern direction. The fact it wasn't in the series for three minutes means it wasn't just some a passing blimp slightly out of focus. I am a private pilot, so I know a little about flying vehicles. A blimp which do visit SB very often would have moved in three minutes way out of the picture."],"Region":"California"}
