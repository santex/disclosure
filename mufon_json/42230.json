Our party saw a bright light that was streaking from the east towards where we were watching, it suddenly stopped and hovered, it then changed directions and went straight into the sky. We all saw it - family members and friends - and talked about it immediately and for days later. My husband called the Sheriff's office but they did not have reports of the sighting. I might add that my husband and I are former newspaper reporters and experienced observers. We both saw exactly the same thing, as did the others around us. It was not a plane or a star, we have never seen a sight like it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42230.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42230.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/03/2012 10:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-82.464321","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.384283,+-82.464321(42230)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42230) map </A>","City":"Huron","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"42230","Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"41.384283","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09022012-0023","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Huron","There were no other sightings in Huron on or around July 3rd 2012"]}
