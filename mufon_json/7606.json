Watched them as they stayed very still, and silent. Then they started to slowly move together and change postitions whilst still maintaining a triangle formation they then started to move , we followed them in the car, they zig zaggged across the sky and hovered again. We watched them and the bottom one flickered out and then the top two flickered out and were invisible. I was exhilerated to be seeing them I knew instinctively they were UFOs I have never seen aircraft like it before and there was no sound. The whole thing lasted 4 or 5 minutes."],"Date of the Event":"08/04/2007 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hemel Hempstead","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7606.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7606.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/04/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"jarman park , tescos store 3 orange balls of light in triangle formation","Latitude":"51.753241","Country":"United Kingdom","Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-08062007-0008","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"England"}
