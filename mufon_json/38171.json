{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking my dog on Sunday, May 13th, 2012 at approx 9:35 pm. When I walked 1 block from my house, I noticed something strange in the sky. The object was approx. 75-100 feet away in distance, elevated approx 5 stories (slightly above a house). This circular object was approx. as wide as a normal row home, hovering around 10-15 feet above the rooftops. It had a green glow around it, with blinking red and blue lights around it. I was able to snap one picture, though it was poor quality, before the object dissappeared."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38171.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38171_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38171.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Philadelphia","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Oval","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/13/2012 09:35 UTC","Case Number":"38171","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around May 13th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-75.125631","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.976317,+-75.125631(38171)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38171) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/15/2012 08:58 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05152012-0020","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.976317","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Summary":"While I was walking my dog, I noticed someting strange in the sky."}
