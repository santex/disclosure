At first we all thought it was an airpane in the distance. We went outside the screen to get a better look. Once they reached a certain altitude they turned south east and disappeared. They where slow moving but faster than an airplane is in the sky. The lights did not blink like running lights on a normal aircraft. They had very smooth and precise movement. We counted fourteen lights total all moving the same way, same speed, close together with no sound. Approxamently five minutes after the sighting we heard the sound of a jet aircraft. We looked up and saw it traveling toward the same direction the unidentified crafts had disappeared five minutes earlier. The jet was traveling at a very fast rate of speed. The entire sighting with jet took about twenty minutes."],"trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"05/27/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/28/2012 12:01 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05282012-0012"}
