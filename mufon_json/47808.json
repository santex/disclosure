At one point a friend and I both looked up and saw a bright white light moving overhead towards New Jersey. It slowed down a bit halfway over the horizon and abruptly shifted towards the right. It shifted again toward New Jersey and sped off at incredible speed over the horizon. I have never seen anything move that fast. It was obviously very high in the sky, emitting its own light. It could not have been a conventional aircraft, as it shifted and moved west faster than should be possible."],"Log Number":"US-06022013-0014","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Summary":"Light seen overhead, moving very fast","Case Number":"47808","Longitude":"-73.949162","City":"New York","Country":"United States"}
