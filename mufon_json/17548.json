{"City":"Shrewsbury","divs":["Sighting Detailsapprox 200ft up moving from east to west across an open field near the site of the battle of shrewsbury. large structured black triangle approx 200ft 250ft long and about 25ft wide. strange reddy orange lights on the corners and a very bright white light searching the fields from the front. triangle made no obvious sound but i could vagley make out a very low humming sound that was irritating. it passed almost directly over myself and my dog and as it did i felt a strange heat move through me. my dog was fine it just stood still and didnt make a sound but looked at the craft. i watched it move very slowly across the field before it suddenly shot off very quickly to the west at an unbelievable speed i would estimate to be approx 3000 miles per hour. i called raf shawbury to report the craft to air traffic control but they said nothing was picked up."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.706935,+-2.752722(17548)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17548) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"06/18/2009 11:15 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Shrewsbury","There were no other sightings in Shrewsbury on or around June 18th 2009"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"17548","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"52.706935","Longitude":"-2.752722","Date of the Event":"06/18/2009 11:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17548.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17548.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"GB-06192009-0008","Summary":"Low flying black triangle omitting no sound but a strange heat source.","Region":"England","Tags":"City","Country":"United Kingdom","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00"}
