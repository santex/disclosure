The second time there were two they would dance in different directions and occasionally come close together ans thes shoot off in different directions. Tonight I decided to check to see if they were back and I saw two this time one seemed to follow me when I moved in the yard to get a chair then it came right over me and stayed there for some time. The other one seemed to stay a good distance away but did move around a good while. I need to know if this is real or if I am completely loosing it. I need help to decide. Thanks.
