I thought at the time that it kind of fluttered.I initially thought it was stationary untill it turned to it's left, my right, heading north. That is when I searched for the plane that I thought should have been towing this. I did not see anything else. This object was a rectangle,a light solid color, a light grey. What was strange was that it was a rectangle when it was traveling toward me. This all happened in Denver, Colorado on 10-30-2011. I was parked across the street from a golf course. I took a few photo's with my phone.I was going to try to follow it, but realized it was a good distance away, and I did not think I could drive safe, in lunch time traffic and keep an eye on it. I did pull forward and take a few more pictures. It seemed to speed up slightly, the farther away it got. That is when I lost sight of it. This took maybe 5 minutes or less. I then looked at the pictures I took, not really seeing anything, I began to zoom in on the picture, and kept the new pictures. I was able to at least get the shape of the object. I did watch the news and newspapers the next few days,although I did not see any reports of anything unusual. I have found a few reports of rectangles in the Denver area, but not on my date. I will send the best pictures, but they are from a phone camera taken at a distance."],"City":"Denver","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"39.737567","Summary":"object appeared to be traveling toward me, then turned and traveled parallel","Log Number":"US-04162012-0013","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date Submitted":"04/16/2012 09:12 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Longitude":"-104.984718"}
