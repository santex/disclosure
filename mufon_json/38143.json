The clouds quickly dispersed, but the lights remained, disappearing and re-appearing randomly. The light to my left eventually turned into a small prick of light, and then appeared as a dim star before disappearing, the light to my left kept the same shape and just faded out quickly. We live in the flightpath of Heathrow airport and as such, are accustomed to seeing aeroplanes regularly - these were certainly not aeroplanes! At least 3 aeroplanes were visible during the sighting. The objects made no absolutely noise whatsoever."],"Date Submitted":"05/14/2012 06:23 UTC"}
