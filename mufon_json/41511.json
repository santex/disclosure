I had just exited one of the roof boiler rooms when I noticed a very bright light to the east moving slowly in a north west direction. The direction of travel was odd because I am by the airport and the aircraft landing aproach is from east to west. The direction of this object would have made it cross the flight path of an aircraft landing at the airport. I was able to record approximately 10 seconds of video with my phone before the light abruptly vanished. I attempted to relocate the light for several minutes, but was unable to find it. I did observe a helicopter circle the area I had last seen the light, but only once. I can not be sure that the helicopter was investigating the area where the light was, or if it was simply making a wide turn to come back around. I did however find it somewhat suspicious due to the timing and location. The video quality is not very good."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/07/2012 08:43 UTC","Longitude":"-117.150225","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
