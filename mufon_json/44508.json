As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw a strange machine floating in the corner of my room. It was about the size and shape as a lunch box with a tube coming out of the top left corner about as thick as a golf ball and about 8 inches long. At the end of tube was a circle. I was thinking at the time that it looked like a webcam. It hovered there motionless for a few seconds and I felt like I was being closely watched. Then it moved to the left and passed through the wall like the wall was not even there. The entire time, I did not feel scared but rather curious. Afterwards, I was unable to go back to sleep. I was wide awake. It was NOT a dream. There was really something there. All I could do was lie there and watch it. I couldn't move until it was gone. I never heard of anything like this before. I tried looking it up online and could find anything like this."],"Object Features":"Other","Date of the Event":"12/12/2012 05:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"44508","Region":"Idaho","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
