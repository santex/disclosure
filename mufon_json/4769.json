We were talking about life in general and all what people talk about in the evenings. I looked up into the dark sky, and I told my father to also look up, and we both saw these 3 lights forming a triangle. These 3 lights rotated around and around for at least 30 minutes to an hour. We tried to understand what it could have been! And it did look just like the underneath of a some sort of UFO space craft. 3 lights glowing, and rotating around and around. We though maybe some club or disco down town, reflect lights into the sky! We are still not sure if there are any clubs down town that do that sort of thing. I think if we go around to the main clubs etc, and ask them if they have ever used some sort of reflecting facility that causes a reflection into the sky."],"City":"London","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.513669,+-0.120025(4769)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4769) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"England","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"3 lights forming a triangle","Case Number":"4769","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-0.120025","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"GB-05112006-0002"}
