I just started screaming for my son who is 27 years old, Daniel ufo hurry, I was running to his camper, he and his 19 year old stepson came outside. We were all in shock as we watched this!We watched as 2 more planes crossed going right by this other plane and ufo. I didn't notice any responce by any of the planes, when they all had to see this circular object!! My 11 year old grandson will never be the same! All 4 of us have changed our way of thinking!The thing was traveling south to north!! This was very wierd but I felt like it new we saw it! I went on youtube to see if anyone else saw it.
