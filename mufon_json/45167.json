I always look at the stars at night when I let him out. I noticed this brighter light in the sky, at first i thought a plane since I live next to the airport, but then I noticed this thing wasn't moving. I observed it then ran and got my wife. She saw the three colors it was letting off, blue, whit and red. It stayed very still for about 20 mins, it moved so slow that the only way I knew it was moving was because it looked closer to the building then it did before. I have two videos of it. I'm not gonna sleep tonight!!! and sorry for the swearing on the video"],"Log Number":"DE-01122013-0007","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45167.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45167.html"],"Summary":"Orb with twinkle effect, blue white, every so often red","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Hessen","Longitude":"8.682127"}
