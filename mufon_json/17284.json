{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Very bright Object in Sky, Was not a star or planet; [cms/tg/pid]","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting DetailsGoing to work at 5:10am I saw a bright light in the sky. I don't normally see any star or planet at this location. I took out the binoculars and could see this was not a star but a roundish object. I quickly took out my Nikon S630 digital camera and took several photos. The object was either stationary or slow moving as I could not detect any movement. This object was brighter than any other star or planet in the sky. I was surprised to see it appear as a red color on the top of the object in the photograph."],"Date Submitted":"05/29/2009 05:10 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Westminster","There was one other sighting in Westminster on or around May 29th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-105.034945","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"17284","Date of the Event":"05/29/2009 05:10 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17284.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17284.html"],"Latitude":"39.842953","City":"Westminster","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06012009-0004","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.842953,+-105.034945(17284)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17284) map </A>"}
