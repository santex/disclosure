At first there were 3 and then a final floating orange orb appeared after the others had faded away. I even pulled out my iPhone and filmed this event. Unfortuatnely, the iPhone did not record anything despite that it was definitely flashing the red \"recording\" button. Next, I called a friend in the area and he confirmed the sighting. These were very bright orange orbs moved very casually southward about a mile above. After floating for about 3 minutes the first 3 disappeared and another appeared. The final orb continued floating for about 2 minutes before it stopped glowing orange. I could distinguish a faint object where the glowing orange orb had been. This tiny dot of a thing floated for a little longer before becoming difficult to see."],"Summary":"HOVERING ORANGE ORBS","trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around February 11th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-02122012-0008","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.157218,+-86.781323(35643)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35643) map </A>","Latitude":"36.157218"}
