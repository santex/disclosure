Upon pulling into my driveway i noticed the light was moving in a south direction but very slow. Suddenly after watching the light for about 2 min, the light went out and I could see a dark object move over the area, no lights at all...there were some commercial planes flying extremely high... this object had to be below 500 feet. It was extremely odd that the lights went out in the object and it continued to fly especially seeing how there is a large airport in our area and the safety of the planes in the area, which is what made me feel like this was not something that we had in the air....Planes do not fly at night without lights on them."],"Date Submitted":"09/20/2013 07:14 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.135019,+-76.082496(50936)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50936) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Cicero"}
