I looked up and saw 4 lights, 2 of which were changing colors. I was scared and told my parents. They told me to report it to you guys so I came in here to do so. This all took place at 9:07 PM EST today, March 19, 2005. It was a little cloudy, but there were breaks in the clouds which allowed me to see this. After I saw this small detail, it flew quickly west."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3417.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3417.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Latitude":"40.491737"}
