My husband and I both saw the object illuminating the multi colored light just hovering in the same spot..it proceeded to dim to nothing then lost site of the light..I waited a few seconds to see if it would pop up anywhere else,then my husband saw it pop up again and I saw it with my own eyes again in the same spot it was previously in before,but it only stayed lit for about another 30-45secs then it disappeared for good...it actually was the coolest thing I ever seen."],"Summary":"saw flashing colored lights brighter than a star it flickered about 5mins then dimmed to nothing then gone from sight just dissapeared","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33985.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/11/2011 07:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Brimfield","There were no other sightings in Brimfield on or around December 11th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-12122011-0011","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.207771","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/12/2011 03:56 UTC","Region":"Massachusetts","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Brimfield"}
