(i've taken 20 hours of flight training, so i know a little about small planes, but i'm only a beginner.) i'd say it was as bright as the north star can be at times, perhaps a little brighter. the movements seemed too erratic and significant for either an airplane or helicopter. i scanned the sky and noted no other stars as bright, and in fact, based on the angle and city\\town lights, there were only one or two stars easily visible from what i recall. they were an order of magnitude dimmer. i watched for about 30 seconds when i considered grabbing my wife's iphone 3gs off her night table as she slept. but the object was far enough away that the iphone's camera (2 megapixel) would not have captured the movement, so i left the bedroom to find my digital slr downstairs in the kitchen. unfortunately, while i was in my bedroom, my daughter had woken up, walked to the top of the stairs leading down to the kitchen, laid down and fell back to sleep. i carried her back to her bed in the room next to ours and tucked her in. i retrieved my camera from downstairs and grabbed a more capable lens on the way. by the time i got back to the window, about 4-6 minutes later, the object was gone. in my mind, this ruled out the possibility of it being a star or other celestial body, but i'm no astronomer. i watched periodically for another 30 minutes, but did not see anything. i did some googling and searched twitter from any other recent sightings and noted a recent sighting in broad daylight in acton, ma. i also read about a correlation between disasters and ufo sightings. the aug. 23 quake in virgina was felt in massachusetts, so this came to mind. my wife had woken up and did a few things while i kept looking. i didn't want to frighten her, so i saved the story until daylight. in summary, it was very strange. i've never seen anything like it. i should have asked my wife for help so that i could keep my eyes on it."],"Summary":"Bright jittery starlike object observed from Andover,MA","Date Submitted":"08/25/2011 03:53 UTC","Case Number":"31157","Date of the Event":"08/25/2011 02:25 UTC","Region":"Massachusetts","Log Number":"US-08252011-0012","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.660903,+-71.143777(31157)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31157) map </A>","Longitude":"-71.143777","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Latitude":"42.660903","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Andover"}
