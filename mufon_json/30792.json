Others on 31 had to have seen it because everyone was hitting their brakes (10:30 pm.) Not having any idea what it was we followed it a short way through a subdivision. It ascended into the sky to the east for at least a mile and poof it disappeared just as it had appeared. When we got home 45 minutes later two large jets flew very low over our home heading east.(Grissom afb is nearby). A friend told me they flew over again about 3:30 a.m. and woke her up. The jets are very unusual any more since grissom is no longer a regular afb. Wish we'd taken photos with our cellphones but did not have time."],"Log Number":"US-08102011-0011","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-86.107721","Date Submitted":"08/10/2011 10:59 UTC"}
