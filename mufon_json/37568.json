Our deck is covered with a gazebo so she did not see anything but I do alot of star gazing being that I am into Astronomy. I was looking around the sky when right almost directly over head there was a very bright light. The light was about 3 times brighter than Venus and it took me a minute to realize that Venus was further west of my location so I watched this light for about 20 seconds then it slowly went faded to a very dim red color until it went completely out of sight. The object was not moving at all and it was so bright that you could see the rays of light filter through the light cloud cover that was present. There were aircraft in the area and this seemed to be at almost the same altitude as they were. This was not any satellite or aircraft and it was not the space station being as it was not moving at all. I do not think this was any kind of meteor either due to its stationary position. I would guess it was about 10 degrees Southeast of my zenith position and I was facing East."],"Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37568.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37568.html"]}
