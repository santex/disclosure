Then they just disappeared then we saw a row of more lights I would say it was about 15-20 crafts heading in the same direction, this lasted for about 20 minutes and we watched from our bedroom window at one point I saw a group of 5-6 craft form a odd shape triangle shape . These were not fireworks they were some sort of aircraft. I have 110 hours in the air,studied aviation and these where not planes or helicopters as the lights were not flashing(blinking wing lights-red or green). And you can see that its was a line of craft coming from the North. Which I thought was strange for that time of night and if they were military jets you can usually hear the noise."],"Longitude":"-72.999007","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:00 UTC"}
