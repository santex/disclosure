{"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy mother and I were expecting a bus at 18:30 o'clock on a small town, when suddenly my mom looked at the sunset sky and saw a strange bright silver object, moving slowly coming from the southeast, the object stopped right over a mountain looking for a place to land near some high voltage towers, I was stunned and speechless staring the silver object hovering in one place, it hold the position about 10 minutes then the object suddenly started to fall slowly, the \"landing\" lasted another 10 minutes until the object disappeared behind the mountain. This is the first time we saw something like this, we have many flights in our sky BUT this one doesn't seems to be a conventional aircraft. I asked many people about this kind of aerial phenomena but only two guys, friends, saw something very weird in the same direction months ago, \"we saw a weird intense dark green light illuminating a small portion of the night sky for few seconds\" they described it as well. PD: The mountains are 3.5 miles from our point of view."],"Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Latitude":"9.901107","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Turrialba","There were no other sightings in Turrialba on or around August 11th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Object Features":"Dome","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Cartago","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18626.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18626.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/11/2009 06:30 UTC","Longitude":"-83.684547","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=9.901107,+-83.684547(18626)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18626) map </A>","City":"Turrialba","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Bright Silver Object Hovering","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"18626","Date of the Event":"08/11/2009 06:30 UTC","Log Number":"CR-08122009-0014","Country":"Costa Rica"}
