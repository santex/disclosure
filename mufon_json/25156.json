When I opened up the front door in the sky to the left of me was a strange very out of place object. It was what appeared to be two very large fireball orange glowing almost burning from within spheres just gliding across the sky. The larger sphere was leading and a smaller one seems attached or tethered to the larger one at the center. They both seemed to have an aura field around them that glowed a lighter shade of pale orange. They emitted no sound at all. I watched as they floated into a cloud bank and had to leave to get to work on time. I would estimate the size to be around that of which if you held your arm out the larger would be between a and half dollar and the smaller one about the size of a dime."],"Latitude":"39.938282","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"25156","Region":"Illinois","Sighting Duration":"00:03:01","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Two orange fireballs seemingly tethered at the center gliding across sky.
