I pulled over and it was apparent it was definitely not a plane or chopper and not man made. then the 1 light turned to 3 possibly 4 distinct lights and was dropping small lights or orb like things that vanished or disintegrated shortly after leaving the craft. It was slow and steady no blinking or speed change. the lights all went out several times and came back on. I took pics with the iphone and at 1st they look like a ball of light but when zoomed clearly shows 3 separate lights. Should've tracked down the other people that saw it!"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Walnut Creek","There were no other sightings in Walnut Creek on or around October 6th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"10/06/2013 07:06 UTC"}
