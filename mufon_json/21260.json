For me it was larger than a light on a plane and brighter with white centre and red edge. Watching this light accelerate and slow down holding a straight course slowly across the sky. Then I noticed a second object farther south flying in a similar manner. After 40 seconds the first on became dimmer and disappeared the second did the same thing in a similar spot in the sky. No sooner had the second fizzed out a third one came out of the same area in the south sky and did a similar flight pattern again and disappeared as well after 30 seconds. I've seen comet's, meteor's, northern lights, sky lab, The ISS and satellites never seen anything like this."],"Date of the Event":"12/29/2009 07:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21260.html"],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"21260","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.178056,+-115.571944(21260)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21260) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Alberta","Summary":"3 separate very bright soundless lights fly south to north fizzling out after a couple of minutes","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Banff","Sighting Duration":"00:02:15","Longitude":"-115.571944","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
