(the only way i could tell was that the light briefly bumped into the cloud layer during its travel) as i mentioned, there was no noise. absolutely none. no \"pop\" no explosions... and it was a very cold night. on nights that cold you can typically hear a car horn from 10 miles away on account of the density of air molecules. if it was a firework we would have heard it. im sending this to you guys because i'm hoping someone else saw the same thing. maybe someone can explain this. it's really been bothering me ever since."],"Case Number":"11349","Tags":"City","City":"San Clemente"}
