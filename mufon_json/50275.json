The lights would then take off in different directions. We've been seeing these mostly in the northern sky between the big dipper and the cassiopea constellations between 9.30 pm and 10.00 pm central standard time. One night last week when we saw this, the dogs (about 30 neighborhood dogs) all around us were barking loudly and continuously until the lights left. Last night, when we were walking, we observed the lights again. The light flashed bright then went black - about four times. Then the light disappeared all together. We've also witnessed two lights doing this at the same time then chasing each other across the sky. We know they are not planes. But we can't tell how close or far the objects are. We don't have the equipment necessary to film this observance. Hopefully one of you can."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pleasanton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50275.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50275.html"]}
