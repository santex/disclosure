Jupiter......just below and to the right of the moon at a distance of about 5 moon diameters...for about 3 minutes while chatting on my phone out on my deck for useable reception ...I noticed them because they should not have been there...they were absolutely motionless at too high an angle...separation between the two was about one moon diameter... they were NOT plane landing lights...as I suspected at fist sight. I finished my call and went inside and grabbed my 10x 50's...took less than 30 seconds...when I came back out....they were gone... I was pissed at myself for not reacting sooner as the seconds and then minutes passed... realizing they were motionless...with more and more certainty...the angle was just too high... If they were some kind of illuminated balloon... I thought I would have noticed some type of motion... wavering...flickering,oscillation...something......no....they were constant and seemed to be very distant. parachute flairs of different shades...burning out together is my best guess I was seeing something unusual...did anyone else...?"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-74.997946","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
