25 feet above ground level and looked out the eastern facing window. i could then see it was above the trees and stationary. i waited about 30 seconds to see if it had movemant comming toward me or away - because it would not appear to be moving then. it wasn't and suddenly flared up about 3 times and got really bright then shunk down again to its former intensity and size. when it flared a yellowish part of the light appeared to extend downward. it was very cold and clear so i still told myself that perhaps i was seeing a helicopter just above the trees with a searchlight that was tilting around on the bottom of it an thus giving the affect. i got out my binoculars and looked at it and i could see the same thing only larger and clearer and then it pulsed again even brighter and the that lower yellow extension of light was really visable... and then another one came up along side it to my left and thus from the south. this was not as intense and only raised to be level with it on the same plane and then stayed still. the first pulsed again and then i new it was unidentifiable by me. i woke my wife and brought her to the window which all took about two minutes. she tried the binoculars but has to have glasses and couldn't get them in focus. shelooked at them with her naked eyes (with her glasses on) and she was moved to say whoa- which should somewhat support the intesity and oddness of it. i continued to watch through binoculars. i guess about 5-8 minutes had passed, but i havn't gone through this statement to add up the time i already stated. at this point a third came above the treeline from the south and all three started to move north\\northwest. this entire 5-8 minutes the first had stayed perfectly stationaty pulsating irregularly (strong, weak, weak, weak, strong, strong, strong, strong, weak, strong...you get it) the second had stayed still and perfectly spaced to the right(south) of the first. as soon as the third came into view it was spaced as far as the second was to the first, all three started to move...as i have stated. this was about a full minute to all happen. at this point my wife thought it was all over but had the same reaction of wow...and decided to return to bed. i said goodnight 30-45 seconds, then returned to the window with the binoculars. the first 3 were gone when a 4th came up faster than the others were moving and stopped where the first one had been. if pulsed once. it jumped or moved up, then down, then went very fast to the north\\northwest. this jumping up and down was not a great distance from where i was. if i were going to plot it on my window as if this had all happened in 2 dimensions it would be less than a half inch. but at the distance away they were - at least 5 miles it must have been great. it was a very fast up\\down and then move. that confirmed for me is was not identifiable. i called the flying cloud airport and the helicopter place and they stated they had no activity at that time. they are very small. i know distance is hard to gage but i think it was at least 5 miles away- just above the tree line, perhaps above lake riley. i looked on mapquest and moved the map over eastward trying to figure out where it was and that seams to be the most likely poistion. i will watch the skies tonight to see if they or conventional aircraft do anything like this to either dispell or confirm my thought. i would like to believe it was conventional but they just didn't portray conventional behavior. give me a call if you want more. i just hope others saw it too."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.55783","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.857207"}
