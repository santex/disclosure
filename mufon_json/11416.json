{"divs":["sighting detailsi was outside with my dog about 9:00 pm and i looked up at a pair of stars when i noticed that there was an object moving between the two stars. i followed it for a few seconds then it vanished. about a second or two after it vanished there was an orange\\white flash\\burst of light. i am pretty sure it was not an airplane because there were planes in the sky before, during and after the sighting. also, there were no blinking lights on the object like there are on airplanes. from where i was standing the object looked like it was about the distant of a star."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07042008-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11416.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11416.html"],"Summary":"saw an object going from south to north.
