We were headed east on the northern loop of 465. We both were talking about our vacation events when we both looked at each other and said, \"what the heck was that!\". The horizon of the sky was still barely lit up (it was almost 10 o'clock) We were headed east and we saw what appeared to be helicopter or a flare in the distance. It was noticable brigher than anything around it. I had just assumed it was a star or maybe a planet. Then all of a sudden from it's motionless position in the sky it darted downward or north east extremely fast. It almost looked like a shooting star, however I have NEVER seen a shooting star start in a stationary position in the sky for at least ten seconds and then quickly dart downward in the sky."],"Date of the Event":"08/09/2009 09:55 UTC"}
