I was sitting on my balcony and when I looked up I saw a giant egg in the sky. As I watched this egg it shimmered from white to silver. The next thing I saw was absolutely amazing. The egg began to crack open. From inside a giant chicken appeared. The giant chicken flew around using his wings. The chicken then flew to the ground. This chicken then spoke to me. I asked him the only question I could think of. I said \"please tell me great chicken, what came first, the chicken or the egg.\" The giant alien chicken responded, \" My daughter, free the imprisoned chickens from the earth.\" I then realized the master race of all humanity was the chicken. It is now my life duty to free all the chickens from the cannibalistic humans. The chicken then answered my question. He said all chickens and all life comes from bacteria and all the aliens exist in peoples brains."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There was one other sighting in Las Vegas on or around June 2nd 2009"],"Date of the Event":"06/02/2009 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23126.html"],"Region":"Nevada","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-115.163426","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
