Once it started moving we noticed a very bright beam of light came out of craft like a spotlight for the duration of about five sec. then back to low light and came to a stop far off. Then after about 2 min. the craft got brighter & looked as if it was going straight up into space until we couldnt see it anymore or the light could have just got bright and then demed out. about ten min. later we saw two star like objects steady light not blinking intersec, they looked like they were actually going to hit eachother. these were also at very high altitude. they crossed pathes at same time like they were going to hit and we watched them until they faded out of view. we always seem to see this activity close to or right after the eight oclock hour pm."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.45937,+-86.990581(28788)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28788) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Alabama","Date Submitted":"04/23/2011 12:38 UTC","Case Number":"28788","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28788.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hueytown","There were no other sightings in Hueytown on or around April 22nd 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/22/2011 08:25 UTC","Longitude":"-86.990581","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04232011-0014"}
