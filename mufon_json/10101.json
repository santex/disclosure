This has been occuring since September 2007. This is the best footage that I have captured to date of my sightings. It started with 2 or 3 lights in the sky, very bright and seem to be strobing blue red and white. Sometimes orangeish color. These lights blink on, out of nowhere and hover or stay stationary in the sky for minutes at a time. They make formations and then depart. Most of my activity is at sunset on the west horizon. As big as the star Sirius. Twice as bright and different colors."],"Longitude":"-92.74862","Date of the Event":"11/26/2007 05:20 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hudson","There were no other sightings in Hudson on or around November 26th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"None"}
