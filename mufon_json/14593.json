{"divs":["sighting detailsthere was no air conditioning in those days, and my family and i were sitting under a shade tree on the east side of our house. we first noticed the object in a fluttering descent from west to east, approximately 1\\4 of a mile northwest of the house. it went out of site behind our barn for a few seconds, then continued to descend until it was at at tree-top level with a wooded area located to the northeast of our location. the ufo made a 90degree left turn and flew into an opening between our woods and our neighbors', still descending. my father believed a small airplane had just crashed, and he and i ran the quarter mile to the woods in the heat of an august afternoon. we found nothing, no wreckage, no broken tree limbs, nothing! i have no memory of its shape. the color was dull grey, and i destinctly remember the fluttering motion which reminded me of a kite with a broken string. there were five of us, father, mother (both deceased) two younger sisters and myself."],"Date Submitted":"08/15/1947 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.429773","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-12292008-0006","Case Number":"14593","Longitude":"-84.87135","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","City":"Butler","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/15/1947 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14593.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14593.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"UFO appeared to crash in wooded area a quarter mile from observers.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.429773,+-84.87135(14593)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14593) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Butler","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown"}
