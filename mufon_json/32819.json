I went out side because there were jets flying low and it was strange because they seemed very low and I heard the dogs barking next door.

It blinked on and off and when it dissapered I thought the plane just turned its back side and I could no longer see the lights anymore.The second time I saw it after a minute I sat down again and the same lights were in the same spot again. then it dissapared .
