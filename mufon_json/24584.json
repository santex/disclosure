{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting on the porch having a cigarette and star gazing as I always do. There was a bright round light that was floating at an even altitude for quite some distance, then rapidly climbed upward and looked like it slowly burned out, the loss of light was like what you would see if it was a meteor but traveling up not down and at a much slower pace. I had a guest that I asked to step outside and take a look, neither of us could see anything that would identify this object as typical aircraft, such as blinking lights, and we both watched as it climbed and disappeared."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Dallas","Log Number":"US-07172010-0009","Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 05:20 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/08/2010 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-123.307757","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"44.925574","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.925574,+-123.307757(24584)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24584) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24584.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24584.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24584","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around July 8th 2010"],"Summary":"Bright light floating at even altitude then rapidly climbed and slowly faded out.","Country":"United States"}
