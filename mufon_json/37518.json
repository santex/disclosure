I noticed a dark object hovering near the tree line over the area of New Caney High School. It looked very dense and was about the size of a Suburban, but had an oval-like shape. It's surface was not smooth, but had many bumps and ridges. I asked my family if they could see what I was seeing. At least four of us saw it. It never moved and the whole sighting did not last very long as we were driving past it and traveling away from it. As my curiosity peaked, I insisted we turn the vehicle around at FM 1485 to get a better look, but one family member became very upset, so we did not go back."],"Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","Date Submitted":"04/16/2012 01:55 UTC","Longitude":"-95.203982","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/08/2011 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
