The image had to be enlarged several hundred times, but it is very evident that his is not an illusion. The being is clearly visible and you even see the trail in the sand behind him where he walked and he casts a shadow on the ground just in front of him. This is a valid image and you can clearly see the beings legs, torso, head and body. The image is available to anyone to examine and is very unexplainable. The image is the panoramic view from the Rocknest on Mars."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
