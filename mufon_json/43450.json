No sound at all. Travelled N to S. Very bright. Stayed at same elevation throughout flight. Hard to tell how high but not super high elevation because I thought they were geese. A spotlight from a corn maze was going at the same time but this was unrelated as i saw the spotlight moments after and was not nearly as bright and could not account for the brightness of the wedge or the direction."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.875361,+-122.170003(43450)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43450) map </A>","City":"Everett","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43450.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43450.html"],"Case Number":"43450","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"a wedge looked like 4-5 white geese just gliding no noise moving fast","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"47.875361","Object Features":"Wings","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Log Number":"US-10212012-0027"}
