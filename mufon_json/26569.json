LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT THEN I NOTICED AGAIN .AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE, HELICOPTER OR SOME TYPE OF SATELITE BUT THEN I REALIZED IT COULDNT BE THAT . THE FLASH DIDNT MOVE FROM HIS POSITION . I WENT INSIDE & GOT MY COAT & BINOCULARS. THE FLASH APPEARED EVERY 13 SECONDS WITH NO NAVEGATION LIGHTS,IT HAD 3 VERY SMALL VERTICAL PARALELL LIGHTS. IT LOOKED VERY HIGH IN THE SKY. APROX. 10 MINUTES LATER IT MOVED NORTH IN REFERENCE WITH THE SORROUNDING STARS.IT REMAINED THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES & THEN MOVED SOUTH AGAIN TO ANOTHER POSITION. AFTER A FEW MORE MINUTES IT STARTED TO MOVE EAST & LOSES ITS BRIGHTNESS UNTIL IT FADED VERY SLOWLY OUT OF THE SKY. THE PULSES ALWAYS REMAIN AT THE SAME TIME.THERE WAS NO SOUND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OBSERVATION. THIS LASTED ABOUT 20 MINUTES."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"11/14/2010 02:11 UTC","Log Number":"US-11142010-0011","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like, Unknown","Case Number":"26569","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
