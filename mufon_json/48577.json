Under path for LAX and thought this was a plane on right base turn to the airport. I stood to observe it and noticed that it didn't move. I kept watching and waiting for some action however, it stayed motionless. There were a few light clouds and it seemed to be shining through them. I didn't notice any anti-collision lights so I knew it couldn't have been a helicopter and the fact that it wasn't moving convinced me it wasn't the ISS flying over head (which is the brightness I would describe it). I went and got my binoculars and as I watched it for several seconds more, it slowly began to dim until if finally vanished. Moments later, some friends of mine several miles away called and asked if there was a supernova in the sky and described it the way I saw it also."],"Case Number":"48577","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright Light Hovering in the sky","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.96712","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48577.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48577.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"07/02/2013 09:45 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.96712,+-118.10247(48577)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48577) map </A>","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Pico Rivera","There were no other sightings in Pico Rivera on or around July 2nd 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Pico Rivera","Log Number":"US-07032013-0007"}
