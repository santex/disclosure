(crappy kodak easyshare c143 12 mp) i zoomed in a tried to steady myself and snapped a shot. i realized i needed a tripod. staring at the object i debated, then ran inside again to retrieve my tripod from the closet. fumbling, i got set up, and was thankful to still see the object. i took 3 more still shots, and 2 videos. this whole while (approx 4-5 minutes) i was trying to judge the distance. my best guess is that it was 2000-5000' in altitude and maybe 1\\2 mile to my north, about 50-60 degrees above the horizon. it was still there, so i ran inside for my binoculars. i was stunned to see that is was perfectly symmetrical, rounded at both ends, dimensionally 1 unit in diameter by maybe 5-6 units in length, with 2 dark spots at either end. those dark spots turned out to be lights. they pulsed on for a second or two, then dimmed dark. not on and off like a light switch. the light seemed of the palest white-yellow. i then went back to the camera to make another video, wishing i could zoom in more, but when i looked back up, the object was gone. i unhooked my camera and ran around the house to the front to try to relocate it, without success. then i came inside to upload my photos and video. after checking them i was disappointed, because there is only the faintest spot. i then looked at the images in ms paint, and was happy to see the cigar shape, after zooming in. i did not alter, crop, resize anything. the files attached are in original condition. the object will be found in the lower left corner of the photos and video just above the trees, and to the right of the tip of the highest oak leaves on the left side of the images. it's very small, but it is there--it looks like a pale translucent white orb until you zoom in. in the video, you can see the sun glint on the object at 31-33 seconds, and at 54-56 seconds.) honestly, i debated coming to this sight, but i did, and that is when i noticed the post by somebody in west virginia this morning. what they described sounds like what i saw, so i decided to post."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10172012-0014","Latitude":"39.321327","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43328.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43328_submitter_file2__17October2012005.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43328_submitter_file3__object.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43328.html"]}
