I was looking at it toward the north from south. It was brighter than a star. Was not a plane or helicopter. Just sitting between the trees later I came back to look it was gone. Could someone help me with this object. It's not the space station it's too low. Planes were passing right by it. Nobody has helped me with this sighting. I know my aircraft really well. This was not your normal airplane or helicopter. Everytime I see it it's in a different position. I want an email back on this sighting.
