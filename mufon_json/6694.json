My father was out plowing late one night in the fall when all of a sudden directly over head, a very intense bright white light just came on. He said it lite up the tractor and the plow and the ground all around it. He was plowing with an old 400 farmall with a3-bottom plow. He said it went from night to day because it was so bright. He was scared so he took the plow out of the ground and took off for the farm yard. He said the light came on for a few seconds then went off. My father is 64 now, he never said anything about this untilseveral years later. It took place 4 miles north and 1 mile west of Algona Ia. He never drank anykind of alcohol at this point of his life. He worked full time at Universal Mgf. Co. at the time. He was helping a farmer when this took place. I just got the web so I thought I would pass this on to you. I could possibly find out more about this incident if you would want more infomation."],"Summary":"very bright light came on over top of tractor out plowing around 1:am in the morning","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.069966,+-94.233019(6694)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6694) map </A>","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Algona","There were no other sightings in Algona on or around September 30th 1969"],"City":"Algona"}
