based on your description, what you saw is most likely such-and-such.\" posted on 07\\07\\09 @ ~11:20pm on topix.com (bartlett, il forum): \"sweet! someone else who saw the same thing we did, and you had 30 in your group! like i said, i'm not trying to start some kind of ufo conspiracy. i would just like to find out what i saw. if there is a reasonable, terrestrial explanation, i would be happy with that. however, there is nothing in my mind and experience that i could compare these lights to and think, \"oh, that's what that was.\" and i don't mean to sound like these were some sort of bright, intense, other-worldly lights that made your jaw drop and exclame, \"we are not alone!\" these were just odd lights in the sky that didn't fit in with the rest of the lights in the sky that i would expect to see in everyday normal life. they behaved oddly, and i cannot logically equate what i saw with anything that i have seen before. normally, if i were to see lights in the sky, especially if there were numerous ones in a formation, i would just assume they were planes lining up for landing at o'hare (given that i live in a reasonable proximty to the o'hare airport area). however, the lights from planes have a tendency to move in the sky as they descend and approach the runway. also, planes (and other aircraft) have blinking lights. the lights i saw in the sky were fairly stationary or moved very, very slowly. there were no corresponding blinking lights associated with the orangeish balls that would indicate they were aircraft. after about 10-15 minutes, the light would slowly dim out and disappear. as i am currently typing this, my wife is on her pc searching for these same type of observations. apparently, there have been a ton of these sightings within the il, mi, in, wi area over this past weekend. i need to look into this more and see what other people are reporting. my wife is looking at reports at www.mufon.com . i really wish that the forums on topix.com had a wider readership so that i could get responses from more people.\""],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 09:20 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07082009-0002","Longitude":"-88.17694","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Bartlett","There were no other sightings in Bartlett on or around July 4th 2009"],"Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.999028,+-88.17694(17930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17930) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 09:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"orange-red glowing Mars-like ball high in the sky faintly dimming in and out","Case Number":"17930","Latitude":"41.999028"}
