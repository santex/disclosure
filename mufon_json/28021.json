{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on a bench waiting for a bus, when I looked up in the sky in front of me, and saw a object that looked like a white balloon, yet it didn't move around like a balloon, and moved in a straight line of its own volition, I watched it come from the N to south, heading over the ocean. It went behind me, and I didn't see it anymore. This was in Long Beach, CA about 7 am in the morning. I just watched it and didn't know what it was, it had no wings, and didn't divert from its flight path."],"Country":"United States","City":"Long Beach","Tags":"City","Case Number":"28021","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Long Beach","There were no other sightings in Long Beach on or around February 27th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.153586","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"02/27/2011 07:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.811807,+-118.153586(28021)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28021) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28021.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28021.html"],"Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-02272011-0009","Date Submitted":"02/27/2011 04:54 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"saw at 4th and orange n to s looked like white balloon","Latitude":"33.811807"}
