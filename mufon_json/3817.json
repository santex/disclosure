The object appeared to hover about 2-300 ft above the field. It was very shiny and after approximately 3 minutes it flew off in the opposit direction and in a mere second had vanished from sight. At first I thought it was an airplane but dismissed that because it was stationary for the time I saw it until it took off. The last thing on my mind was that I was seeing a UFO, but after consideration its the only thing it could have been."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Case Number":"3817"}
