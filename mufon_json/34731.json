{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was spring time in 2008 when my sister and I witnessed something strange over the fields in plainsboro. My sister, Aimee, had picked me up from work one night. I was driving home with her in the passenger seat when I spotted an orange sphere that looked like it was on fire except without flames. We both were in awe because it was like nothing we had ever seen. It was way up in the air, about the altitiude that airplanes fly. It made very abrupt and weird movements and left a trail of the same color behind it that never dissipated. It went up, then down, then right, then left, but it seemed like it was under some sort of control. We stayed for about five minutes, then left. It was still doing the same things when we left. We both went through what it possibly could have been, but came up with nothing."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"40.333091","Log Number":"US-01082012-0031","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.333091,+-74.593691(34731)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34731) map </A>","City":"Plainsboro","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"My sister and I saw a glowing orange sphere that left a crazy trail.","Longitude":"-74.593691","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"New Jersey","Date Submitted":"01/08/2012 11:24 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Plainsboro","There were no other sightings in Plainsboro on or around May 10th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34731.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34731.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"34731"}
