{"Case Number":"49770","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details This was a chance sighting, I have a security camera scanning the sky and then I spotted all these objects in formation, I went outside and then I can see them with the naked eye, in formation brights, but not point like, with a bluish color bright, this was at 4:15pm today, not two hours ago, and the sun was glaring, difficult to distinguish lots of details when the sun is almost in front of your face, objects pass overhead coming from the northeast and moved in formation going southwest. You can see birds and planes below them, they \"flew\" a little over cloud level. I run inside and got my Sony HD camcorder, but with the small viewfinder in this camcorder I just got a very short glimpse of these objects, at least can be seen in the Sony footage and eleven on the security camera footage. That video is attached with this report."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"08/12/2013 04:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49770.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49770.html"],"City":"Miami","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There was one other sighting in Miami on or around August 12th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-80.379081","Log Number":"US-08122013-0021","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Eleven objects in formation, recorded with two cameras.","Date Submitted":"08/12/2013 05:53 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.652504,+-80.379081(49770)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49770) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"25.652504","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown"}
