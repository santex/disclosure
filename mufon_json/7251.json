{"City":"Swansea","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my friend were sitting on a stair railing at the beach in Porthcawl (South Wales, UK) watching the waves out at sea while it started to get dark, I looked up and I could see a bright light coming over from the far distance, heading towards the sea remaining at similar height, (was flying about helicopter height), at first I thought it was a helicopter but as it came nearer the light got really, really bright and the shape became bigger, my friend was seing exactly the same as me, it was travelling really slow and something was like travelling just behind it then all of a sudden it zoomed really high in a diaganol direction and just stayed in the sky like a star, we just couldn't believe what we had saw, it made no noise and we tried taking pictures of it but it was so small in the sky it just looked like a tiny star. We hung around a bit and we were both shaken up, we rang family and friends etc, some made a joke about it and some believed us but you just had to be there to witness it. It just stayed there then almost all night until we went home."],"Log Number":"GB-06192007-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.62144,+-3.943646(7251)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7251) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/16/2007 09:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/16/2007 09:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"It was too bright to see the shape","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Wales","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United Kingdom","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-3.943646","Case Number":"7251","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7251.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7251.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Swansea","There were no other sightings in Swansea on or around June 16th 2007"],"Latitude":"51.62144"}
