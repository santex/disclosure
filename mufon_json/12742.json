{"Region":"New Jersey","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving down Penwell on my way to Rt 57W on my way to Lopatcong. As I came to a clearing in the woods I saw a huge, dull gray blimp. It appeared to be about five miles from me, over some farm land. I lost sight of it as I entered the woods again. In about 3 to five minutes I was out of the woods and entered Rt 57W. I had a clear view in all directions but could not spot the blimp. I continued on through Washington and made my way, looking in all directions for the blimp, until I came to my destination in Lopatcong. I never saw it again. I keep puzzling over how a blimp could have moved that fast. Did anyone else see it? There were no markings on it. It was most likely a blimp. But I can't explain the speed or the lack of markings. I also don't recall seeing a passenger carrier underneath it. It appeared to be motionless at the time I saw it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.758433,+-74.979338(12742)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12742) map </A>","Object Shape":"Blimp","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12742.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12742.html"],"City":"Washington","Latitude":"40.758433","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-09232008-0011","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around July 31st 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-74.979338","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"dull metallic gray","Case Number":"12742","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"07/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
