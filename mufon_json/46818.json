At first I thought it was a star coming into sight because it was close to sunset time. I pulled out my phone and started recording it is very noticeable that the object flickered then appeared from behind cloud. I tried to follow it as long as I could and sorry for the quality it is a phone.I did go to otherside of the building to try and record it more but it was gone. I had no different feeling's during the event I just thought to myself cool I finally got one. :) Sorry about the zooming I was trying hard to get a better close up. Please dont tell me this was the ISS I know for a fact the ISS doesn't fly at cloud level."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/15/2013 08:33 UTC","Longitude":"-122.880827","Summary":"Can someone tell me what it is?
