Just as I was crossing the San Jacinto river, I was drawn to a reflection in the sky and some distance away. I first assumed that it was the underbelly reflection of a high altitude commercial jet leaving or coming into Bush Intercontinental Airport. No sooner than that thought entered my head, that the reflection seemed to disappear as though an invisible vaccum cleaner sucked it away toward the west. I looked for the jet thinking it had just turned away from the sunsreflection, but there was nothing in the sky period, not even a cloudin that portion of the sky. I do not know if anyone else saw this or not Traffic was light and I did not stop, but I did slow down trying to see a jet in the sky around where that bright reflection had been. I am still trying to decide if I really saw what I saw or making something out of nothing. I thought by reporting to you, you could tell me if anyone else has reported any UFO activity around Houston lately I would really appreciate some kind of reply please."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"1945","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/16/2002 12:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","City":"Houston"}
