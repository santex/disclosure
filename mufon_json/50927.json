This happened for about 4 minutes. The beam was the same as a spot light but the light was not coming from the ground. The light seemed to be coming from above the clouds above my neighbors house. I didn't see anyone with a flashlight or any type of light pointing at the sky. I called my son to see if he noticed anything unusual about the sky and he immediately that the light was coming from above the clouds."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Voilet light beam scanning clouds","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"31.973009","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-99.896083","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"N/A","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50927.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50927.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
