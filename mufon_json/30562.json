{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsLeft work at a shop in Hemlock michigan around 6:00pm i was going south on Hemlock Rd. When I noticed a triangle craft flying over my car. I only seen it for maybe 3 to 5 seconds and could not stop due to the shoulder of the road. I tried to turn and look for it when it passed but the veiw was blocked due to a tree line. I was traveling about 55 mph. The craft had the classic lights in each corner and a red light in the middle. It had the same metalic color as a plane and was not black. I thought it was pretty cool to see. Hope to see another one."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Richland","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30562.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30562.html"],"Latitude":"43.414749","Log Number":"US-08062011-0038","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 12:27 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Richland","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-84.23054","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"30562","Summary":"Triangle craft seen coming home from work","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"12/28/2006 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.414749,+-84.23054(30562)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30562) map </A>"}
