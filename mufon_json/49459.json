{"Summary":"Unknown Object at very high altitude over Kingsland Texas on 08/03/2013","divs":["sighting detailson saturday, 08\\03\\2013, i was sitting outside on our deck with my wife. we both, about the same time saw a glowing object to the southwest of our location. the object was at a very high altitude and moving to the northeast very fast. at first we thought maybe military but the size was too big. maybe an astroid. the object continued on an approximate heading of 075 degrees until we lost sight as the object was lost in the terminator. the object was high enough that the only light we were able to see was the reflection of the sun off of the object. i asked my wife if she saw any strobes, she did not. i saw no strobes either."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.66462,+-98.438915(49459)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49459) map </A>","City":"Kingsland","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"None, Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Kingsland","There was one other sighting in Kingsland on or around August 3rd 2013"],"Latitude":"30.66462","Date Submitted":"08/04/2013 07:06 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Date of the Event":"08/03/2013 11:25 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49459.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49459.html"],"Log Number":"US-08042013-0033","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"49459","Longitude":"-98.438915","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
