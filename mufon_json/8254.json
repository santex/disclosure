It appeared to be flashing red, blue and white as if it was rotating. It did not appear to be moving in any direction, just sitting in one spot. I watched it for a while and there was no change. I came back out later to see if it could have been a star that had moved. I could not locate the object about 30 minutes after the initial sighting."],"City":"Benton","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/29/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Rotating object flashing red, white and blue/purple in rotation","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
