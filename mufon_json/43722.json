At first he thought he saw a huge bird soaring above him but said he didn't notice wing movement ... then thought it was an airplane, but heard nothing for it being so close. He noted that it blended well with the many clouds in the sky ... I said he should report it to you, but he declined. Yesterday I searched your database and saw a VERY SIMILAR sighting the same night in Denver and decided to post my husband's sighting. No photos ... He HAS had many other sightings I his lifetime."],"Log Number":"US-11052012-0015","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.926786,+-105.145286(43722)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43722) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.926786","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43722.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43722.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Case Number":"43722","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/03/2012 11:45 UTC","Longitude":"-105.145286","City":"Broomfield","Tags":"City"}
