There was a plane-like object on the same trajectory that dissapeared at the same time the lantern-thing vanished. The Airplane-ish object was clearly much higher than the lantern-ish obeject, though after they vanished, other airplanes were flying in a normal flight line. It happened very fast, maybe 30 to 45 seconds."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.645708,+-3.010113(25328)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25328) map </A>","City":"Southport","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25328.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25328.html"],"Case Number":"25328","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/07/2010 01:42 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/07/2010 06:20 UTC","Summary":"Chinese-type lantern with dangling line and higher elevated fireball entity following.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United Kingdom","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"53.645708"}
