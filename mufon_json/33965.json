I was just waking up, and she was outside looking at something. I asked her what she was looking at, and she motioned for me to look at the sky. It was fairly cool outside, so i decided that i would hang out of the window. What i saw amazed me. I saw a large disc-like object hovering in the night sky, too bright to be a star. All of a sudden, it quickly accelerated to unknown speeds, then stopped, and sort of started to do loops in the sky, then as i started to get out my digital camera, it flashed and disappeared."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"08/12/2010 03:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-114.734731","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"33965","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.076732","Date Submitted":"12/11/2011 05:52 UTC","Summary":"Floated around, no sound"}
