They were not in any way associated with the rocket, and they were most definitely not rocket boosters. My neighbor and I have seen these objects again on July 19th at around 8:00 PM. One was flying above the other and moving in a similar direction to the first sighting. I watched as the perspective on the object shifted from a cigar to a point on the horizon, indicating that it did indeed have shape and was moving."],"Date of the Event":"04/05/2010 06:24 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"28.071683"}
