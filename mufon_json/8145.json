The other aircraft in the air at that time seemed not to be bothered by it as some flew near. Since I did not see the body of this craft that did not make a sound,and the fact that it had lights at its corners made me think that it was man made. I mean why would a craft like this show running lights. I and my wife saw this as I awoke her to show her this. Now since I have seen this, I would of loved to see its body. Had I had forsight I would have taken a picture and used an opical device to look at it."],"Region":"New Jersey","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8145.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8145.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.983102,+-74.95894(8145)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8145) map </A>"}
