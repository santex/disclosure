{"Summary":"wife and I saw two green lights above us","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/22/2012 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I was laying on the trampoline in the back yard watching for the meteor shower and she said look look. I figured it was a meteor but when I looked I observed two dim green glowing lights going backwards and forwards. It made no sound that we heard and it was only a couple hundred feet in the air. We watched it for about 30 secs until the lights was gone. I never could make out an object just the two lights which I figured was the bottom of the craft since it went directly above us. The lights seem to be oval shape with black waves through them. Glowing dimly and pulsating."],"Case Number":"37709","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","City":"Paducah","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-88.5836","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Paducah","There were no other sightings in Paducah on or around April 22nd 2012"],"Latitude":"37.067836","Region":"Kentucky","Log Number":"US-04242012-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37709.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37709.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.067836,+-88.5836(37709)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37709) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/24/2012 09:51 UTC"}
