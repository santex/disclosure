I made an extensive report, which is still under investigation. This happened in the same place I am now. Someone suggested I take random pictures and see what happens. This is what happened. You can see the pictures. I don't know what these things are, and I can post only 3 at a time. Maybe someone with really good picture analysis ability can figure it out.
