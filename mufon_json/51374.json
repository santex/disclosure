It was very dark around 9PM and there was no other traffic. In front of us, about 100 feet, this amazingly large dark object with yellow lights was just above tree line and was crossing over the road. It traveled from south to north at just above tree level. The size was enormous. My daughter asked me what it was and I've never seen anything like it so I had no answer. It made no noticeable noise for its size and did no damage to the trees. It disappeared into the tree line. It all happened so fast and we were both so shocked we did not get a picture."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-120.180053","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.336902,+-120.180053(51374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51374) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
