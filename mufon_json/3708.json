I saw a faint light moving across the sky over the highway in the distance out of the corner of my eye. At first I thought it was a satellite but it was moving quite rapidly. It made its way across the highway and then came to a complete stop for a few seconds and then went in the opposite direction just as fast as the first time and then came to another complete stop and hovered there until I drove past and couldn't see it anymore. I thought at first it could be an airplane but what type of an airplane comes to a complete stop in midair and sits there. Then I thought maybe it was a helicopter but it was flying at a very high altitude and quit fast for a helicopter and a helicopter usually flys lower to the ground and you can usually tell its a helicopter by the brighter solid light and slower speed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3708.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3708.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"08/05/2005 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Savannah","There were no other sightings in Savannah on or around August 5th 2005"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.126478,+-81.204727(3708)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3708) map </A>","Case Number":"3708","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO"}
