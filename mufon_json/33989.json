It then began to flash randomly, red, red, white,. white, red, white, etc. It went just red for a while. It moved abruptly, hovered, stopped, then changed direction. It went on for about 15 minutes. I thiought this can't be a plane, it is not moving like a helicopter. It then went over the tree line, but it was like it was floating up and down gently. It was off in the distance; it was hard to tell how far. It was really strange. I wasn't outside so I couldn't tell if it was making a noise or not, but planes flying by made noise that I could hear. This was not making audible sounds that I could tell. It flew in from the southwest, turned, and began heading in a northwesterly direction. Then it disappeared."],"City":"Suffield","Latitude":"41.983811","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Suffield","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-72.682383","Case Number":"33989","Date Submitted":"12/12/2011 07:36 UTC"}
