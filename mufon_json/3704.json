It looked like a glowing blimp shaped object slowly moving east. i just stared at it trying to figure what it was.I went to a friend house to show them they all went outside and couldnt explain what it was either.we followed it down the street on foot until it went behind trees in the distance and we lost track of it.The night was a clear night."],"Date Submitted":"07/31/2005 01:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3704.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3704.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"3704","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Warren","There were no other sightings in Warren on or around July 31st 2005"],"Object Shape":"Blimp","Longitude":"-83.020967","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
