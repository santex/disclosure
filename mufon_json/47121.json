It almost looked like a plane was coming towards us with all the lights, but it never moved. We went home and our house was the direction towards it, but it never got bigger. This was all around 9:00pm. I was not very scared, I thought it was cool. I am not saying this is in fact a UFO, but I do not know what it was."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"None","City":"Harrisburg","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47121.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47121.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Harrisburg","There were no other sightings in Harrisburg on or around May 1st 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/01/2013 09:08 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.28244,+-76.874548(47121)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47121) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/02/2013 07:24 UTC","Case Number":"47121"}
