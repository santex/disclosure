My grandparents and my parents were playing cards in the dining room. My grandpa told me to take the trash out to the curb. I went outside to the curb in front of my house. Something compelled me to look up. When I did I saw a large, glowing yellow, triangular ship above the tree. It wasn't moving or making any sound. I could only see the back of it because the tree obstructed the rest of my view. Right away I knew it was a UFO, so I started examining it. The bottom of the craft was covered in some sort of hieroglyphics, but it was all just lines connecting to dots. All of a sudden I blacked out, and the next thing I remember was having my hand on the front doorknob, already in mid turn. I walked in and said nothing. I don't know what time it was when I got back, but it couldn't have been to long. After that I had a small circular object in my right ear lobe that wasn't there before."],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/15/1995 08:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in South Bend","There were no other sightings in South Bend on or around July 15th 1995"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.688781,+-86.244577(25740)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25740) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"South Bend","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I went outside, saw a large yellow triangle above a tree, then blacked out.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
