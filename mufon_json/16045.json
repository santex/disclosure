It was silent and flew over Fairbanks Alaska at 12:51 am and was in full view for one minute then flew very fast towards the north east of Fairbanks, I chased it with my car but gave up very quickly after reaching 90mph and it was very obvious I never had a chance to keep up. I do not think our fastest jets could have touched this thing! It went so fast it it was like it just faded away ........... I saw it fly over going towards the north east of Fairbanks I was leaving Walmart when I first seen it, I could not help but see it because of the size and color I knew it was not a plane or helicopter. I was scared at first then I got very excited but really was wishing for my video camera and regular camera which I will carry every where I go now."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=64.839178,+-147.714409(16045)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16045) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Other","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03162009-0003","Summary":"Blue football pointed both ends round in mid.
