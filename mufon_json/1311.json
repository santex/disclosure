My wife witnessed one of the circles and direction changes. Mywife left for work, and I continued to watch the object for an additional 10-15minutesduring which time the object repeated the circle26 direction change 3 more times. I lost sight of the object about 15 degreesabove the SE horizon due to city lights 10 miles away and approaching dawn. I ama retired Army aviator, and an avid amateur astronomer. In all my time in thesky and watching the sky, I have never seen anything like this. The size, color,perceived altitude, direction changes, and speed are inconsistent with any typeof aircraft, satellite, weather balloon, astronomical or environmental event. Iwould be very interested to know if this object was observed by anyone else."],"Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1311.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Copperas Cove","Longitude":"-97.903078","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Date of the Event":"09/14/2001 05:55 UTC"}
