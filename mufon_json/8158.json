There is a very large window in my second floor apartment. I turned off the television about 9:30 p.m. and went to the window to see if I could discover whether the clouds had cleared. These ���clouds��� had been in the making all day by the double-barreled tanker planes that produce chemtrails. I was checking the sky because I was hoping to be able to open the windows to let in some fresh air. Since I just recently found information on chemtrails and am still learning about this, I wasn���t sure that it was safe to have my windows open if the ���chem-clouds��� were still there. While I was peering out the window into the dark sky, trying to determine whether I could see anything, a very large mass of light passed behind a chem-cloud showing me that, in fact, the chemtrails were still there. I would call this a ���ball��� of light, except the mass was diffused behind the chem-cloud so I couldn���t see any precise shape to it. But my guess was that it was a ���ball��� of light. It didn���t make any sound. This wasn���t like anything I have ever seen before. Stars and planets and planes all have small points of sparkling light that are either stationary or traveling in a mostly straight path. This light was many times larger, like a huge cotton ball sliding down a winding path in order to stay behind the curved chem-cloud, swooping like a giant bird, covering much more distance than a plane. Its motion appeared almost playful. It appeared in the east and swooped to the west. As soon as it was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another one appeared in the east and swooped to the west like it was following the same identical winding path to stay hidden behind the chem-cloud. When that one was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another appeared. It finally dawned on me that I should start counting. So I can���t be positive, but I think that there were approximately 6 in all and identical in size, light, and path���except for the last one. That one surprised me when it got to the west side, because it turned slightly and came back a short distance before it disappeared."],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-10172007-0001","Latitude":"44.97678","Tags":"City","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-92.74712","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
