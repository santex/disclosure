I went out to get it and I stepped out side and looked up at the moon, I noticed a bright star and I was drawn to it and kept looking at it. I then thought it must be a plane but it was still and not moving at all. I looked closer and I noticed it was circular and I thought oh shi* its not a plane I ran in the house and grabbed my cell phone. as I started recording, the object moved very fast to the left of the moon then down and up back to the right of the moon. It kept moving and I knew it wasnt a plane! or a shooting star. it kept moving back and fourth up and down it was amazing! Then it stopped for a while and just disapeared. I forgot that I needed something from the car and just went inside and went to sleep."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12429.html"],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Goleta","There were no other sightings in Goleta on or around September 9th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"12429","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.439489,+-119.821359(12429)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12429) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"34.439489","Source":"MUFON"}
