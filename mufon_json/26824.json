My home backs up to several acres of nothing but woods. No homes near the object sighting. I was getting up from bed to let my dog out the back to go to the bathroom when I reached for the patio door to open it. As soon as I looked otside I saw a huge ball of flame shoot upward from the ground about 10 ft. behind the trees which are about 400 ft. from my house. I had a very clear shot. It rose straight upward then made a complete turn toward the top of my house and it completely vanished. It was completely silent. By the time I hurried to the front of the house, it was gone. I know it definately was not a shooting star because it rose from the ground straight upward."],"City":"Knoxville","Date of the Event":"08/31/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"Tennessee","Latitude":"35.968578","Date Submitted":"12/02/2010 03:06 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
