It faced south towards the Potomac. It was a clear evening and the stars were out. One in particular in the SE caught my eye as it seemed to be moving. It was far away and smaller compared, and at first I thought it might be an airplane or jet. It moved parallel to the sky, then stopped for a moment. As I watched, it then zipped back the other way so fast at about 45 degrees that there was no way that it could have been any type of air vehicle I knew of. It moved entirely too fast! I then didn't see it anymore. I couldn't believe what I had seen and tried to wake my husband to tell him about it."],"Date of the Event":"11/30/1999 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14436","Summary":"Moved too fast to be a jet or airplane.","Region":"District of Columbia","City":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14436.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14436.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.903862,+-77.032566(14436)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14436) map </A>"}
