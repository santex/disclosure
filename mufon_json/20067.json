To the naked eye they appeared like a burred cluster. With binoculars they were clearly not birds or any other known aircraft. I have seen these before. I was sitting in my backyard having a cigarette and was on the telephone looking up when I noticed them. I frequently see objects in the sky so am aware when I spot an unusual object. The objects were flying in a straight line and passed over in less than a minute. I mentioned what I was seeing to the person on the other end of the telephone call and mentioned that I was running indoors to get the binoculars. I gave them a play by play. The object went out of sight when they passed beyond my vantage point."],"Region":"California","Summary":"PEARL STRAND"}
