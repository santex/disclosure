if it was something else, how did it get there without somebody seeing it move into position? it was located to the left (south) of the setting sun and a bit higher in the sky and i got a good look at it while i was driving at a higher elevation. as i lost elevation, the trees along the side of the highway prevented me from seeing it except on occasion. it was the only thing in the sky except for the sun. it was a single object, shaped like a ���v��� but the arms were kind of puffy and the ���v��� was not upright but tilted over so that the hinge of the arms was on the left side of the thing like this: <. the puffiness of it made me wonder if it was a cloud, but there was something unusual about it, and there was nothing else near it or in the entire sky for that matter, except the sun. it was about three quarters of an inch at arms length, maybe an inch at the most. it did not appear to be moving relative to the sun. the color was unusual in my opinion because it was intensely white. i was thinking that it should be reflecting some of the golden\\orange sunlight, but there was no hint of any other color other than the intense white. this is subjective, but it seemed to be so white that i thought it was glowing of its own accord���there were no beams or individual points of light���just an overall intense white color. i lost track of it for several minutes while on the highway due to the trees and trying to drive safely. i got off the highway and headed south toward hyannis, trying to catch a glimpse of it but i couldn���t see it for 2 or 3 minutes. still heading south, i saw it again as i came to a place where the trees were thin along the right side of the road and it opened up into the flat expanse of the airport field. this was maybe 7 minutes after i first caught sight of it. it was still in a ���v��� shape, but now the hinge was on the bottom (like a v). the thing had rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise relative to its original position. it also appeared that the right arm was behind the left, somewhat closing up the empty space between the arms a bit. the sun had set at this point and the sky was still bright. the ���cloud��� was still white but dimmer, not as intensely white as it had been a couple of minutes previously. clouds morph and this could very well have been something like that, but it was unusual, appearing rather suddenly and so intensely white. how many clouds rotate like that and keep their shape? i lost track of it as it was obscured by the buildings and trees of hyannis and i did not see it when i got home. when i was on the highway and had a good look at it, i got the sense that it was visible over a large area. somebody else must have seen it because it was the only thing in the western sky other than the sun, and it was a lovely sunset that would have drawn peoples��� attention. maybe a quick glance would have drawn the conclusion of a cloud, and maybe it was. but keeping shape after rotating is puzzling to me. i have no certainty about this bit it seemed like it was big or maybe even immense and farther away, rather than smaller and closer. it was to the south west, on a line from hyannis out to the nantucket sound, then toward martha���s vineyard (most likely the eastern half of the island), and then on to the open ocean to the south of block island, or even farther. it could have been located at any point along that line. i don't think i can offer any more than this. i am an avid sky watcher, and i can say that this was unusual enough for me to provide this report."],"Object Shape":"Chevron","Date of the Event":"02/06/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["there have been no other sightings in dennis\\yarmouth\\barnstabl","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-10092012-0007","City":"Dennis/Yarmouth/Barnstabl","Date Submitted":"10/09/2012 02:39 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-70.217021","Latitude":"41.689833","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.689833,+-70.217021(43114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43114) map </A>","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"43114","Summary":"Unusual intensely white \"cloud\" in the sky at sunset"}
