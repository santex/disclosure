{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home to Morton back from Peoria when a light in the sky caught my attention . That's when I realized there were two glowing orbs . They were aprox 100 yards apart . Staying exactly in line with one another. I watched them for about 15 mins they didn't moved but suddenly just faded away until I could no longer see them. Being night and the fact I was driving its hard to judge how far away the objects were. I couldn't make out any details other than shape and colors. So I suspect at least a few miles . Similar has been sited in this area several times in the last year or so. This I'd the second UFO I've seen in a year as well. The other was a triangle not a orb like these."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in East Peoria","There were no other sightings in East Peoria on or around February 23rd 2013"],"Region":"Illinois","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-89.571488","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/24/2013 05:13 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"East Peoria","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02242013-0014","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/23/2013 09:30 UTC","Case Number":"45865","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45865.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45865.html"],"Latitude":"40.675499","Summary":"2 glowing metallic orbs floating in the sky.
