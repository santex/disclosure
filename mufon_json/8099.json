it was soo bright (comparatively) then burned out almost as soon as it hit ground-level. the less bright one (still pretty bright though) just hovered, and they eventually continued their little pattern... there were a couple of times they were both completely faded out, for at least five minutes. i waited and watched, and sure enough, another one would appear. at points, i could see both burning bright and clear for about a minute or so at a time. there were also two instances where one would appear to the upper left of the other, approx. the same distance away as i'd estimate according to their little pattern. the whole time, i noticed about 60-70 degrees above in the sky, there was a very bright 'star' emitting white light, which was also flickering\\wavering. it was the brightest 'star' in the sky, besides from the amber 'orbs'. it would sometimes go right out and then reappear a couple of seconds later. i could still see the stars next to it when it went out, so it wasn't being covered by clouds. in fact it shone soo bright, i could see it right through the thin ceiling-clouds we had. for some reason, i'm left with the impression it was some sort of 'mother ship' or something, i'm not sure. i am, however, pretty sure it was related to whatever was happening. the last few minutes of this sighting were rather uneventful, the last 'orb' continued the same pattern, but i didn't notice anything shoot off of it when it appeared. it eventually just fizzled out entirely. i waited approx. 10 minutes to see if another would appear, but to no avail. this was certainly one of the most profound moments of my life. i knew there was something else out there, i just never believed people would ever see such a thing. now i believe, and i actually have a couple of pictures and movie clips to prove what i saw. yeah, i'm a little nuts, but i can prove what i saw, and i also have two eye-witnesses who saw the same thing i did."],"Date Submitted":"10/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"CA-10102007-0001","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.879685","Country":"Canada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8099.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8099_submitter_file1__ufos.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8099_submitter_file2__ufos2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8099.html"]}
