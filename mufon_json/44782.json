Object emitted a vapor that disipated quickly from the tail of the craft. I was facing west as the object slowed to a hover over large power lines that run downhill. I can see inside my house the telivision was dimming and the cable reception was garbled. After the item was out of sight to the North a pair of helicopters flew over the house-one heading south and the other helicopter north after the object. The object was silent and pretty large and moved smoothly across the ridge in anadel state park."],"Date Submitted":"12/25/2012 06:53 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.437914,+-122.5898(44782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44782) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/05/2012 08:05 UTC","Latitude":"38.437914","Country":"United States"}
