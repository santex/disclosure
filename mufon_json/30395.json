The first night there was 14 in the sky at the same time. On the 4th in new britian ct we saw 6 in the sky at the same time. On the 23rd there were 3 in the sky very close to the house huge pulsing red and orange making no noise at all. I live in the flight path to BDL airport in hartford and know exactly what a jet and private plane look like in the sky these are 20-30x the size of the planes. Planes going to bradley typically take a direct diagonal line over our house every day every night. This night after the sighting the plance took a 90 degree angle around the air space above our house immediatley after the sighting. I am very curious to find out what your thoughts are on what is happening here in ct."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30395.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30395.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08072011-0052","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.532899","Object Shape":"Fireball","Summary":"Multiple sightings starting around June 26th - 7/23"}
