Looked out the window to see a large orb shaped object. Orb glowing very bright light hovering over the tree line. The orb dimmed and I could see amber color lights near bottom of the object. Orb would get bright again, and seemed to beem lights into cabin. Looking through binos it appeared to me a metalic gold color. No sound, but some battery opperated tools in the cabin did come on without me turning them on. I was wiht my 5 year old son, and did not see anyone on the river that day. After about 30 minutes I did hear many gunshots. Later in the night it appeared that something moved accross the deck of the cabin (tall dark, standing upright)? 30 more minutes and more gun shots. I only had 4 beers during a 5 hour period. This is not the first time I have seen something like this."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/18/2009 01:56 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-10182009-0004"}
