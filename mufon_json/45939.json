playing with sidewalk chalk at a friend���s home. 2. what made you first notice the object? a shadow was casted across us on a pretty clear day. 3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? i didn���t really think about the object other then i wanted to touch it and was curious. it wasn���t threatening or scary. i actually felt confused, comforted, and curious. 4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. teardrop, metallic, reflective, smooth, (solid yet fluid like), no visible lights or hard body shape. just a smooth tear form. it seemed like the point of the tear was the front and it got thicker and rounder in the back. it seems like they could see us but we couldn���t really see them through the pulsing bottom. also the front of the tear drop seemed to be more liquid and clear like. 5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. while it was there: we had no fear, calm, curious, shocked, and confused. when it left: really confused, shocked, and scared just because we couldn���t explain it and make anyone understand. 6. how did you lose sight of the object? first lost sight because it seemed to fly under a cloud and then up through it. it then peeked out above the cloud. second time we lost sight because of the trees and houses across the street."]}
