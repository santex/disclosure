Everyday myself and my co-teacher would take the 2 and 3 year olds outside to play. It was a little after 11:00a.m. We looked up in the sky to the southwest of us and there was this ball of fire hovering in the sky. It was not moving at all...just sitting there. It was not that high up either. Not as high as a plane would be, just above the treeline. We kept staring and even a few of the children pointed and said \"fire\". I had never seen anything like it. It was not a plane, it had no material to support it was any type of spacecraft. Finally, after roughly 3 minutes it took off at about a 45 degree angle and vanished. I have never seen anything like it in my life and neither had my co teacher."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Normal","There were no other sightings in Normal on or around May 31st 2008"],"City":"Normal","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/31/2008 11:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21169.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21169.html"],"Latitude":"40.515873","Country":"United States","Summary":"Fireball in the sky","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Case Number":"21169","Longitude":"-88.981771","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Date Submitted":"12/26/2009 09:26 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City"}
