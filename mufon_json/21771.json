My boyfriend and I saw a light at the same time. It appeared to be moving North just above the trees. It abruptly turned (way too quickly for a plane and without banking at all) and moved south back the way it had come. We lost sight of it behind the buildings and trees. I kept a look out for anything once we were driving in an open area. I noticed two planes that seemed to be slowly circling above Sparta, but nothing else. Whatever it was, it was lower to the ground than a plane normally flies. I would have dismissed this event if not for the fact that I saw a similar object about a mile West of this location in 1996."],"Date of the Event":"02/03/2010 09:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"bright light/orb","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sparta","There were no other sightings in Sparta on or around February 3rd 2010"],"Case Number":"21771","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.160858,+-85.710039(21771)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21771) map </A>","City":"Sparta","Log Number":"US-02042010-0004","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/04/2010 12:51 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
