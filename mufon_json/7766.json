In my backyard in South San Jose near highways 85 and 87 at approximately 1:00am Sunday morning. I was stargazing. 2.) I was already looking up at the night sky. 3.) At first I thought it was a flashlight or searchlight coming across the bottom of the cloud, but then I realized there was no beam coming from the ground upwards, and that the \"light\" remained just as bright even when it passed through the cloudless part of the night sky. 4.) I was amazed I could not see any physical object as I could see clouds and stars \"through\" it, as though it was invisible except for it's vapor trail. 5.) It moved very seiftly across the sky. There was no sound like from a plane or helicopter, and it was not like a solid ball of light as you might expect from a comet or meteorite. 6.) It eventually seemed to disappear into the clouds where I lost track of it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348376,+-121.891316(7766)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7766) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/22/2007 01:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"7766","Log Number":"US-08282007-0003","Object Features":"None","City":"San Jose","Date of the Event":"07/22/2007 01:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were 2 other sightings in San Jose on or around July 22nd 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"37.348376","Longitude":"-121.891316","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Summary":"Witness discribed a \"wierd Illuminated trail\", but definitely not an aircraft."}
