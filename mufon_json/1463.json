It was afluke that I saw it at all, because I just happened to look up and I saw verybright, kinda egg shaped object shoot across the sky. It didnt stay around forlong but I watched as it disapeared behind the houses across the street. It wasgoing very fast and Im not really sure what it was. It could have been the kindof UFO you are interested in but Im not sure. I thought though that I ought toat least report it just in case. Even if I had have a camera with me that nightI wouldnt have had time to photograph it. I really did see something. My familythinks Im crazy but I saw something. Whether it was alien or not I cant say,but I know that it went very fast and was an odd shape."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Cedar Hill","There were no other sightings in Cedar Hill on or around December 20th 2001"],"Case Number":"1463","Latitude":"32.595959","Summary":"It was a bright egg shaped object.","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1463.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","City":"Cedar Hill","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.595959,+-96.949915(1463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1463) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/20/2001 10:15 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/20/2001 10:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":""}
