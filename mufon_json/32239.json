Light came from south east blinking white then red and each blink it was in a different spot 100-500 feet apart from the last blink, sometimes ending up 1000's of feet back in its origanal flight path. it would be in random spots each time it blinked, up down back and forward, continuing in a north east direction till it was gone. got that excited feeling in my chest. Seen same object at 6: 40 am but only white blinking on the same exact course."]}
