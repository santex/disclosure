It was a really bright blue light and seemed to be blinking from blue to purple and back to blue again. The object seemed to be randomly moving back and forth at various speeds, and as it's a bit harder to see in the video, was giving off a VERY bright light and would change from blue to purple at one point."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown,N/A","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Orlando","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/02/2013 12:00 UTC"}
