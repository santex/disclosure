Well today, i did just that. I was driving down pacific avenue in parkland when i noticed two unusually bright lights on the horizon. I kept driving for a mile, just watching these two objects stay stationary. As i drove closer, the orbs became bigger and i noticed them pulsating. I saw a passenger plane flying in the same skyline, and before i knew it one object moved right and then boom it disappeared. The 2nd object just appeared to hover and it looked stationary. A few miles later i noticed passengers around me had noticed the object. The man to my right had his face in his windshield trying to get a good look. Just when i thought i was getting close enough to see if it was a helicopter it moved away from my direction at a very quick speed and disappeared."],"Date of the Event":"07/21/2012 12:00 UTC","City":"Tacoma","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.262697,+-122.440551(41055)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41055) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Tacoma","There was one other sighting in Tacoma on or around July 21st 2012"],"Longitude":"-122.440551","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41055.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41055.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path"}
