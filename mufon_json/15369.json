{"divs":["Sighting DetailsPossible...Tryed to figure out some other reason for these things being in the picture but could not. We have had a long history of happenings. Call me crazy, but this piture is crazy to. All the pictures is not edited or filtered at 1200dpi scanned on a scanner from a photo that was stored for around 15 years. It is not faked. The first is the whole dark picture. The second is a section just left of my fathers face. The 3rd picture is of a section above that nearing the top of the window cover. If you look closly you will see what I see."],"Country":"Canada","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface","Date of the Event":"04/01/1994 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"CA-02072009-0010","Case Number":"15369","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Oshawa","Summary":"Brought up the brightness of an old picture and saw this.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.89626,+-78.85075(15369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15369) map </A>","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Oshawa","There were no other sightings in Oshawa on or around April 1st 1994","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"04/01/1994 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15369.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15369_submitter_file1__Image1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15369_submitter_file2__Image15.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15369_submitter_file3__Image16.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15369.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-78.85075","Latitude":"43.89626","Region":"Ontario"}
