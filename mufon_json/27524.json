It didn't make any noise, totally silent. I've never seen anything do that before, it totally looked like it flew up into outer space."],"Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"27524","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"01/26/2011 05:36 UTC","Region":"Florida","City":"Clearwater","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"27.977242","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
