{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was Friday the 22nd of October 2005. We ( my dad, sister, and me ) watched a bright star twinkle at the top of the sky. my sister and I went inside to get something to eat and to look at halloween costumes. Then we went back outside and all of the sudden it shot down across the sky and stopped near another star. It then started moving slowly away from the star. it got brighter and changed from an orange color to a bright green. then the color faded away.
