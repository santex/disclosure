HUGE, BLACK, isosceles triangle with the nose tipped up a bit was moving a snails pace above a cloud during rush hour traffic. It was coming from the West moving East, casting a shadow over the cloud, occasionally peeking out. This object was literally blocking out the sun. Rays of sunshine were highlighting the edges of the craft, it was so big I cannot imagine I was the only person to have noticed it, I went into the bank... came out it had only moved a little but was much less visible. There were also 3 helicopters moving in and out of the cloud."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.227883,+-110.923099(25643)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25643) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/01/2010 04:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25643.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25643.html"],"Log Number":"US-10022010-0002"}
