I was curious if they were affected by the cold and snow. They seemed not to be and looked to be playing in it. I then went to my back yard and notice a small blueish craft hovering inches above the snow. So I took a picture of it. I didn't notice that it was accompanied by others until I looked at it on my computer. I am starting to see a lot of them and I can't figure out why, I mean what iis the significance of this area? Well anyway I thought I'd better report it. Looked out my back window minutes later and didn't see it anymore."],"Longitude":"-94.486784","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.976154,+-94.486784(35788)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35788) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35788_submitter_file1__IMG_0955.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35788_submitter_file2__IMG_0955(2).jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35788.html"],"City":"Kansas City","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There was one other sighting in Kansas City on or around February 13th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Blue domed craft hovered inches above dog tracks","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02132012-0028"}
