When i came back outside 1-2 min later after getting my 7x35 zoom scope i viewed it glowing a very pretty blue for about 60 seconds when it blinked on & off for 2-3 seconds then disapeared before my eyes no clouds covered it at that time. I went outside later that night & it was still gone !!! P.S. My mother & i have seen this wierd star like object before, it tends to blink on & off and never moves across the sky like normal stars do though-out the night!"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.642588,+-122.660466(28209)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28209) map </A>","Region":"Washington","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28209.html"],"trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around March 12th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"03/12/2011 01:22 UTC","City":"Vancouver","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-03122011-0006","Source":"MUFON"}
