When I first saw this ufo I thought it could be a planet, it's quite clear in this part of England and there is good night skies in the country, The object in question stayed still for around 10 minutes, we got to a woody part of the field and this feeling of Terror, or great respect overcame me, which my friend started to feel, I almost felt as if I was being warned, I felt this terror almost like it was coming from within these woods I ignored this feeling and walked through, after half way through these woods I felt rather like my typical self again happy, and Good willed, me and my friend turned to look back up to the sky to see where the object had gone, there was a lot of cloud cover, but it still didn't appear, it was very windy throughout it all including before we came to see this object, I still accept the fact it could of been a planet, but the feeling of dread or terror was not a nice thing."],"Date Submitted":"01/19/2012 05:07 UTC"}
