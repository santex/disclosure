I watched as it slowly flew over the entire campground and eventually it took position right above the temple where every one was gathering, I pointed up to it with a laser and everyone around me saw the object pulse back. A lot of people saw this and a lot took video as well. It droped an orb right behind the temple and slowly moved away, then it hovered still for at least 5-8 minutes until eventually it just disintegrated or powered out at super fast speed."],"Date of the Event":"09/04/2011 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31605.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-09062011-0028"}
