details'i just happen to have a ufo experience that took place when i was a kid. the date is pretty foggy, but i'm fairly certain it was in the spring of 1991, when i was 11. i know for a fact that it took place before the big sighting that took place vienna\\brookfield area, near the airbase. i think this may be a long story, so be prepared. this took place around my family home in bristolville. my father was called away for military duty that weekend, and my mother worked the night shift, so us kids were alone. i invited a friend over, lying to his parents that my parents would be there. we planned to go out all night, wandering around, up to no good. that night, i believe around eleven at night, me, my brother, and my friend rode our bikes down the road about 5 miles into bristol center (what we were up to i plead the 5th). on our way back, we stopped in front of our house, and just rode around in circles, happy to be out at that late hour, being free, that sort of thing. well thats when it happened. i'm not sure who noticed it first...but we saw what i described then as a \"helicopter\" right above the treeline by my house. the thing was, we really didnt see a set shape of it, just a lot of lights on it, as if it were some kind of aircraft. the lights were not exceptionally bright, but there seemed to be way more of them than what you would generally see on an aircraft as small as it was (i mean small compared to a c-130 or passanger jet, this was roughly helicopter size). the problem was it was very low to the ground, maybe only a hundred feet. it also made no noise whatsoever. it slowly flew, in a straight trajectory (too fast to be a balloon or something, but too slow to be a chopper or plane), noiselessly, over our property, over the field across the street from our house, and it \"crashed\" as i remember saying, in the wooded area beyond the field (where there's a small clearing, and an old oil well). we all remarked that the thing definitely went down....and i suppose we couldnt imagine why anything would land here, at that hour, so we assumed it crashed for some reason. plus the clearing there was really too small for a helicopter to land in. i was an air force brat, as was my brother, so we both had quite a bit of knowledge of aircraft and their capabilities. oddly, my brother was extremely excited about this, yet me and my friend seemed really uninterested. my brother said he was going to go investigate what happened, but we both refused to go with him. i really do remember feeling generally uninterested in all of it, as was my friend. which seems odd as i always loved anything to do with aircraft, and i basically never saw any aircraft out where i lived, aside from jumbo jets and cargo planes 40,000 feet up in the air. so my lack of interest in it all really is surprising to me (especially seeing how much interest i've generated in the incident later in life). me and my friend went inside and played rampage on nes. i remember that because that was a game that took hours of play to get anywhere, and we played it for a very long time. until 3 in the morning is the number that sticks in my mind for some reason, and we thought nothing at all about my brother. it was several hours before he came back, and at that point we had totally forgotten he was even gone. i remarked to him that he had been gone a really long time, but he looked at me suspiciously and said he was only gone like 10 minutes, stating that he simply just rode his bike down to the old oil well trail, and then turned around and came back. i dont recall him saying anything about the \"helicopter\" that crashed either. i kind of dismissed him with a shrug, i thought maybe he was trying to \"mess with me\", so i just dropped it. at this point, for reasons i dont really remember, me and my friend decided to go outside. my memory is very hazy about this point. but i remember \"passing out\" and waking up. i was a kid, and the concept of loosing conciousness like that really disturbed me, and i realize thats what happened right away, and i wondered what in heck happened that made me do that. i was standing in our old shed now, and my friend was standing beside me....he was laughing hysterically. i remember thinking... \"why is he laughing, whats going on, what are we doing here!?\" for reasons i cant explain...i started laughing as well. after a few seconds i remember thinking that something really horrible just happend, and i shouldnt be laughing, laughing was the very last thing i should do. so i said \"wait!\" my friend looked and me and said \"what...?\" and whatever idea i had in my mind, of something bad happening, i remember i had something specific in mind, but as quickly as it came it was gone, and never came back. \"nothing\" i said. i dont have any more memory of that night. the next day, some more weird things happened. all i can remember was we were in our old barn, and i just started feeling very odd. just sort of \"out of body\" i suppose. i got this very strange urge to start climbing a ladder, so i did that. i got up a ways, and i looked down and my brother and my friend were staring up at me, with a look of horror on their face. i remember wondering whats wrong with them, why are they looking at me like that, i cant hurt them, heck they're bigger than me! and then i lost conciousness again. i remember having some extremely disturbing dreams, which i wont go into. when i woke up, i was alone and in the hay loft of the barn, i was jerking and convulsing violently. my last memory i was on the ground floor, climbing this ladder propped against the wall of the barn, now i was magically in the hay loft (i couldnt get there from the ladder, if thats what you were wondering. i would of had to climb down it, and go to the other side of the barn to reach the stairs leading up to the hayloft). my first instinct when i woke was \"run!\" and i jumped up and ran, i jumped 15 feet down to the floor of the barn, spraining my ankle but still sprinting as fast as i could. i started running to the house, screaming my brother's name and \"help!\". i stopped myself, and thought to myself \"wait....what am i running from? whats going on?\" and \"dont call your brother for help, he'll think you're a [cms\\tg\\pd]!\" strange but...thats what came to mind. i stood there and took a few big breaths and tried to calm myself down, then i wandered back into the house. my brother was there, playing nes in the living room, but my friend was missing. i asked my brother where my friend went. he sat there focusing on his game, not really interested in me, and said his parents came and got him, he implied i should of remembered that. i remarked that he was just here a minute ago, how could they have came and got him? he ignored me. i asked him where had i been when his parents came, he simply answered in a annoyed tone \"what!?\" as if it was the stupidest question he ever heard. i dropped the subject immediately. thats all i remember about that day. so....all this could just be weird right? maybe i had a bad virus, or i'm imagining things. but there's one thing that happened afterwords that make me believe something really did happen. during the summer, while we were harvesting corn, the military came out. all of a sudden there were humvees and deuce and a halfs driving all over the road. my parents were both in the military, so this didnt seem odd to them at all, but i remember wondering what the heck they were doing out in bristolville. there was a lot of them too, the deuces had full loads of soldiers in them everywhere they went, and they drove around like they were patrolling. my brother came home from riding his bike one day while they were out there, and he told me he knows where they're all camping out. guess where? yeah, they set up camp in the clearing in the woods down the street, where the old oil well is. where my \"helicopter\", \"crashed\". i can remember harvesting corn with my father, and seeing a bunch of signal flares being fired into the air, down near where the oil well was, right at dusk (seems dangerous retrospectively, there were many houses right in the area those flares could of fell onto). my father wondered out loud who could be firing those off, and i said sarcastically to him \"gee, i dunno, probably all those military guys camped out down there, huh, major?\". i was kind of annoyed that my air force officer dad was too dim to make that connection, he was upset for my backtalk for the rest of the day. strangely enough, while i made the connection in the back of my head that that's where my \"helicopter\" went down, i was much more concerned with simpler things like getting harvest over with. while my parents were both air force officers at the time, this was not a military community, these incidents were the first and last time i ever saw military personnel (besides my parent) out there. they came out again, the same time, the next year. before they came out, this time they put fliers in everyone's mailbox saying they were there for \"camping exercises\", even then i thought that was a very odd reason to come out here. if you were to personally see this oil well area, you'd laugh at the idea of it offering any sort camping experience. plus, they have vienna, ravenna, wright pat, many bases in ohio with miles of land for them to camp on. they came out and camped in a small clearing, next to a cornfield? with civilian houses all around them? i should note, that after the second time, they never came out again. i've never seen a single military vehicle out here since then. well...that was extremely suspicious, and thats really all i got on the subject. i'm writing you, just to report it for one i guess, but more i'm hoping maybe you've heard something along these lines that maybe you can add to. i've written a few reporters over time who investigated the sighting in brookfield after that, but none seemed all that interested in my story, aside from telling me that i should of saved one of the fliers the military handed out, only then would that interest them. so it's a huge question mark for me, and i've always been looking to try to fill in some holes. i just hope someone else out there saw something similar. i freely admit i have absolutely no clue what that flying object was. i dont even like to call it a \"ufo\", as i think you know that does imply something. i have no clue what it was, or what the weird events to follow were, or why the military came out. if i had to guess what it was, i'd say it was some sort of military experiment, but i dont know. curiously enough, a few weeks after this took place, i developed a very odd skin condition. i had huge, watery blisters, inches in diameter start forming all over my body. my parents were both medical officers, and we lived on a farm, so basically none of us kids ever went to the doctor, my parents always treated us. i remember they made me rip the blister skin off, and scrub the raw skin underneath with iodine solution. was a very painful experience, my father called it \"chinese torture\" but said it's what i had to do. this skin condition never occured again with me though. oh well, thats my story though. i've been looking around online, hoping to find someone more local to report this too, but i've been unable to. this is actually the first time i've ever told anyone the full story, i've told a few people about the sighting, but never about what took place afterwards. i asked my brother about it once, he has no memory of it. my friend, i lost contact with, he died recently though i believe, we never spoke about that night. if you have any questions or interests, feel free to
