Husband noticed strange object. Object appeared to move within a small space, almost a vibration. Like a kid shaking a flashlight. He then noticed 2 more similar objects nearby the first. They each had more than one light, and more than one color of light. He watched them for a very long time. They gradually moved across the sky in no real pattern. When he pointed the first object out to me. He said \"What the *^#*@ is that?\" I and a friend looked at it. It made me very uncomfortable and both I and my friend went inside the house while my husband continued to observe. He said that he never lost sight of the object. He needed to go to bed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18108.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18108.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/11/2009 10:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"18108","Latitude":"34.203997","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.203997,+-83.457106(18108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18108) map </A>"}
