(actually, just typing this out made me wish i hadn't ever thought of that night again.) it's a feeling that you've seen something you shouldn't have. i almost forgot, the lights reconfigured briefly into an almost-cigar shape before it just glided away. ironically, i've lived in the absolute middle-of-nowhere tx (er, near an air force base - so i've seen some funky, but clearly manmade things) for 16 years now and never once seen anything suspect (we have nothing but clear skies!) since that terrifying night. here's the \"oh, she's crazy, nevermind\" part - i had a feeling that it was incredibly dangerous to me personally. it was too big, too close, too quiet and (yeah) alien. and it was right over my house. but, no, not that crazy - no abduction story or anything, just a conviction that it wasn't manmade. and it didn't care if i saw it or not. and.. thanks for listening. i had no idea that the \"hudson valley boomerang\" existed before this odd google night tonight."],"Latitude":"41.578642","City":"Sherman","Date of the Event":"09/30/1987 12:00 UTC","Region":"Connecticut","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11302008-0006","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/30/1987 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14153.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14153.html"]}
