And as I always do look up at the sky looking to the west. And I see a star like object moving across the sky (north)in a straight line . At first I thought it was a satellite. But when it never showed up on the other side of the tree I knew something was up. I kept looking for it, and then saw the same type of object come out of no where going south opposite direction. it appeared to be lower in the sky. And then that object just vanished. I went out the next night at the same time and was looking to see if indeed it was a satellite and saw nothing."],"Region":"Colorado","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pagosa Springs","There were no other sightings in Pagosa Springs on or around September 30th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Longitude":"-107.008052","Summary":"Star like object moving across sky","Date Submitted":"10/06/2010 10:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.27884,+-107.008052(25703)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25703) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10062010-0004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.27884","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25703.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25703.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Case Number":"25703"}
