Live in the country friend said john what is that and point up. Clear night no noise at all no chickens dog or anything. Look up seen this big triangle shape moving slowly over my yard , me and my house. I have a big yard and it covered the whole thing. 2 acres. No sounds I could make out the out line as sort of triangle with maybe rounded front what I would call big wing. On small solid reddish light on the front , Used the oak trees as a gauge for size and for distance. It was below clouds but maybe 250 ft above trees. We watch it come over my house and as it reach the road it banked to the southeast As it move off what appeared to be a small chase plane appeared to the left side about a 1oo feet of it���s side. At this point the back of the object hat a row of white lights that sort of pulsed but in a left to right and not in a pattern. . This means to tail fin as normal aircraft have. It went about 8 to 10 miles and turn south. We both where unaware of any aircraft in our or other countries to match what we saw."],"City":"Adel","Latitude":"31.119741","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/20/2013 04:57 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Adel","There were no other sightings in Adel on or around November 19th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52339.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52339.html"],"Summary":"BIGGER THAN A C-5 AIRCRAFT, lOOK LIKE THE BIG WING BOMMBER BUT BIGGER","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11202013-0024","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-83.379541"}
