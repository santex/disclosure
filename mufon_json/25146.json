{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were swimming down at Nelson's Landing which is on Lake Mojave. We were floating around looking at the stars. My sister noticed 4 objects moving in the sky. As we watched, 2 objects appeared to fly away from earth and while the one of the other objects sped up to join the other object and they flew away on an easterly trajectory. I watch the stars often, but have never seen a satellite exhibit any erratic behavior like I seen last night, nor have I ever seen one match the speed these objects had. Unfortunately we were swimming and didn't have a camera handy."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/20/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"Henderson","Summary":"4 high flying objects appeared similar to how satelites in orbit, except speed was much too fast and non orbital motion was shown.","Latitude":"36.037645","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"08/21/2010 05:04 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25146.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25146.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.037645,+-115.076254(25146)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25146) map </A>","Case Number":"25146","Region":"Nevada","Log Number":"US-08212010-0001","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Henderson","There were no other sightings in Henderson on or around August 20th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-115.076254","Source":"MUFON"}
