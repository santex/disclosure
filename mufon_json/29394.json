Around the beginning of the movie we saw about 5-6 round lights appear to the right of the movie screen. They all seems to float together, staying about the same distance apart and went behind the movie screen, then to the left of it. They stopped and slowly faded to small lights, then nothing. You could hear other people saying things like \"what are those strange lights?\" from other cars. We tried to take a picture but it didn't come out. Other poeple were taking pictures. I checked on facebook and the newspapers the next day to see if anyone reported it, and apparently not. It seemed really close, not much higher up than the screen. I am so a believer now!"],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/04/2011 03:32 UTC","Summary":"We saw 5 to 6 round lights moving together.","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/22/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"41.39466","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.39466,+-82.010172(29394)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29394) map </A>","Case Number":"29394","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
