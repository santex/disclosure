She was taking a load to California. while traveling through vegas, whe and her son were shocked to see a UFO ahead of them, traveling above the freeway. the were going to pull over to get a better look, but they couldn't because too many others were pulled over taking pictures etc. She could not get her phone to take a picture of it. I was traveling slow enough they over took it, and got a good look of the under side. she was way excited, and called me to see if I had heard anything on the news about it. I checked every where. I called her back and it had changed directions and they had lost sight...but as we talked it came back into view. She said it was a saucer like the ones you see in movies, with lights circling it, that were white, and on the bottom there were two red blinking (I think) lights."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
