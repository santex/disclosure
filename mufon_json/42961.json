One night I has an argument with my girlfriend. I went outside to take a walk around 10 pm. As I was walking I looked to my left (North) and saw a floating light. I had seen them before so I just stared at it and it disappeared in thin air like it usually does. It was moving westward at a slow pace. I was excited to see it because I have seen them many times."],"City":"Compton","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10012012-0018","Latitude":"33.889288","Summary":"I saw a ball of light floating in the sky over a school","Date Submitted":"10/01/2012 10:16 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"42961"}
