Observed two star-like objects, at what appeared to be a great distance away (perhapse in orbit). They were traveling at a constant very fast speed from North to South in unison,as if they were sychronized. From my point of view the two objects stayed a hand width apart while following each other, then the first object continued it's quick pace South but the second blew my mind. It slowed down and grew with brightness in size 4 to 5 times it's original size. It seemed like it was pointing a light right at me for about 1-2 seconds. Long enough to wonder if it were coming my way. Then it's brightness shrank back to original size and the the second traveled East and upward into space till it became so small I lost sight. The first continued on past my sight from N to SSW. Neither object showed flashing lights. I suppose the first could have been some fast man-made jet, but the second was freaky. I'm in my 40's, live on a farm, seen jets, shooting stars, walk everynight, retired Deputy Sheriff...never seen anything like this."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Boonville","There were no other sightings in Boonville on or around June 23rd 2009"],"Region":"North Carolina","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.705001","Date Submitted":"06/23/2009 10:45 UTC","Summary":"Two star-like objects following each other at a great speed and elevation, traveling North to South.","Latitude":"36.240226","Case Number":"17637","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/23/2009 10:45 UTC"}
