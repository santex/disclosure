I was facing West in the direction of the Little League fields, the view of which is obstructed by homes and a church. The bright ballpark lights illuminated the underbelly of the craft enough so that I could make out it's shape. It seemed to have a stealth-like surface in that it was not shiney. It had a curvature of that of an upside-down frisby, so that the edges were not hard angled, but curved up slightly. There was nothing shiney, nor were there any lights from it. There was no sound heard from it. Had the park lights not been lit, I would not have seen it at all. Other times I've been there at night walking my dog, and I have noticed stars \"dissappearing and reappearing\", which I had concluded that perhaps it was caused by a flock of birds...now I am not so sure about that reasoning. It could be the disks flying overhead. A power plant would be in the direction of it's path only about two to three miles away. end of message."]}
