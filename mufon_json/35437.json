One on left side of chemtrail next to sun. Then a non orb pix, then the orb on other side of sun. Very dramitic pix! Looks like a moon. Except moon was far behind me. I also sent in orange orb pictures in januaray 2012. These are very clear and large, camera picked up the orbs. Which hurt your eyes because of sun facing you.
