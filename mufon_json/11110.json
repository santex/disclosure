First off I live in Lowell Massachusetts which is a small city of about 115,000 people. It was saturday night, June 7th, just two days ago from witing this. It was about 10:30 and I walked down the street to buy some cigarettes. When I had left the store it was about 10:40 to 10:45 and I looked up and saw a bright white light which at first I thought could be a star, but I knew it was'nt after a few seconds. I proceeded to look at it, it was about 4 or 5 times bigger and brighter than the north star. The light was kind of odd, not quite like starlight, and defiantly not like any aircraft light I had ever seen. I was staring at it for about 20 or 30 seconds as it was perfectly still, then it moved at a downward right angle, but dimmed at the same time it began this movement until it had dissapeared. From my vantage point, it moved about 10'' in the sky in about 3 seconds. Though I cannot say for sure it seemed like it was a good distance away. Now....To the second part of my story, My good friend AJ, that I have known most of my life and also lives in the same town, called me up the next day. Now mind you he is quite a skeptic. He called me up all excited asking me if I had heard anything about ufo's, or something along those lines, which I of course thought was strange with my sighting the previous night. He proceeded to tell me about his early evening shower he was taking at around 5 the same day of my sighting. He had his radio on in the shower listening to 106.3, he said all of the sudden the radio started switching back and fourth from 106.3 to 106.7 multiple times...And then he heard a transmission, what he said sounded like an airforce transmission. He heard something along the lines of ''myrtle to 17 over and out, object is in sight, proceed to intercept object, roger that''. This struck a real chord in me seeing that I had just saw something strange, and I had'nt even told him about it. Now I don't know if those transmissions were only going through radios in that particular area, or if that happened in the whole city or what, but It would be nice to know If those transmissions were recorded at by one of the radio stations or something. Whatever those pilots were intercepting, I would like to know. Also late sunday night my brother heard jet fighters flying over his apartment, or at least something military flying over. Strange weekend......"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11110","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/07/2008 10:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Lowell","There were no other sightings in Lowell on or around June 7th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.640045,+-71.310242(11110)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11110) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11110.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06092008-0012","Object Shape":"Circle"}
