several airplanes - it wasn't one of those; &, several satellites pass overhead and it definitely wasn't one of those. but the most interesting thing happened with the satellites. when one of the many that i saw passed nearest by the moving star i saw the object's motions settle down and come to a complete stop. then stranger still - the satellite passed over the star - making the star closer to the earth. very interesting. once the satellite had passed a safe distance away my little friend started to play again. at all times i felt very safe, with the exception of the first few moments of the sighting. having never seen an unidentifable object in the sky before i was somewhat nervous knowing that i was all alone for miles and miles. it was during that initial moments of having noticed the item that i saw it come very far down in the sky...in a direction towards me. foolishly i hadn't brought any with me to view it up close, but i could tell it was getting very low in the sky and and definitely in my direction. after a while though it retreated and thankfully my nerves calmed substantially. this viewing as i said continued on for hours. this is a purely a subjective impression (and a very anthropomorphized one at that) but i started to have this feeling like this 'star' had been dropped off at 'ufo daycare'. i know it sounds bizarre - but it seemed like this object was given a confined space to 'play' or try out its 'wings' waiting for the 'parents' to finish their earthly errands and come back. projecting wildly i know - but that's how it 'seemed'. it was a few hours into this encounter that i had the brainy idea to start looking around the sky to see if i could see anything else. disclaimer: this is where i even start to have a hard time believing... i noticed after looking around and staring carefully and intently that there were more of these objects in the sky...2,3,4,5. many. stranger still each one of them appeared to have their own 'character'. they were of different radii, moved in different styles at different speeds, all in a uniquely 'organic' way but each to their own design. what happened next was where i began to think that i must surely be hallucianting (luckly this story has strong witnesses shortly arriving) because i noticed that these 'stars' turned completely still every time i stopped looking at them. when i turned my attention back to the inidivual objects...each began to move again. it was almost like i 'inspired' them to move again which to me sent a chill down my spine because it meant - they knew i was there watching them. (see wild explanation in my conclusion below) again, i did my best to compare these moving objects against a reference of established stationary stars. for each object, i could put them in perspective of static celestial objects while they continued to move about. to say this was fascinating would be an understatement. i watched for hours, but then realizing that it was well past midnight i thought it might be time to start back to calgary. was a difficult decision to make on account of i did not know whether or not i would ever see such a things again (luckily i have not had to worry - but that's for another submission). i started to drive back north to calgary looking out my windshield every once in a while to see if the first object i had spotted was still there. sure enough every time i looked it was happily 'swimming' away in the north sky. i drove about an hour north to the town of longview, ab: http:\\\\www.mapquest.com\\maps\\longview+ab\\? - still there. i drove on to the town of black diamond: http:\\\\www.mapquest.com\\maps\\black+diamond+ab\\? - still there. i then decided to drive to the town of turner valley: http:\\\\www.mapquest.com\\maps\\turner+valley+ab\\? as i knew that they had a detachment of the royal canadian mounted police and i thought if i could get someone respectable to see it too, my hallucination would be absolved and my story would get some much needed credibility. unfortunately, it was closed and all the officers had gone home for the night - such is crime ridden canada. i continued to drive on back to calgary not being much more than an hour away. by this time it was easily 2am if not later - when a brain wave hit me. on my home was the local university's observatory - the rothney astrophysical observatory: http:\\\\www.ucalgary.ca\\rao\\ surely there must be some people charting the perseids - perhaps i could get them to corroborate my story! again being canada, the door was left wide open and i walked right in. i managed to find two astronomy grad students working at cataloguing the meteor show. i asked them if they could come have a look at 'something'. both came out and i pointed out the object. it took them a while to discern exactly what i was pointing at but eventually they both saw it. first question - is it moving? yes. second question - do you both see it? yes. third question - what the $^&# is it? this is where the story got interesting. it's probably a satellite they said - look again i said. what is it i asked again? it's probably the north star - look again i said. what is it i asked once more. it could be lidar (no not a napoleon dynamite reference but this: http:\\\\en.wikipedia.org\\wiki\\lidar). does anyone operate lidar in this province? no. then what...could...this possibly be. i finally got the answer i had been waiting for. i...don't...know. confirmation - i'm not crazy. the one grad student went back in but the other stayed very enraptured. he lamented that they had not bothered to bring out the infra red cameras they normally had as they didn't think they'd need them for a meteor show - so all we could do was look through binoculars where we saw the exact same thing only bigger. no additional resolution...just a star. i stayed for a while, my sanity restored, and eventually went home to get some rest. once i reached my house it was only an hour or two before the sun was due to rise. i decided to grab a quick smoke before turning in. my curiousity demanded i take one last look. sure enough my new 'friend' was still above busily swimming away. what happened next - completely unnerved me. here i was in calgary, canada a city of well over a million people when i saw it - in every direction i turned i could see little companion objects, swimming away in time to their own particular tunes. the numbers quickly became surprising and by the time i decided to go to bed and contemplate the impending invasion - i counted no less than 12 in the sky at once. amazing. the next day i told a very open minded friend of mine and he said he had spoken to someone in a nearby bedroom community of cochrane, ab: http:\\\\www.mapquest.com\\maps\\cochrane+ab\\? and they too had seen it. that's the story. conclusion (of an armchair variety): in the days that followed i thought very hard about my experience. i had little trouble accepting what i saw, with the exception of why there should be some interplay between me and these objects - that they should only come 'alive' when i looked at them. that part i had a very hard time accepting and explaining. that's the part that made me feel like i was completely nuts. not too long after i happened to re-watch the docu-movie 'what the bleep do we know' and something in their struck me. in discussing the topic of what truly is reality they spoke about one of the first experiences of native americans having seen the arriving europeans. to summarize the chief felt compelled to look out over the sea for a long period of time. he stared but saw nothing. i can't remember for sure but i think he even heard noises coming from the sea. he continued to look and eventually as if by magic the ship appeared from no where. my take on the situation was that his brain had absolutely no frame of reference, no experiential background, no basis of comparison with which to process this visual information and so his brain - unable to resolve the disconnect - 'decided' to fill in the blank and superimpose something he did know...the sea. this has become my theory for a very important reason. before this date (& being 36 years of age) i had never seen anything in the sky...in my entire life. but since then...i see these same objects...very often indeed. if you look at the reports, you will see that i will have soon filed two more (hopefully soon). and those are only the good ones. it seems very often now i can go outside and if i look around long enough and pay enough attention - at least one of the stars will start to move. my brain has accepted the image of what i have perceived allowing me to perceive it much more often. understand this is not projection. this is not some halo effect - wanting to see what i want to see. this is not some observer effect - it...just...happens. most recently the full lunar eclipse of last month held another instance. and stranger still it is often the same stars that come out to say 'hello' while the rest around them stay as fixed as...stars in the sky. this event was fully repeated next year. as soon as i can write this much again - have a look for ufos + meteors: part 2. even better was what happened this past winter during the leonids. again i will try and post that as well very soon as that was particular impressive. look for 'leonids' in the title. my total guess is that these showers provide some natural form of cover to these 'objects' and that is why they tend to be more profuse during these times. this happened over two years ago so i am doing my utmost to recollect. without question i have missed some things here and there and smoothed some others, but the kernal of this experience is rock solid. this is what happened. and to my best knowledge this phenomenon was nothing terrestrial that i have ever seen or have ever heard of of."],"Log Number":"CA-03182008-0002","Summary":"UFOs love Meteors (Pt 1)","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Alberta"}
