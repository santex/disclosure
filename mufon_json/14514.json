Smaller ones moving very irregularly, including disappearing/reappearing, and sudden, sharp, fast movements.","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","divs":["sighting details((my directions may be inaccurate, i'm using google maps and they don't have a compass for some.. really weird reason.)) i was on my way to lichtenberger park in elk grove for my evening exercise, traveling by bike like i do every day. i left my house around 5pm, and immediately noticed an unusually large number of planes in the sky. i didn't think too much of them, as many looked like commercial flights and cessna's with the exception of a much larger, gray plane. (every now and then, myself and others have encountered similar very large planes but at very low altitudes slowly going over our neighborhoods and parks during daylight hours. though these were strange sightings and presumably military in nature, we have not thought much about it although we do wonder where the base is and why they are traveling as low as a redwood's height over our suburb) as i reached the end of my neighborhood and approached main roads, i noticed a strange helicopter. it was big, dark, and had two blades on the top of it. it was heading nw, and i lost track of it in the houses. i continued east through kloss park, and it was becoming dusk. when i reached litchtenberger, heading south, i was noticing something huge in the sky, bigger than any other other craft i'd seen that day. i couldn't get a good look through the oak trees, but it had two lights on top of it, and was not shaped like a jet or plane. i rushed through the park until i got to the end of it, trying to get a better look, but i had lost it in the rooftops and trees. i then sat down on a swing, facing east, intently watching the sky for another sighting. it didn't take long before i saw the craft again. at first, its size made me think that the two lights belonged to separate craft, but they were most definitely part of the single ufo. it was heading east, southeast towards franklin high school, and moving pretty slow. i continued to keep my eyes on it, and rushed down the streets trying to keep up with it. it had a round underside, and the two lights seemed like they were mounted at the top of two points on the upperside of the craft, and could be compared to a ch-47d from what i've seen, but i doubt that is what i saw (though i didn't see the blades, i assume it had one over each light). the two lights were level, or very close to level with each other. the ufo appeared to be descending, as though it would land in the field on the corner of bruceville and elk grove blvd. unfortunately, i lost it behind the rite aid and nugget market so i quickly returned to the swing i had sat at. i was relieved to find that i could still watch it. my friend a called me then, and i told him what i was seeing. i ended the conversation quickly. i don't remember hearing any sounds. i was also beginning to notice the number of other planes in the sky when i saw something else. it was getting pretty dark by now. to my right were two white\\yellow lights, typical plane lights. but one of them disappeared as it moved down through a transparent cirrus cloud, it disappeared. the cloud did not seem thick enough to hide a plane's glow, as the night sky and even stars were visible through it. this light \"returned\" on the opposite side of the other light it had been with, only were it had been closer to and under it, it was now above and further apart from it. this light did nothing more, and continued heading north, northwest. i could barely make out a shape, but it looked like it was a jet. however, the light it was with begun acting strangely. it had been very slowly going up, slightly to the right while its partner had been gone before. now, it suddenly dropped down very, very, very quickly. it was almost as though it was teleporting, and i felt my heart sink because i thought i was witnessing a very weird crash, but in fast motion. then it continued heading north, northwest(i think it did other irregular things, but i can't recall with full certainty. may have also turned due west). i looked towards the larger ufo again to check on it, and it was still in my sights but had made substantial distance and appeared to be landing since it was still descending. my guess would have been somewhere near franklin high school, especially considering that the land out there becomes vacant fields and farmland. i returned home sometime around 6:12pm, to go with my family to my sister's band performance at the middle school, and i continued to see many aircraft, presumably cessna's, on the way there. when the performance ended at 8pm, air traffic seemed to be reduced to normal levels. (0-2 crafts) i am planning to return to the park and make a sketch of where i saw the lights of the ufo. i know this area very well, and marked which trees it was nearest to. i hope to have some sketches ready, but at the moment i don't have a scanner accessible."],"Latitude":"38.409979","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"10/27/2008 04:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Log Number":"US-12242008-0005","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Elk Grove","There were no other sightings in Elk Grove on or around October 27th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other,Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Sphere, Other","City":"Elk Grove","Longitude":"-121.362858","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Other"}
