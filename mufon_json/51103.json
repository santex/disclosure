{"Date of the Event":"09/19/2013 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI live on a lake. Couldn't sleep. Went out on balcony and saw flash of white light come from behind and over the house and across the lake and then hover and then went over the hill beyond the lake and descended behind the hill. When it hovered, I noticed two bands of white lights moving sequentially and a band of amber (copper) and green alternating light inbetween the two white bands that was pulsating. The colored lights were pulsating at a slower speed than the two bands of white light. On other occasions, my husband and I noticed an orange glow from behind the hill (there are no homes there). It was clearly not an airplane or helicopter."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.140271","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51103.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51103.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Thousand Oaks","There were no other sightings in Thousand Oaks on or around September 19th 2013"],"Longitude":"-118.857829","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"51103","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/26/2013 06:26 UTC","City":"Thousand Oaks","Log Number":"US-09262013-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.140271,+-118.857829(51103)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51103) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Summary":"2 rows of bright light hovering and go to south and descending behind hill","Region":"California"}
