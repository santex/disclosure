It was moving up the river towards Pittsburgh (north to south) at about the height of 400 feet. I watched it for about 5 minutes until it disappeared out of view. I think it either came out of the river or it just appeared out of nowhere."],"Date of the Event":"07/09/2010 11:55 UTC","Case Number":"24513","Summary":"Red pulsating sphere that appeared out of nowhere.","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-07142010-0016","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.442305","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24513.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24513.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.985996","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.442305,+-79.985996(24513)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24513) map </A>","City":"Pittsburgh","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
