{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"round circle of light came close then just blipped out","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn my back yard to sky watch. Cloudy night but an almost full moon lightened the sky between clouds. To the north I saw a bright round light. Drawing a path to my house. Came inside grabbed a jacket and my husband saying you've got to see this. When we got back outside it had risen in the sky but closer to our house. Flying underneath the cloud cover.Just a big round light, no sound , no blinking lights. Then it did a corkscrew manuver then just blinked out. It didn't go behind a cloud it just winked out. As for my reaction, my husband and I have seen alot of unusual things in the sky over the last 2 yrs. A ufo was reported in Delevan a few months ago, We saw a triangle afew months ago which I reported, so I was not really surprised. But any time I see one it is an awesome experience. Especially just blinking out. Just like someone just turned off the light."],"Date of the Event":"05/19/2008 09:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.314548,+-89.597983(10824)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10824) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around May 19th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","City":"San Jose","Date Submitted":"05/19/2008 09:10 UTC","Log Number":"US-05192008-0020","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.314548","Longitude":"-89.597983","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10824.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10824.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"10824"}
