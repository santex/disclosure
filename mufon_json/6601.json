This aircraft was headed east. Far above it were two objects. One was clearly a commercial aircraft, leaving contrails and I could clearly see the wings. A few thousand feet below that, not leaving any contrail, was another object, cylinderical in shape, with no visible wings. The lower object (from my point of view) paced the commercial aircraft. I watch both until the cylinderical object was no long visible and the commerical aircraft was just a point of light. Cylinderical object was the size of a cigarette butt held at arms lenght. Commercial aircraft was about half that size. It made no turns at all. I kept wishing it would do something goofy but it continued pacing the commercial aircraft until out of sight."],"Case Number":"6601","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.756472,+-83.970459(6601)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6601) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date of the Event":"03/22/2007 11:21 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
