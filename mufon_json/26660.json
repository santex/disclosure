{"Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe attached color JPEG shows an intriguing, round, energy-emitting object over Macy's Geary St. store at Union Square, in downtown San Francisco. I was doing a night-photography exercise with a Canon 5D on tripod, at 50 ISO. During the shoot, the sky over Macy's was very dark, and the object in question was not visible to the naked eye. Later on during post-production of the shot, I selected or isolated the dark sky over Macy's roof and applied to it a 12x exposure increase (or approximately three-and-a-half stops) in order to bring out colors and signals hidden in the shadows; at that exposure-increase point, the cyan, blue, dark-blue and violet colors seen showed up... at the same time with the object. Details of the mysterious element can be better appreciated on the second JPEG. Notice that it does not produce colors, only shades of gray. I refuse to conjecture on what this is, but I am certainly mystified and puzzled by it. ���Got any sensible theories as to the nature of this object?"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11192010-0005","Region":"California","Longitude":"-122.412276","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Other, Unknown","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There was one other sighting in San Francisco on or around November 12th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26660.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26660_submitter_file1___MG_0012_x2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26660_submitter_file2___MG_0012_x1-1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26660.html"],"Case Number":"26660","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"37.77635","Country":"United States","City":"San Francisco","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.77635,+-122.412276(26660)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26660) map </A>","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"UFO in San Francisco","Date Submitted":"11/19/2010 05:01 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/12/2010 06:37 UTC"}
