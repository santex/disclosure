{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was visiting my grandmothers house in Solon, Ohio. Solon is located 25 miles south-east of Cleveland, Ohio. The time was around 8 o'clock in the evening. And the sun was setting and I was sitting on the front porch. So I decided to look up at the sun set. And the house faces north. So I looked up at what I thought was an airplane. So I kept on looking at it and it was going unusualy slow. The craft was flying between 20,000 and 25,000 ft. It was a siverish color and I saw it for about 2-3 minutes. When I saw it I quickly went inside to tell my grandmother and I pointed to where it was and it was still in the same area. It was moving to the east. I have seen and I know many different types of aircraft from airliners like the 747 to the airbus 308 and jets like the SR-71 and the F-117 and the B-2 and Black aircraft like the Aurora and the X-32. And after about 2 minutes it was gone it just disappered. I felt really weird because I have never seen any thing like it."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Solon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6069.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6069.html"],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Weather Factors":"Light","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-81.441226","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Solon","There were no other sightings in Solon on or around May 22nd 2006"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/22/2006 08:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-01032007-0010","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"6069","Summary":"A silverish cigar shape heading east","Date of the Event":"05/22/2006 08:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.389776,+-81.441226(6069)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6069) map </A>","Latitude":"41.389776"}
