I noticed there was no sound, and the object appeared to travel a straight flight path and was flying low - 500 ft to 1000 ft, had 3-4 orange lights (connected) and not blinking. The shape was irregular - not a disc, not a triangle. The encounter lasted 2-3 minutes. My photo was taken on my iPhone - and we had a great ground to air visual moments before taking the photo. Lost sight as the object continued to fly north.....All of us had seen the same thing and none of us was sure what to make of it."],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-06302013-0017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.209392,+-77.189275(48527)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48527) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/29/2013 11:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/30/2013 01:43 UTC"}
