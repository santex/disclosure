About 2:45 am, I noticed two bright starlike flashes within 15 seconds of each other. My view of flashes were obstructed by a tree but it did get my attention. About one minute later I witnessed an unobstructed view of a stationary, white, starlike flash about 80 degrees up from my point. Flash was extremely bright, like a type of energy release. The flash of light almost instantaneously turned into a perfectly circular red object. It almost seem to have an outline to it. The object proceeded to move from the stationary spot and travel to the right and what seemed to be an ascension into the atmosphere at a very high speed. From Flash to out of view, the event was about 5 seconds. Very fluid and oddly beautiful."],"Case Number":"47801","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.19139,+-71.67583(47801)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47801) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06022013-0007","Region":"New Hampshire"}
