{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside to have a cigarette as I do not smoke insideI immediately noticed two star-like objects moving together, keeping the samespace between them as if they were connected. They seemed to be moving slowerthan an airplane, and the lights were not blinking. I first saw them just beyondthe radio towers next to our house. There are four towers, belonging to WKZOradio. I watched for a little more than a minute, walking out into the yard toget a better look away from the lights inside the house. I was hoping to see itthere was an unlit object between the lights, because it appeared there was, andI was looking ahead of the object to see if any stars lined up with the path itwas heading, to see if something might interfere with the light from the stars. It was then that the lights began to fade, as if going into a thin cloud bank. The sky was clear however. I watched for a few more minutes, but saw nothingelse."],"Region":"Michigan","Date Submitted":"12/02/2002 07:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2010.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2010.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Parchment","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"12/02/2002 07:10 UTC","City":"Parchment","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.328095","Summary":"Two star-like objects moving together","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.328095,+-85.56973(2010)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2010) map </A>","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.56973","Case Number":"2010","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
