{"Summary":"Orange Blimp","Log Number":"US-01192008-0009","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMY Husband and I were standing on our deck and we saw a flash of orange. I asked my husband if I was imaging it or not, he said NO i can see it too it was changing color from orange to red, then gold to a white light. It was moving around erractily. We continured to watch it for five minutes then it started to fade to a white star like shape. We live on the second floor of an apartment building. Near the kennebec river. I was feeling scared because this is not the frist time I saw one. and yet fascinated, I wish it had of been closer because I dont know the definate shape. The color was what made us frist notice it and that it was moving around strangely. It stayed stationary for a little bit like 2 min. then wiggle around.... up down left to and right.. then the light was fading in and out."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Augusta","There were no other sightings in Augusta on or around January 19th 2008"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.310624","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/19/2008 06:05 UTC","City":"Augusta","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9040","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-69.77949","Object Shape":"Blimp","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.310624,+-69.77949(9040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9040) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/19/2008 06:05 UTC","Region":"Maine","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9040.html"]}
