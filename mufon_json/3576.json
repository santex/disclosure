Noticed something moving up from the southeast, couldn't make out at first, then when it was directly above me, about 500 feet up, you could make a triangle shape. Relatively small about the size of a conventional aircraft. Made Zero noise. Move of to the North very slowly. When it was roughly 3 miles out it lit up very bright, and then vanished. The flash was bright enough to illumated the tree tops at my house."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-92.380959","Date Submitted":"09/30/2000 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Dark Triangle","Latitude":"36.342345","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3576.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3576.html"],"Weather Factors":"None"}
