Looked up in sky and in a period of less than 8 minutes or so, saw 6 objects omitting an orange-red star like light travel in the same path and disappear into the sky. They appeared sequentially, one, then two, then three. Went back in the house, came out a moment later and counted three more do the same thing, a little more spaced out this time. There was no noise emitted by these crafts or whatever they were. Live near an airport but these things were definitely not planes. They sort of floated across the sky in the same diagonal direction and did not take the path to the airport that planes would. I remember saying to myself, \"\"what in the *%^& are those things?!\" I ran to the front yard to see if any of my neighbors were outside but they were not. I spoke with one who pulled up in the cul de sac just after this event had occurred but he stated that he had just gotten out of his vehicle and had not seen anything."],"Latitude":"40.495545","Source":"MUFON"}
