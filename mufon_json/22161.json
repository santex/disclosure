Watched a bright light in the far off distant sky for a while, wondered if it was maybe a planet? Not! Then it started moving and slowly flew over my home. It saw me looking at it from several miles away. It wanted me to see it; it was so close I could have thrown a rock at it and hit it. The craft flew over me slowly, and totally silent. The craft was metallic, oval in shape, had reddish lights under neath. In my opinion it wansn't one of ours. Not from this earth. No way!
