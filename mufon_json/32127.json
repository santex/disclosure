(as my husband is trying to make light of the sighting with jokes for our daughters sake.) my mom an i then started discussing of the sighting of it possibly being a ufo as i ended the conversation with, \"now i need a nice tall glass of wine!\" we start laughing an began to go inside the house. until i look up again an seen another object on the same right side. i said,\"mom theirs another one!\" instead of going in the direction i went before. i went in the opposite direction up the road to get a better view with out the trees being in the way. it had the same swaying\\wobbly motion as it flown in the sky. same colors,shape,size etc as the last 2 i saw. though this one i was able to see what happened of how the other 2 had disappeared so quickly. after flying a good distance it stopped and hovered still in place for about maybe 4 minutes (my mother in law was able to take pictures at this time.) after the 4 minutes had past the orange color had then turned white, shrunk in size an dimmed out. just vanished ! me and my mom were just shocked like oh my heavens ! was very weird and creepy we felt. we stayed outside for a good 45 minutes talking about it after to see if we would be able to spot anymore. though we didn't after that. i definitely got my wine after! my husband was puzzled and said how he thought it was weird too. my mom then plugs her camera into the laptop and loads the pictures she took. these pictures look to be nothing like what we saw. the pictures shows a disc which created more confusion as to what it originally could had been. theyre not very good pictures but if you would to zoom in on them you can see the object better."],"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32127.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32127_submitter_file1__337783_252488031459143_100000938432914_697941_775909613_o.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32127_submitter_file2__337783_252488038125809_100000938432914_697942_1292664243_o.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32127.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
