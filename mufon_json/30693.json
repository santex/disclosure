{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on the sidewalk staring off into the stars, when suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw a red light appear out of nowhere. I took my eyes off of the stars and stared at the object that had caught my attention (this was during nighttime by the way). It was a huge, black hovering disc spinning with a dome atop of the spinning disc and had a big red light in the center of the disc with three smaller ones on each side of the big red light. It hovered for about 10 seconds or less and flew EXTREMELY quickly down from the sky and disappeared into nothingness."],"Latitude":"43.33498","Summary":"I was sitting on the sidewalk and I notice a red light, that I soon found to be a huge hovering black disc with red lights.","Log Number":"CA-08082011-0079","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30693.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30693.html"],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Burlington","There were no other sightings in Burlington on or around August 5th 2011"],"Longitude":"-79.790012","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome","Case Number":"30693","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:12","Country":"Canada","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/08/2011 01:49 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.33498,+-79.790012(30693)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30693) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Ontario","City":"Burlington","Date of the Event":"08/05/2011 10:30 UTC"}
