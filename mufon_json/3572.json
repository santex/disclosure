Last evening at approximately 10:00pm I went in my backyard (as usual) to have a smoke before bed. I always scan the night sky before retiring as it helps me to relax from my hectic activities. I first spotted what appeared to be a satellite travelling south by southeast at a pretty decent clip from over the city. I have observed satellites before and was not surprised to see one and figured I would just track it for as long as conditions allowed. After it passed overhead, I observed the light cut west 90 degrees followed by another 90 degree cut back south in rapid succession. Now, my first thought was: \"I don���t think satellites exactly have the capability to re route themselves like that.\" And then it happened - the craft stopped, hovered for maybe 15 - 20 seconds, and shot straight east at an incredible amount of speed. So fast, it left a quick streak before dissolving into nothing. The whole sighting lasted maybe 120 seconds."],"trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around July 11th 2005"],"Date of the Event":"07/11/2005 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07122005-0002","Date Submitted":"07/11/2005 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"34.057614","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.057614,+-118.238565(3572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3572) map </A>","Summary":"Craft travelling SE over Los Angeles, once overhead, two quick 90 degree turns, hovered, shot east at extraordinary speed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3572.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3572.html"],"City":"Los Angeles","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Source":"MUFON"}
