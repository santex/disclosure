I could see this object with my night goggles. I think this observation was not longer than 10-15 seconds I think, because it moved so fast. While moving, it also seemed to have a lightly instable flight path. It was a little bit oval and wasn't to see with barely eyes. It definately tried to stay unseen, it was camouflaged. One night before this occasion I saw it already! It was the same object, but it moved into the opposite direction."],"Country":"Germany","City":"Freiburg"}
