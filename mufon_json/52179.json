When I reached the parking lot I immediately turned to the left (South) and witnessed a very large glowing object streaking across the sky from South towards the Southwest. The object left a sizable trail and was the largest object I have ever seen streaking through the sky. It had some characteristics of the recent Russion meteor but the object I observed travelled slower and had a larger main body. It disappeared out of sight behind another building."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/11/2013 02:54 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Scottsdale","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.582613,+-111.873247(52179)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52179) map </A>","Summary":"Very large fireball like object streaking through sky","Region":"Arizona"}
