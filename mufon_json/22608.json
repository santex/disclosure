I observed a star-like object, roughtly 60 odd degrees (estimation)in the sky, moving in a Southeasterly direction. Steady speed and in a straight trajectory. a white light color. No contrail and definitly not meteorite. I tracked the object for about a minute and then it faded out to black. I assume that it was catching sunlight until it moved into the shadow of the Earth. It appeared to be at great altitude. Secondly, an object that catches sunlight at 10:30 pm in central Kentucky must be at extreme altitude. Do satelites move in a Southeasterly direction? Absolutely no aircraft marker lights. Speed was much faster that commercial aircraft. ISS is over central Africa. Anyone's thoughts would be welcome."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Longitude":"-84.866584","Date of the Event":"04/01/2010 10:35 UTC","Summary":"Moving star-like object","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Frankfort","Date Submitted":"04/01/2010 11:08 UTC"}
