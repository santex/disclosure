{"Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe family was outside when we noticed a bright orange light heading west in the sky. We watched it move slowly across the sky, stop, then change direction and head south. It moved extremely slow, like nothing we had ever seen in the sky before. The object sat in the sky for about 10 minutes, changing color from orange, to red, to white. After not moving for a period of time, it disappeared in the blink of an eye."],"Date Submitted":"05/06/2012 11:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37951.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/05/2012 07:40 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-105.18763","Log Number":"US-05062012-0009","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Morrison","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Morrison","There were no other sightings in Morrison on or around May 5th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.659409,+-105.18763(37951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37951) map </A>","Latitude":"39.659409","Case Number":"37951","Summary":"Orange object heading west, changed direction south, hovered 10 minutes"}
