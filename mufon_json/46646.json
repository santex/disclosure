We climbed almot till the top and start taking pictures. After a couple of weeks we were viewing the photo album and something caught our attention we zoom in and zoom out and we think that probably its a legal UFO. At that time in the top of the mountain we didnt hear any noise or even see anything weird, as I told we notice the UFO in only one pic of the hundreds we took in that family trip."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.282754,+-99.655722(46646)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46646) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"04/07/2013 12:57 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"19.282754","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"46646","Object Shape":"Disc","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
