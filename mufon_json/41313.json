I got the impression that it was sort of like an eye spying on people, because the way it closed up was like an eye closing and then it formed a thick black line that shrank in lenth untill it was gone. I've only told close family members about this, because my wife was afraid everyone would think I was crazy, but I don't care I want to know if anyone else has seen anything like this. I'll never forget."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07312012-0012","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"07/10/1997 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Kansas City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
