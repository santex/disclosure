It was flying rather low, it was going in one direction, in a single line, just like a plane would fly in one direction, but this definitely was not a plane, or anything that I could identify. The 3 other people I was with had never seen anything like that before either, it flew almost over us, just to the side at little. It flew in a straight line, it was glowing orange, almost like it was on fire, the object was only visible to us for 2 to 3 minutes, before it disappeared out of site, so it was moving a pretty steady speed. The object did not make any kind of sudden movements or go up or down in any way, it just stayed on a steady & straight path. This happened Nov.23, 2008 @ around 9:15PM in Valrico Florida near the intersection of Lumsden Ave and Mulrenna Ave., in a neighborhood very close to that intersection, and it was traveling toward the direction of Riverview when it disappeared or faded away from our vision, also, the object made no noise that we could hear. I would say that it looked like a glowing orange fireball meteorite, that was being controlled to move in a straight & steady path, and it did not operate like a regular meteorite at all, this object operated like it was being driven or controlled by something. I will included the pictures I took, but they do not show what I saw with the naked eye, the only camera I had was my cellphone camera, so my pictures did not turn out good, I will try to get copies of the other photos taken by the other person. Also, when we saw this object, there was no planes or helicopters anywhere near sight and then about 1 minute later after the sighting, there was a jet flying overhead way up high, heading to where the object had just been, so maybe this jet was dispatched to locate this object if calls were coming in before that (perhaps, or maybe it was just a regular pre-planned flight?(who knows), but the jet probably did not see the object because it was flying to where the UFO was, not where it went. All 4 of us were pretty stunned, and using words to describe it like strange, crazy, weird, unbelievable. Also, another strange thing about me, other than seeing a UFO is I have a raw piece of moldavite that has a lot of images in it, both with the naked eye and also in photos. One photo I must included in this UFO report is my photo of a typical looking grey alien in the moldavite, if anyone wants to see the rest of the moldavite pictures, let me know at email: leonardos-kryptonite@live.com and I will email them to you, I have a total of 18 photos of this piece of moldavite that shows images like, angels, fairies, demons, Nostradamus, a viking, 3 aliens, a wizard, Barrack Obama, plus more. And, I happened to have the crystal with me during this UFO sighting because I was going to show my friend the piece of moldavite and some photos I had printed out later on. For those who are not familiar with moldavite, it is a green glass thought to be formed after a meteorite hit the earth and splashed stuff up in the atmosphere and then the green glass rained back to earth in the Czech Republic (or something like that). Also, it is the stone of the holy grail and also the crystal of ���extraterrestrial connection���. Google moldavite for more info about this crystal if you want. So later after the UFO was long gone, my friend looked at the moldavite and moldavite photo of the alien and we joked about maybe it was the piece of moldavite that attracted them. I hardly ever take the moldavite out of my house, in fact, this was only the second time it has been out of my house since I've had it about 3 years now. I decided that if they come back and want the piece of moldavite from me, I will give it too them, no questions asked (or maybe swap it for a vacation to their planet if their friendly enough). It might just be \"their\" holy grail. (who knows)? Well, in summary, I feel very privileged to have finally seen my first UFO, I love watching pretty much all the paranormal programs on TV. Can't wait to see my first ghost now!"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/23/2008 09:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Latitude":"27.959985","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.959985,+-82.450588(13922)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13922) map </A>","Disposition":"Hoax","Longitude":"-82.450588","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11242008-0002","trends":["There have been 105 other sightings in Tampa","There were no other sightings in Tampa on or around November 23rd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"11/23/2008 09:15 UTC","Summary":"Orange glowing circle on top fire glowing on bottom","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"13922"}
