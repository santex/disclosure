{"Summary":"Three objects ,two white one red at high altitude . appeared to be controlled flight.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsAround mid afternoon I was sitting in my backyard with two other people when I noticed a cesna type aircraft overhead , While looking at the plane I noticed that at much higher elevation there were three round like objects which at first I thought were balloons ,One was red the other two were white and all were reflecting sunlight . The path of flight was heading south at first then the red one slowed down considerably and the two white ones continued on in close proximity to each other before one changed direction rather abruptly and accelerated west until I could no longer see it because of the sun ,while the other maintained its speed and continued southerly .I lost sight of the red one while it was still pretty much overhead . there were no clouds and the strangest thing was the direction change and acceleration . another witness commented they must be drones of some sort."],"Case Number":"47223","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47223.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47223.html"],"Latitude":"41.707791","Region":"Massachusetts","Longitude":"-71.150875","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Fall River","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05062013-0016","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/06/2013 06:24 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Fall River","There were no other sightings in Fall River on or around May 5th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"05/05/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.707791,+-71.150875(47223)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47223) map </A>"}
