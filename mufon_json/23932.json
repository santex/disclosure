There was no steady color. it was constantly changing. Looked like it was going to crash. It was shooting sparks (the sparks were changing colors also) and had what seemed to be a \"searchlight\" looking around it. It moved erratically before stopping and disappearing into the sky. It returned a couple minutes later only to disappear after another 15 or 20 seconds. Promptly after that, military aircrafts could be seen surveying the skys. They are still out there and its been over 2 hours."]}
