I was looking towards the San Fernando Valley from West LA and I thought it was a helicopter but was surprised to hear no sound even with the window closed, as it seemed rather close (bright). I opened the window to hear nothing and proceeded to watch the object appear to ascend while it moved across the sky towards the west. It burned out at about 50 degrees from my perspective off the horizon. Then I saw three more orbs over the next twenty minutes do a similar thing but all moving to and fizzling out at different locations in the sky. I woke my wife as a second witness. I have not seen nothing over the last hour and a half."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in West Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in West Los Angeles on or around July 15th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40819.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40819.html"],"Log Number":"US-07152012-0011","Date of the Event":"07/15/2012 01:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"over the couse of about 20 minutes, I saw (4) orange orbs that looked like fire balls moving across the sky and up until they burned out.","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"40819","Longitude":"-118.437016","Region":"California"}
