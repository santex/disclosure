{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailsagain i was outside facing southeast. saw a bright orange solid light traveling in a northwest direction. at first i thought it was just a plane, but when it was almost straight overhead the orange light suddenly went out and began flashing several randomly flashing blue white lights. at that same time it took an abrupt more north direction. my thoughts were it looked like glitter(the lights flashing), and i could see a solid black triangular shape from the lights flashing so randomly all over the under side of this object. i couldnt believe what i think im seeing here. but there was no sound at all. and i could see this object pretty well that it was pretty low. it continued in a north direction until it passed beyond the tree line. i also tried to record it on my cell phone, but my cell was way to dinky and weak. i felt incredibly in awe of what i just saw. ive been watching the sky in my area since.... i have my camcorder charged and ready."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42467.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42467.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/05/2012 10:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"42467","Latitude":"43.112677","Log Number":"US-09112012-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.112677,+-88.336176(42467)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42467) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-88.336176","City":"Hartland","Date Submitted":"09/11/2012 12:17 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hartland","There were no other sightings in Hartland on or around September 5th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"solid orange light traveling northwest. changed to a north direction. changed from orange light to randomly flashing lights","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
