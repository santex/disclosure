As i was looking to the left while we were passing Weber i noticed one of the lights along the highway looked a little strange. So i kept watching and saw red-orange circular object hovering then it moved along the path with the highway heading the opposite direction. It looked like it was trying to blend in with the colors of the lights on the highway but duller and not emitting light and was about the size of a large Frisbee. It was traveling slowly and stayed at the same height as it moved which was about 10- 20 ft above treeline and less than 60ft from the highway."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"35307","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35307.html"],"City":"Corpus Christi","Date Submitted":"01/28/2012 11:46 UTC","Latitude":"27.802213","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-01282012-0008","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.802213,+-97.394521(35307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35307) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"01/27/2012 06:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Summary":"I saw an orange circular object hovering along spid and weber as we were driving."}
