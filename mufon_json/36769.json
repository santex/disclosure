They were a very vivid red, and as we watched we could see them moving around a bit. Wondering what they were, we watched them for several minutes. While I'm assuming these lights represented objects, I never saw anything but the lights. Furthermore, there was little to no cloud cover so if these were objects it would be very difficult to say how far away they were. After we had watched them move in no discernible pattern for several minutes, we were shocked to see them start to pulsate a bit, one by one, then disappear. This was the end of the sighting. I had heard of people seeing things they could not explain in the sky before, but not until then had I seen anything myself."],"Log Number":"US-03262012-0024","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.420299,+-119.852992(36769)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36769) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
