After it was set up, I looked to see where if there any planets and I noticed a weird looking star. My eyesight is not that good even with my contacts in so I assumed my eyes were distorting it slightly. I did notice that everything else was really clear compared to most nights. Anyways, this star looked slightly wider at the sides and did appear to twinkle just a little too much. (By the way this star was not moving at all or did not appear to be moving.) I decided I would point my telescope at this star, but I had to move my telescope to the other side of my room. So I did that and looked again and it was still there. Then, I went to pick my lens up and slide it into place (took no more then 5 seconds). When I looked up again it was gone. There were no clouds and every other star looked just as clear. It was near trees but the direction of the earths orbit would naturally make it rise (in the east) so I figured it wasn���t just a star moving across the sky. This is the first UFO I have ever seen. There may be an explanation for it but I can���t explain it, so I am classifying it and an unidentified flying object."]}
