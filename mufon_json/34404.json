Almost daily this object can be seen from my front yard, it also comes at the same time every time. I decided to look at the object through a telescope. After viewing it from my telescope it was apparent to me and my family that it was no ordinary object. I feel this is a site that I have never experienced before. Every time I lose site of it, it descends below the tree line."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34404.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34404.html"],"Tags":"City"}
