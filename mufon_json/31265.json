It disappeared then moved north pulsated bright again faded out and I didnt see it again. I literally could not believe what I was seeing. I was jaw dropped. I spent 10 years in the military 6 of those as an aviation electrician ive never seen anything in the sky like that before. I am also in close proximity to dobbins afb I know aircraft. my phone was at the pool which is where i was walking to. by the time i realized what i was seeing I ran to get my phone to try and get a picture but was gone by then. I am definitely a tad disturbed by what i saw because i cannot find a logical explanation for what i saw. Jupiter is close to the same position but is not visible until much later in the evening. I KNOW WHAT I SAW, but i cannot find a logical reason."],"Date Submitted":"08/29/2011 12:39 UTC","City":"Atlanta","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Georgia","Longitude":"-84.441949","Latitude":"33.891437","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
