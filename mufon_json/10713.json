My wife noticed the object when it was almost overhead. She thought it was a childs balloon going over, then she wanted me to look because it looked strange. To me it looked much like a large weather balloon. It's altitude seemed very high because it had a blue haze like somthing you see in the distance. It moved from the north to the south in a straight pattern. It was not an airplane and moved too fast for a high altitude balloon. This was over a large urban area (suburban Kansas City). I noticed the time for future reference. I am 52 years old and grew up seeing weather balloons in Texas (from the govt. base in Palestine, TX) in the 60s and 70s this was not one. My wife who does not really believe in such things as UFOs seemed concerned over what it was. This was on a Saturday morning."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10713.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10713.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10713.html"],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Olathe","There were no other sightings in Olathe on or around May 3rd 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.888196,+-94.817028(10713)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10713) map </A>","Latitude":"38.888196","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Spherical shaped object at a high altitude moving quickly north to south.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"10713","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"None","City":"Olathe","Longitude":"-94.817028","Date of the Event":"05/03/2008 09:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05102008-0001","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
