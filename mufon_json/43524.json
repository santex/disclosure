{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at Stonehenge with a lot of other people for about 2 hours. It was peaceful even though crowds get me a little irritated. The sun was going in and out of the clouds all day. Right before I left I decided to take a picture with my phone to mark my location on the map. The following day as I looked closer I noticed this black oval object in the clouds. Could it be dirt? I took several pictures in a row and didn't notice any dirt or interference on those. To me it doesn't look like a plane or a helicopter as I only see an oval or circular object. The few people I showed said that it was a bird but it seems too far away to be that big. Who knows what it is. But what I do know is that it is not something normal in my life. And that is what has peaked my beliefs into thinking something more."],"Country":"United Kingdom","Latitude":"51.074095","Case Number":"43524","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"GB-10252012-0014","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Salisbury","There were no other sightings in Salisbury on or around September 26th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Date of the Event":"09/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"England","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.074095,+-1.788552(43524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43524) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/25/2012 10:26 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-1.788552","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43524_submitter_file1__StonehengeOctober262012.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43524.html"],"Summary":"I did not realize about the object in the picture until the next day when I closely examined the photo","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Salisbury"}
