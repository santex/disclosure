It caught my eye as it didn't wobble, or flutter... the movements were very precise. It slowly moved from the right (looking north) toward the tower on top of the building until the new years search lights shined on the object. When this happened it reversed direction without stopping and faded out of sight. It was like it just disappeared. It was larger then the birds and I would guess possibly 4ft orb. There were birds flying at a lower altitude which were obvious as birds due to their movement and motion. When the search light was within the vicinity of the object it did reflect the light however was not emitting its own source of light. I was on the southern side of the Yarra River with family waiting for the New Years Ever fireworks to start at Midnight.
