Thats when I noticed this object in the sky at first I thought it might have been a helicopter it was high off in the distance. But all of a sudden it was over us at a lower level thats when I realized it wasn't a plane or bird, it was a differnt object without sound. I yelled to my wife and mother look up WHAT IS THIS THING? It appeared to be a dark in color, flat and disc shape. We watched it travel over us it appeared at times to have traveled in different positions. (from flat to on edge). It had no sound or any noticable lighting. It was around 5:30 pm on Tuesday October 30th 2007. The weather was clear. It route of travel seemed to be from south to north.
