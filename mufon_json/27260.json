I had started seeing them nightly since last june. I moved to dunedin and now see them nightly but multiples. There is always 1 about 1000 ft in air over the water in front of house. There is also one south of my house and one east. All within half a mile. 1 sometimes flys around very low with a humming noise. When looking further in the air you can see hundreds.... they are not stars because you can make out the blue v shapes. Also, I don't know if they are extremely large ufo's, but also see extremely large triangles.... dots of blueish light at tips and very faint lines connecting them and the lines have flashes of light that go back and forth. They are plain to see.. I have a youtube page and somebody from the area messaged me saying they noticed it too. is my youtube. Its every night... you can see hundreds hovering on a clear night. I can email video.. I'm using my phone right now."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27260.html"],"Log Number":"US-01052011-0012","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.763988","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/05/2011 07:51 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Dunedin","There were no other sightings in Dunedin on or around"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"28.02257","Summary":"triangle ufo's blue lined with light on front and 3 blue beams","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","City":"Dunedin","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
