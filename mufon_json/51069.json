Saw a strobe flash twice (with maybe 10 second gap) then nothing. A little more NW of the strobe were flashing red, blue, green lights hovering, then moving slightly, then hovering again. Meanwhile something white streaked across the sky super fast towards the lights. Couldn't tell if it was a meteor or something related to it. Then looked towards the North and noticed a small white light way up, size of a star that would flash like a plane but then made 90 degree turn. Myself and 3 others were witness and just seemed very different. The red, green and blue lighted object slowly moved away towards the NW out of our sightline. This lasted about a half hour. Don't know what to make of all this but have never seen anything like this before."]}
