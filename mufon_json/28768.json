We spotted a disc shaped object about a half mile away approxamately. As we both looked in awe, out of the top rear of the object came two smaller objects. When we saw this we picked up our dogs and ran to the car. There were no lights or windows that we could see and there was no sound. It was grayish in color. I wish to this day we had stayed long enough to see what they would do but we were afraid they were watching us or coming after us with the smaller objects. I am 72 years old now and have tried to tell this story to other websites with no luck, we never heard from anyone."],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:30","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around October 7th 1976"],"City":"Arlington","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28768.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28768.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.074786,+-73.153973(28768)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28768) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/22/2011 09:43 UTC","Case Number":"28768","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-73.153973","Weather Factors":"None"}
