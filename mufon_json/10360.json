I saw two cigar shaped objects traveling toward me from an area known as Marble Hill; this is the site of a failed nuclear plant. The objects then turned south toward the Ohio River. At this point the objects were close enough that I could see that they did not have cockpits, they were just long and smooth. The objects were very shiny like mirrors and they did not make any noise. They flew over my Grandfathers field then as they flew over a wooded area they disappeared. I was used to seeing military aircraft as well as civilian planes, as there was a small airport and a military testing area just a few miles from my home. (Jefferson Proving Ground) I reported the incident to my family but they just wrote it off as a young boy���s imagination. MUFON may contact me via email."],"Log Number":"US-04152008-0018"}
