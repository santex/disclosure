Since I was sleeping and gazing the sky, I was able to notice this immediately; I first thought it might be a airplane, but later I realized it was an odd object, I was curious and fascinated to watch the object, but unfortunately I was able to watch this only for about 5-6 Secs due to physical obstacles around my residence."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38579.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38579.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"India","Case Number":"38579","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"78.265299","Summary":"Two orange colored objects were flying in sync with each other towards north-east","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
