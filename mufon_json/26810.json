As we got closer to the object, we realized that it wasn't moving and was a much larger \"manta ray\" shaped craft as opposed to any helicopter we've ever seen. After passing the object we saw ahead another craft, similar shape and lighting pattern, also hovering. We exited the next interstate exit and re-entered going back toward the objects to see if they were still there only to find both moving in a northerly direction. We eventually lost sight of both objects as they gained altitude and speed."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.772891,+-81.836234(26810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26810) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12012010-0008","Summary":"Two objects hovering approximately 200-300 feet above a major interstate.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
