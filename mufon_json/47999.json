At home for lunch break from work, 12:15 -12:45 PM. Leaving house at 12:45 PM when bright white object observed directly above house in stark contrast to light cloud coverage against deep blue sky. The white coloring against the darker blue sky is what initially caught my attention. Thinking it is a UFO since no planes or birds were noticed and it seemed to be hovering, I retrieved Nikon D3100 digital camera & began photographing object using AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm lens. Observed object initially stationary, hovering before it moved slowly a noticeable short distance east before abrupt stop, turn in place, then continued moving short distance west before another abrupt stop. Pink appendage noticed on top. Boomerang shape depending on angle it presented itself through lens. As it stopped & changed direction, top surface or bottom surface observed almost molar tooth-shaped with it \"wings\" noticeable more rounded in shape. The object did not make sound. I saw no condensation trails near the object. It was necessary to return to work, so the photography ended. At that time I lost sight of object. I was excited to see what I was observing. I searched the Internet later that evening to find any other pictures that resemble what I observed after viewing & enlarging images from camera. Finally, a picture of similar object was located on another UFO sighting website. That object, similarly photographed during the day was observed over Lake Elsinore, CA, not far south from Los Angeles on October 27, 2012. I am submitting 1 photo but have more."],"Date of the Event":"02/15/2013 12:45 UTC","Summary":"February 15, 2013: County of Los Angeles, CA. Day time sighting between 12:45 PM & 12:50 PM.
