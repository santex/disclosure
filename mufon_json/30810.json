As we talked, I noticed a large bright white object in the sky (that came out of nowhere) moving horizontally from left to right about a mile up in the northern sky. My friend could see I was distracted and I said, \"Oh my God! What is that?\" As the words were coming out of my mouth, the bright white oval object split into two bright ovals that both decended in different directions and then disappeared. By the time my friend turned around it was all over. I am an Air Force brat and still live near an air base so I am very accustomed to seeing air planes and jets in the night sky. This was no airplane or jet.
