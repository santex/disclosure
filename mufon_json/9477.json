whatever the object was, it was able to instaneously accelerate to absurd speeds and decelerate\\change course with no noticible necessity to obey newtonian laws concerning inertia. - it was luminescent, and a constant brightness. the outline (oval, as pharmaceutical-capsule-shaped) of the object was clear and sharp. - it made no discernible noise whatever (there was a housecat sitting on the bench with us, and it had no reaction whatever to the ufo). - it was following a civilian aircraft flight path (as a side note, where the flight path passed over there is today a county jail. this is how i calculated the approximate distance). - when my grandmother and i, ground-based observers, spotted it and reacted to its presence, it reacted as well (no way of knowing if there was a causal relationship there, could just be coincidence). - distance would have been probably about 2000 feet (less than a mile, but more than 1000 feet based on the size of the civilian aircraft we were previously observing). - the ufo was about the same size as a civilian, single-engined light aircraft. - my grandmother, the co-witness, has since passed on. thank you for giving us the venue to post this event for others to compare similarities. my perspective on the universe and our place in it has never been the same since this event."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/19/1976 12:00 UTC","Region":"Georgia","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet -
