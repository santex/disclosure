{"Summary":"I saw about five lights in a row that blinked out in quick succession from left to right.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25539.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25539.html"],"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from Walgreens at Ironwood Hill Dr. and Silverbell, heading west on Ironwood Hill near Greasewood Road. My receipt was marked 7:36 pm, so this happened about two minutes later. As I was driving along with my son in the back seat I saw a row of lights in the sky, slightly SW of me. I knew they were unusual because this is my road home, and I'm used to the lights on the Tucson mountains. As soon as I saw the lights they went out one by one from left to right. I got very excited and told my son what I'd seen and to keep an eye out for their return. They could have been flares. Who knows? They were whitish and brighter than stars. I arrived home about two minutes later and looked for the lights again from my back porch, but didn't see any more. I'd be interested to hear what Davis-Monthan Air Base says about them."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:02","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","Date of the Event":"09/23/2010 07:38 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-09242010-0005","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/24/2010 01:08 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.228133,+-110.923909(25539)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25539) map </A>","Longitude":"-110.923909","Case Number":"25539","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were 2 other sightings in Tucson on or around September 23rd 2010"],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Region":"Arizona","City":"Tucson","Latitude":"32.228133","Disposition":"Unknown"}
