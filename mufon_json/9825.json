The object wasn't visible when I shot the photo but appeared after it was downloaded. There also may be another one that I just noticed, not sure though. It's a spec at about the 10 o'clock position above the three masted schooner. I've attached 2 photos. The one I took and I've cropped the other one to show the detail. I'm not sure of the exact time but it was around sunset. I also have another pic where the same thing happened but this was in Maine. I'll send it separately."],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Light"}
