About 1 minute after awaking to my dog, my bed (only thing that I noticed) was shaking -- quite a bit. I know this sounds crazy! I thought we were having an earthquake. It must have just been my bed shaking. The walls are not cracked. Once the shaking and rumbling stopped I noticed outside... My blinds were lifted so I could see outside as I was laying on my side -- I saw a circle with lights, swirling (it was so fast) the outside was glowing like it was on fire (was disc shaped appeared flat). I thought it was something that was going to crash. This object was not far off the ground; I want to say about 10-15 feet. I called the police. My 911 call did not register (on phone calls made) and there was static on the line for a brief period. I had asked the dispatch officer if they could hear me -- they said yes, so I thought it was on my end. I just noticed on my cell phone when checking to see exact time I called the police and noticed the call back from the officer was registered on my phone (not the 911 call)."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.154396,+-83.67449(33891)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33891) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Milan","Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Milan","There were no other sightings in Milan on or around December 8th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.154396","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/08/2011 04:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/08/2011 08:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12082011-0008","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
