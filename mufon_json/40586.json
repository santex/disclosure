The lights were still and hovering just above the pine trees, no noise. They started to pulse bright red lights but then dimmed to a pinkish color. It traveled a short distance hovering and moving in a irregular pattern. It seem to move down behind the pines and then it vanished in the air. We tried to drive around the backside of the pine trees to a field where we know we would be able to see the sky clearly in many directions, but it was gone. If this were a plane or helicopter, we would have still been able to see it from any direction, North, South, East, West and up into the sky. We both agreed that we had witnessed a UFO. Wished we had a camera."],"Log Number":"US-07082012-0007","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Garner","There were no other sightings in Garner on or around July 8th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"07/08/2012 09:16 UTC"}
