I saw Jupiter tonight but not sure what I saw in the southwest sky. My wife and I were outside with the dogs and just when I was walking in the door I said to my wife \"look at that!!!\" It was big and bright in the southwest sky. Like a small moon with same intensity as ours. I ran to get my spotting scope and still could not make it out due to distance. It seemed to be moving very slowly southwest. I live in Glenwood Alberta Canada and watched this thing for about five minutes until the clouds over the mountains above Waterton Nation park started to block my view. It would sure be apreciated if you know of anything it may have been. We are pretty excited. Niether of us have ever seen anything like that before over the mountains."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-113.516425","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"33855","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"12/06/2011 06:10 UTC","Log Number":"CA-12062011-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.36538,+-113.516425(33855)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33855) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Bright like a big fire in sky at a distance","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33855.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33855.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/06/2011 08:37 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Glenwood","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Glenwood"}
