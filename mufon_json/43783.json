{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details I had started to leave my house when went out the frount door, and I saw lights comming up the valley where we live as thye craft got closer i could see lights on the side of the craft Ithought this is odd because airplanes have ligts on the front and on the wing tips unlike this craft, witch had them on the side of the main body. at frist i thought it was somesort of hover craft thyen i saw a red glowing orb escourting it or this vehichle was escourting the orb i don't know which i know the larger craft was very heavey because of the percussion of the props. If this is not some secret transport why would they not doit in the day. It appears they where following i59 north."],"Region":"Georgia","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cross","Case Number":"43783","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43783.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43783.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/08/2012 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-11082012-0016","Latitude":"31.042172","Summary":"i know it was notlike any airplane or crtaft i had seen before.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-83.068278","City":"Lakeland","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.042172,+-83.068278(43783)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43783) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/08/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lakeland","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."]}
