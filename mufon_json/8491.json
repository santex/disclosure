I was t my friends camp up on oneida lake. We were having a small bonfire roasting marshmallows, the usual. We were right on the shore of the lake and it was kind of cloudy like a storm was about to blow in but over the water was clear. We were looking up at the stars and then out of the clouds came a very large disc shaped object with a lot of flsking lights...it wasn't a plane, it made no noise and just hovered. The lights were many different colors, not just red and green and thats how we also knew it wasn't a plane. It literally just hovered there for about 5 minutes at the absolute most and then it was gone. I got a chill down the back of my neck. I knew it was a UFO. You just get a feeling."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8491.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8491.html"],"Case Number":"8491","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Log Number":"US-11272007-0011"}
