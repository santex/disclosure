I called Ohlone College PD since it came from behind there. According to Officer nothing happening up there. They said call Fremont PD. I call them and was transferred to East bay parks PD. According to East bay park pd they are getting reports all the way down to Garrin park in Hayward Calif. They went to investigate Hayward and told me to wait for East bay park PD to show up to witness what I saw. According to PD they claim its heat lightening. I have witnessed heat lightening in my life in albuquerque NM, and this is not even close to being heat lightening. Personally I think its a coverup story. Then again I could be wrong. I really do not know what is going on. The entire mountain is lighting up but no lighting up anywhere else in the skies. Only in the mountains all the way down to Hayward from Fremont."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41087.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41087.html"],"Object Shape":"Flash","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.553688","Date of the Event":"07/23/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Fremont","There were no other sightings in Fremont on or around July 23rd 2012"],"City":"Fremont","Summary":"White flash of light no object seen"}
