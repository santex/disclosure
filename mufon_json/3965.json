Sitting on lounge chair talking with wife at night sipping green tea. And looking at sky at night. 2. I saw this dark shape flying silent in this unusual boomerang shape, not recognizable as an aircraft. 3. A UFO, then double checked thinking it could be an owl.Except no flapping of wings and owls don't have lights on wings. 4. It had a sharp wedge shape like a flying wing it was flying over and was silent. It had lights on underneath but they were not sharp lights possibly 4 or 5 lights on each wing, it flew over for a few seconds and was gone. 5. Excited to have a high probablity of finally seeing a ufo 6.
