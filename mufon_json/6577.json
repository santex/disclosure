these things started to zig zag and i swear followed us from one side of the property to the other. they were pretty high up in the sky though, maybe 10,000 feet. but they were there and i am pretty sure somehow they new we were there to. so these two red and green cirlular shaped lights keep zigzagging through the corner of the sky, we are excited and yet panicked , but what happened next and what would follow would make anyone cry...(i did) one of my best friends (there was three of us) stood at the top of his drive way overlooking the ice on his lake as my other buddy and i were still looking in the sky, we kept telling my other friend, look , look...look in the sky yo, but he was like frozen still like he saw a ghost. he pointed at the ice and said\"shhhhh\" and right then and there i shit myself i swear and i think my other friend did as well. we saw a tall object, persone, or whatever it was walking across the ice (very tall and lenghty)with long arms swaying. it was like watching a movie..this is no bullshit. we started to hear noises from the other side of the shore of the lake again and heard what i can only describe as cosmic sounds coming from the sky and woods. we lost sight of whatever it was walking on the ice (this was in february) so we looked back into the sky and it seemed as though the red and green lights that were were watching just a few minutes ago were moving away and out of our sight. we new we had to follow them, this was to good, and thrilling to miss even though i was mad freaked out. my dumb friend did not want to bring a camera because he would have to wake his father up, so we had no camera witch i regret so so much now. we get in his jeep and try to follow the lights in the direction they went. they went towards harmony (a small town in rhode island just a little ways away from johnston rhode island where the sighting started at my friends house. we eventually lost track ofthese light and someone in the car (one of us three said turn on the radio) we turn on the radio and the fm stations are not coming in clear at all!! they are mostly static. we heard that am stations come in better at night than during the day (dont know if thats true or not) so we tell my friend that was driving to put an am station on. as soon as he did my eyes started to tear, i felt so stupid but if you heard what we heard at the age that we were you would prob start tearing too. we heard all these different noises, bops, pings, water dripping quick kind of noises with loud commanding noises in the back ground of it( that i sthe best way i can describe it, sorry) it was so freaky. we were like, ok, we need to get to a huge clear area without light and trees to intrupt our view of the sky we have to find these things. we all looked at each other and said, the golf course (i will not name the golf course) but it is in the harmony area. we drove to the course and started to drive up the winding dirt road wich lead to th eparking lot, this was a nice wide open area. as soon as we took the bend we saw something our eyes had never seen before. there were at least 6 very large very bright star\\cross shaped lights in the sky overhead just floating around like ducks in a pond. i started to panic, i was probly the most paniced, i was so frightened that i cryed, the other guys say they didnt but i am sure they did, i dont even think it was that i was scared but more excited and overwhelmed than anything. i called my mother and told her what i was witnessing she coulsnt believe it she to once had an experience (we both did prior to this one) she said get out of their before something happens. i had to call her and let her know because we did not have a camera. the driver of the jeep (my friend) flashed his head lights at these 6 or so bright bright lights in the sky an dthey flashed back just as many times as he flashed his lights, i i could not f*^king believe this. i actually got out of trhe car and starte dto shake a flash light around to see if they would communicate again to us. then the flash light got dim (the batterys were not good ) and i got back into the car. the formed a square, then a circle and then they were gone, they drifted away out of our sight. (they were about 2,000 feet in the air but looked like the size of a pretty big hous (starshaped\\ cross shaped) they no longer were green\\red cirlces as we had previously seen. they were about 2,000 yards away but seemed so big and so bright. when they left the radio started working again. i had to have my mother meet me at my front door when i returned home. i was so scared. i think this is why we have kept this quiet for so long. only the three of us know what we saw that night, until now and how crazy all the events were. we have seen some pretty creepy things in the sky since then. if anyone saw this, please let me know. are there any hot spots in rhode island wher e i might be able to see more of what i saw. sorry for the long story, but its true."],"Region":"Rhode Island","Latitude":"41.887877","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03192007-0002","Disposition":"Hoax","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Glocester","There were no other sightings in Glocester on or around February 17th 2004"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"6577","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-71.596731","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.887877,+-71.596731(6577)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6577) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/17/2004 01:30 UTC"}
