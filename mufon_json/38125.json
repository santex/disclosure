No sound or shape what so ever, just the strobing light. got to about the Hartford area in 5 seconds and took an abrupt right turn towards the South and it was out of range in less than 8 seconds total. It was not the flashing towers in Plainville and it wasn't a plane. Im planning on making a full report tomorrow."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38125.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38125.html"],"Latitude":"41.678245","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Bristol","There was one other sighting in Bristol on or around May 13th 2012"],"City":"Bristol","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"Connecticut","Log Number":"US-05132012-0020","Date Submitted":"05/13/2012 10:27 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/13/2012 10:01 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"38125","Summary":"Strobing lights flew at very high speed across Bristol and took a right turn towards the south","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
