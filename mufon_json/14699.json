I was brushing my teeth when out of the window, I saw a ufo. It was nothing like i had ever seen. It was like an oval with the ends coming into a point. I can't quite remeber the date, but the date above is my best guess. I saw a lare conical place like someone if they wantied to poke up the head, they would have enoght room. It had green lights, and it was making a chriiinnng noise softly. I ran aaqy from the window. I have not see the thing since."]}
