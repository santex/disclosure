(it is now unclear as to the order of experiences, and we both also feel as if we may have forgotten a few things as well.) as an afirmation to my thoughts that first of all, these lights were the lumerians, and second of all, they were now acknowledging that i am now moving in the right direction in my life and on my spiritual path, the lights moved into a perfectly straight line. sometimes, the bottom light in particular would get extremely bright, and surge with energy, in relations to our thoughts and what we were saying. one example of this occurance, which stands out, is when i said that i would tell diane they (lumerians) say hello. the bottom right light got extremely bright again, and then briefly went dim, when i thought about how brian was going to climb mt shasta the following weekend, and i wondered if brian would have any experiences with the lumerians. the same light also did this upon my recieving the message that they egerly await more conscious, closer interactions and engadgements, as we do. there were more then a dozen simmilar correlations with our thoughts and things we said. we were guided to hold out our hands at one point, and we could actually feel them holding our hands. an airplane flew above, and the lights on the mountain at that point were forming the exact same triangle as the lights on the plane. another plane flew above us later, and for about 90%? of the times that the planes light blinked, a frog would ribbit. this went on for a good period of time as the plane flew over the lake, and kristin and i found this to be quite amuzing. at one point the lights were pointing in a particular direction in the sky. when kristin looked in that direction she saw the exact same formation of lights that were on the mountain. the bottom right star faded away. then she looked back at the mountain and noticed that the bottom right light had also appeared to be \"gone\". she then looked back up at the stars, and noticed that the \"missing star\" was now there, and she then looked at the mountain where the missing light had also retured. during this whole experience , the bottom right light stayed to the right of the upper middle light. i visualised the bottom light crossing over to the left side of the upper light, and thought that this would signify crossing over into the assension of humanity, and earth, from our current reality, into the reality of love. shortly after this visualization, the bottom right light actually did cross over to the other side of the upper light. this seemed to be another afirmation. this whole experience must have been for more then an hour and a half..... but it was all so timeless.... we really were within another reality\\state of being. the main message i recieved was that we can be in that state of being whenever we want, and that the lumerians (and others) are always holding our hands along the way of our paths, but that we are the ones who have to do the work,take action,make the right decisions, and just simply exist within the vibration of love."],"Log Number":"US-07152005-0004","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Summary":"Lights on Mt Hood","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3593.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3593.html"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Government Camp","There were no other sightings in Government Camp on or around June 29th 2005"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/29/2005 11:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date of the Event":"06/29/2005 11:30 UTC","City":"Government Camp","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less"}
