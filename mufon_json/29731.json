They were not blinking like planes, in fact we saw a plane in the sky at the same time. The orange fireballs were very bright and moving west to east across the sky and over a mountain. We called my 17 yr.. old son outside and he witnessed them to. After about a minute one disappeared then shortly after that the other one did. We did not see them again."],"Longitude":"-77.792499","Case Number":"29731","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.775618,+-77.792499(29731)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29731) map </A>"}
