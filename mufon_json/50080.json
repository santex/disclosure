The sky was for the most part, clear. Overhead there were some very interesting thin cloud formations, and as I looked up, off to the east, I noticed an extremely brilliant, what appeared to be, star, but what also caught my eye was the less brilliant star slightly off to the right and down a few degrees, traveling at the same speed as the brilliant star. I quickly said to my friend Kay, \" Kay, quick, look, and pointed to the direction of the ( stars ). She saw them, and then as we were watching them continue towards where we eventually would not be able to see them, the less brilliant (star) peeled off into a south east direction and out of sight. At that time having both of them in sight as that was happening, I saw to puffs of white smoke apparently coming from the brilliant star, and staying in the sky where they were created, as the brilliant star continued on it's course. Those two puffs of smoke stayed there for quite some time. As re-played this viewing in my mind, it just didn't add up. All of what we saw, appeared to be in space, not in our atmosphere. The movement of the these two (stars) was that of a satellite, which I have seen at night."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50080.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50080.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.658725","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/16/2013 07:00 UTC","City":"Toledo","Summary":"Appeared to be two stars, one brillant, moving like satellites, The less brilliant pleeling off, while the other stayed it's course.","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Longitude":"-83.558141","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08232013-0008","Date Submitted":"08/23/2013 10:33 UTC","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Toledo","There was one other sighting in Toledo on or around August 16th 2013"],"Case Number":"50080"}
