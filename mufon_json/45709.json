At first i thought they where just lights from a plan since there is a airport not far from our home. As we watched more there where 4 different sets of lights. We noticed that 2 where flying north and 2 where flying south at a close range to each other. Out of now where one of the objects starting getting brighter then went from one light to 5 red bright lights then back to 1. We watched them make sharp turns then head south. after a few minutes they came back but heading north."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Georgia","City":"Hephzibah","Date Submitted":"02/15/2013 01:34 UTC","Summary":"Lights in the sky in georgia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45709.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45709.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"45709","Date of the Event":"02/15/2013 12:00 UTC"}
