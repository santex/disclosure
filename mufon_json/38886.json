We observed 2 orange orbs side by side. Within seconds there were 3 in the shape of a triangle. My husband ran into the house to get the video camera. The orbs changed from 2 to 3. Then another one appeared to the right of the original 3, and the first 3 disappeared. From the 2nd orb, 3 more appeared and he continued to film. The video basically shows it all. The actual even lasted around 15 minutes, even though the video footage runs for just over 9 minutes. We did miss some of the first few minutes, and also edited out the focusing of the ojects. These objects appeared above the horizon in an easterly direction over Apple Valley, CA."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38886.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38886.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.477705"}
