Than, all of sudden, an object caught my sight. This object was a large dark outlined triangular shaped object that had 5 white lights that were located at the edge of the this object. This lights made a V-shape. This object was flying slightly above the clouds. I noticed it's triangular shape when it wasn't in cloud cover and noticed it's dark outline. The way the object flew was in a straight line, slightly faster than commercial airplanes. The object, as it flew straight, rotated from when I first sighted it till I lost its sight of about 20 - 30 degrees. I lost sight of the object after it went behind the tree line. At first, after viewing the object, I felt confused because I thought it was a plane but the object didn't make a sound as well as the way it didn't make a flight path the same as an airplane."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.742997,+-97.105026(51835)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51835) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Arlington","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"10/25/2013 08:31 UTC","Log Number":"US-10262013-0002","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around October 25th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"10/26/2013 12:38 UTC","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-97.105026"}
