{"Summary":"Appeared to be by the old millitary base outside of Lakeside,MT","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Kalispell","Case Number":"52380","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at my home in Kalispell, MTand I was going to the store when I noticed a very bright light light in the sky. I continued to watch the light thinking it may be a plane coming in to the Kalispell International Airport.As I observed the light for about 20 minutes I watched a plane coming in from the east headed towards the airport and the light did not move. I then saw another smaller aircraft fly by the light and the light did not move.I continued to watch the light for about an hour and I came in to get warm. I had told my brother about the light and I went back out to see if it was still there and the light had disappeared. We often have a number of sightings over the old military Airforce base outside of Lakeside,Montana. I believe this to be another ufo in this area."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Montana","Longitude":"-114.226716","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Kalispell","There were no other sightings in Kalispell on or around November 22nd 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11222013-0014","Country":"United States","Latitude":"48.21042","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.21042,+-114.226716(52380)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52380) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52380.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52380.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/22/2013 06:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/22/2013 10:50 UTC"}
