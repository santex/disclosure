Many airplanes are known to fly in the area, but something told me that it was more than an airplane. We all were looking at the sky, when I noticed it and said,\"Hey, an airplane!\". Then I noticed that it was just blinking and then slowly started to go on a straight path away from the airport location, but it was picking up speed. Since I believed it was merely an airplane at first, I just concentrated on the fireworks, and not the object. After the fireworks were over, I looked to see if I could still see it, but it was long gone after a 25 minute firework display. After the sighting, I felt a little bit scared and was and psyched myself out about it. Now, I am pretty confident it is an UFO, but still not quite sure."],"Date of the Event":"07/06/2013 09:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Virginia","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Virginia Beach","There were no other sightings in Virginia Beach on or around July 6th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48814.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48814.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
