My dad as looking up in the sky and sa a bright light, then noticed it was moving. I first thought it was a star. The object followed the vehicle, turned when we turned,sped up with us, when lost in the woods it held back a little but caught up with us when we were visible again. Then when my dad and I exited the vehicle, it hovered for several minutes while we went into the store, and was still there when we got out of the store. My dad and I were both freaked out that something would be following us and speeding up so quickly alongside it. We knew it had to be a UFO. I lost track of it when I entered another house."],"Summary":"Bright light resembling a star, but bigger and brighter","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Pittston","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.193306,+-69.707355(52039)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52039) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/04/2013 06:46 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/04/2013 05:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pittston","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"52039"}
