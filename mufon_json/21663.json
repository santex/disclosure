I, at first, thought they went behind a hill or peak. I looked to check if there were any and there were not. Then I noticed a red light come out of them. Cannot recall if there were more than one light. That red light seemed to fade away as it came out of the brighter one. That went on a couple times and then the brighter one seemed to hover down the road and get brighter then disappeared. No sound was heard either. I wish I got the camera out. I was kind of taken back by this, but this was the highlight of checking out Area 51 for the first time. All under clear dark skies and, being an amateur astronomer, I have seen meteors and sateliites go across the sky but nothing like this!!"],"Region":"Nevada","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01262010-0016","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball, Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Rachel","Case Number":"21663","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21663.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21663.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.651062,+-115.736075(21663)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21663) map </A>"}
