{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis thing looked just like the moon,only with no gray,just white.There was no noise,no other colors,and perhaps as little as 20 yards in width.It moved very quickly,when it chose to,and slowly,at other times.I had a strong impression that it wanted me to come outside,which scared me.I did not go outside.At one point,it got as close as it seemed possible to the glass of our sliding doors as it could,the light of it was creepy,as it completely flooded the living room.I was very afraid.My 8 year old daughter was crying,she thought it was trying to get in,I just thought it wanted me or us to go out.It was out there for a very long time,well over an hour.moving up,down,back,forward.All silent,but seemingly,with a consience .My three other children were in their beds,and I finally began to get angry at the thing,the intrusion,the possible threat,though,I really did not sense a threat,but was unsure of any intent.eventually,I chose to ignore it.I closed the blinds.I thought the thing was playing with me. I have only told one other person about that night,a close neighbor.He nor his family had seen it,My daughter remembers it,but chooses not to speak of it,other than between us two.My husband,who worked nights,at the time,saw nothing on his way home that night,so I assume it left,at least by 2 AM. This happened 20 years ago.I was very much awake,Waiting for my daughter to become sleepy,so as to put her to bed also,so I could clean up and go to sleep myself.I have never seen anything like that from that time.I have never used drugs,been accused of having an over active mind,or any other delusion. I will always believe,now,in other unknown life."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13132.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13132.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-10212008-0004","Region":"Maine","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.891935,+-69.143186(13132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13132) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"44.891935","Date Submitted":"04/13/1998 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"04/13/1998 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Stetson","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Case Number":"13132","Summary":"the \" moon \" was hanging around outside my deck","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-69.143186","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Stetson","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO"}
