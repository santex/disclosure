He saw a small light that looked like a satellite. He said it was a little red to it. It was about 1000k in the exosphere, straight up above his head. At first he thought it was a satellite, then saw it change direction and taken off at a fast rate in a second. And disappeared out of sight. This report is what my husband told me. I am reporting this for him. The above is what he told me. Hes just not educated like me in the UFO information. Thank you for all your hard work.
