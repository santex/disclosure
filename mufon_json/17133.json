{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I had just finished washing the family van when my wife commented on two jets flying the opposite ways from each other. A couple of minutes went buy when she again commented on a low flying plane being followed by a ufo.. The ufo was spotted by the whole family when the two oldest ones had just arrived from making a trip to the grocery store. We first thought it was a balloon that someone had released; but realized it wasnt going straight up and realized it was going the same path of the plane. The object was heading west; it was rotating with blinking lights on the bottom. We stayed out there for five minutes till finally we couldnt see it anymore. The ojbject was going the same speed as an airplane.... I never believed in ufos till that day i witnessed one... jesse"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17133.html"],"Summary":"Metallic object rotating towards the west coming from the east.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"05/22/2009 07:15 UTC","Longitude":"-97.724487","Log Number":"US-05252009-0009","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.384226,+-97.724487(17133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17133) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.384226","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Mustang","There were no other sightings in Mustang on or around May 22nd 2009"],"Region":"Oklahoma","City":"Mustang","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/22/2009 07:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"17133"}
