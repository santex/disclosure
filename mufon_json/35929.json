Curious as to what they may be doing, I got out the camera and began taking pictures. These contrails were continuously appearing over a 2-3 hour period, and were alot more than there usually are which is what grabbed my attention. I took the memory card out of the camera, and took them to the PC to enlarge them to see if there was anything I hadn't personally seen with the naked eye. I am sending the photo which includes an unknown, glowing object, as well as the contrails that got my attention to begin taking pics. I did not seee this object with the naked eye.but the contrails were pretty impressive............"]}
