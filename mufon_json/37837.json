The object made no noise and traveled at not a very high rate of speed there were no blicking lights and no smoke from the object. We got a little scared so we called for my boyfriend to come see when he got out side it was still in the sky traveling south, he aslo watched the object for a few minutes then he went inside to get the camera and before he even got back outside it just disappered. The object would be very hard to describe because it was so bright just like a glowing ball it's movment was so smooth and moved in a straight line but then just vanished it was there and then just gone. It was a very uneasy feeling it scared my daughter and left me feeling worried I have never had anything like that happen to me before and could have lived with out it."],"Log Number":"US-04292012-0015","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"38.132537"}
