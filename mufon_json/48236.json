Looking up in the sky I spotted ths objectin the sky. At first I dismissed it because it didn't seem to move, but all of a sudden it began to move. It had three lights to it, and seemed very high in the sky, and far up. Once it started to move I noticed the lights were not blinking. Most aircraft thier lights blink so thought this was weird. Once it went to the right of a tree, and telephone pole I lost site of it. Not saying it was a UFO, but seemed wierd so thought I'd report it."],"Latitude":"45.951419","City":"Milton-Freewater","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"48236","Region":"Oregon","Date Submitted":"06/18/2013 10:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-118.388828"}
