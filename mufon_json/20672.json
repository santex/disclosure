{"divs":["sighting detailson 7\\4\\2004 at approximately 10pm, my son(13) and i(33) were laying a trampoline at a friends house in the back yard looking at the night sky. i told him if he looked close he could see satelites as they passed by circling the globe. we saw two and he was very fascinated. we then began to locate constelations, the big dipper, the little dipper and so on. when we looked to the west i noticed what seemed to be a bright star. i asked my son if he seen it and he replied yes. then the star moved, i then thought maybe it was a helicopter or plane. i realized that it didn't have any strobes and it moved from side to side in a zig zag type pattern. i approximate it was maybe a mile away. i asked my son, do you see that? he replied, yes. i then asked him, what is it doing? he replied, zig zagging! i wanted to make sure that i, was not seeing things! since it was at a distance we could not hear any type of engine noise. we could not make out a shape at this time, just points of very bright light. the movement of this vehicle was very precise, it seems to be scanning the area. to describe it, it seemed like it was suspened from a string because it never changed elevation. the movement reminded me of a computer printer, sharp precise side to side irratic motion. within seconds it was approximately 100-200 yards away, and now we could see that the points of light formed a triangle or diamond type shape. that is when it basically stopped in mid air!!! there still was not a sound, complete silience and now it was moving toward us very slowly unlike anything i have ever witnessed. this object was not flying, i am not an expert on flying, but i do know planes and helicopters must maintain a certain air speed to maintain lift. planes bank when they turn and make a distinct noise. helicopters can hover and make tons of noise. this was not a hover, just a complete stop. then it seemed as if the vehicle could see us and it began to head towards us. at that point i admit, i was scared, i grabbed my son by his shirt and pulled him off the trampoline heading to the front of the house where everone else was located. the whole time i kept a visual on the object and it then turned sharp towards the north and in a second or two it was gone. once in the front of the house we asked had anyone else seen what we had. everyone looked at us like we were crazy. both my son and i were very excited and scared at the same time. if i had to guess the size of the object was approximately 30-60ft in diameter with points of light on the either three to four corners. to this day i ask my son about that night and he remembers it like it just happened. to say the least it has made and impact on both of us. we both concluded that it was definitely a u.f.o. not a plane, helicopter, blimp, hot air balloon, firework, flare, lantern, etc. i wish i had not become frightened so i could have observed it longer, but my instinct to protect my son kiked in because i honestly did not know what we were witnessing."],"Summary":"Do you see what I see?","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.557031,+-105.777447(20672)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20672) map </A>","Case Number":"20672","Latitude":"39.557031","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2004 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-105.777447","Tags":"City","trends":[],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-11232009-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20672.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20672.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/23/2009 05:23 UTC","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like, Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Region":"Colorado"}
