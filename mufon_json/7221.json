{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDescription: It or they were way to brite and far to see the shape. They all met at one point , after which they seemed to form this triangle pattern. I saw one at first , followed it around city. It stopped at a point were it met up with 2 more lites. The object i followed then put out a very brite lite. After which it faded. Then the next object put out a even brighter lite. Then a couple of blinking lites showed up. I think there were 6 in all. When they met they all seemed to form this triangle pattern.
