When I went to the car to unload, I saw some flashes out of the corner of my eye. When I looked up, I saw a huge rectangular shaped craft. At first I didn't know what to think. It flashed two short flashes and 1 long flash at me, then it was gone. It reminded me a huge fluorescent light. It had 3 or 4 rows of blue 'bulbs'. This was after I saw the 4 lights for 4 or 5 hours, earlier on the drive in the Nevada desert."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7613.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7613.html"],"Latitude":"40.58786"}
