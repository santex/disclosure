The object in the photo shows a bright yellow color which looks like it could be from exhaust; the direction is wrong for it to be a reflection from the sun or a sundog. I did not see the object when shooting the photo or with the naked eye. I do not recall any sound either."],"Case Number":"25188","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
