{"City":"Chicago","divs":["sighting detailsi was at the chicago jazzfest, laying down in the grass around 8:15 or so. i look up at the sky and it was dusky but about 15-20 min from being nighttime so it was a wierd dark purplish-red color. i hadn't had any alcohol in over a week and no illegal substances in months if not years. i look up at the sky and see what appears to be a plane moving in a north\\northwesternly direction at a moderate speed. i gain some perspective by focusing more and realize that if this was a plane it would be ridiculously high in the air based on how i was unable to make out a shape and could only see the lights from the bottom (white-ish). also the light kinda flickered a little but i wasnt sure if it was just clouds passing between the object and my field of sight or not. i follow the plane as it moves across the sky thinking to myself i thought planes always had colored lights on the bottom but dismissed it. i kept thinking, man this plane is really far up there i wonder why. i had been watching the plane for maybe 5-10 min when i saw another passenger jumbo jet presumably coming from o'hare airport. this plane looked normal and to be of a normal flying altitude. as it got closer to the \"plane\" i had been watching i noticed that the altitude of the \"plane\" i was originally watching had to be at least 2.5x greater. at this point i noticed that the \"plane\" also came to a complete halt. i called it to the attention of my friend that i came with and she watched along too. as the commercial plane flew under and past this \"plane\" began moving again in the same direction. now i was concerned b\\c i know that there are super high altitude planes but i dont think we have the technology yet to reach such high altitudes and also come to a complete stop and hover there. anyway i started to focus all my attention on this one object. from the time the \"plane\\star\" started moving again, it took roughly 2-3 seconds for it to get back up to its original velocity. second point of interest b\\c i also dont think we have the technology to go from what appears to be standstill to say...mach2 in that short a time. so i'm still watching the \"plane\\star\" thing when i saw it bust a 90 turn and head what would appear to be either south completely east or just down closer to earth. now i'm super concerned b\\c a plane moving at that speed should not have that type of agility. from there i watched go through a series of complete stops to mad 5 second dashes with other 90turns mixed in. at this point me and the other witness were completely convinced this was more of a ufo than some governmental experimental aircraft. so at this point i had been watching the ufo for at least 35-40 minutes, and it was now completely dark in the sky so other stars were out. i had only been focused on this one \"star\\ufo\" thing the whole time so had not paid any attention to anything else in the sky save the one commercial plane that flew by. so now for contrast i looked at some of the other stars and my friend commented that it looked like some of the other ones were moving too. so now i chose a few stars closer to the original one i had been watching so as not to lose it, and noticed that indeed they were. the other stars i focused on were considerably less dim and presumably further up in the sky. however they were also coming to these start\\stop\\mad dash type of movements as well, however i didnt look at any of the others to see them do the 90 turns. now i'm really worried because i'm starting to think this is an invasion or some super alien reconnaissance mission. i figured if it were experimental aircraft there's no way in hell the gov't could siphon away that much money to secretly build that many super advanced aircraft as there were at least 10-15 erratically moving objects in the sky. the original one i was watching remained the brightest and presumably the most close to me. i was concerned about them initiating an attack or beaming me up or something but i wanted to verify if this was something that was out of our atmosphere or just appeared to be first. so i called my friend in puerto rico and asked him to go outside and look at the stars to tell me if his were moving as well. he did, i waited and sure enough he said no they werent. he looked around for a bit and preceded to tell me about what happened to him the night before. but i got off the phone because i was more interested in the stars moving around all crazy where i was. the fact that he couldnt see them told me that they werent all the way out of the atmosphere or else they should be visible from pr as well, but they were indeed much closer to chicago. so then i decided we should leave just in case something happened and we then left after about a 1.5 hrs of watching and the original brightest ufo was still sitting up in the sky, at that point it was at a standstill. i have a witness so i know i'm not crazy. points i would like to make: 1. high altitude planes must maintain a certain speed to remain at altitudes of that magnitude, that's a fact. no helicopter could possibly be like 50,ooo ft off the ground. 2. high altitude planes are quick and nimble to a degree, but not 90 degree turn nimble. i think of a plane with super agility and i think of like an su-27 or something but even that can not make turns of that nature at super high altitudes like that, and especially hover at them. 3. a jet engine plane can have amazing acceleration, but going from a standstill to some ridiculous speed in under 3 seconds is not possible, especially with whatever friction it would experience at a height of that magnitude. 4. i watched the original \"plane\\ufo\" for over an hour. to reach super high altitude requires an ordinate amount of fuel, i imagine planes of that nature would have to make their trip and then hurriedly come back to be refueled. to fit the amount of fuel it would take to be lolly-gagging around in subspace for over an hour on a plane aerodynamically equipped to make such agile turns would require a fuel tank probably bigger than the plane itself, unless there is some alternate energy source the gov't has that they are hiding from us. 5. were this to be erratic movements of just stars or something else out of this atmosphere, then it should be visible to people in other places. granted i only called one person in pr but he probably would've seen something as many objects were moving around all crazy from where i was looking up. 6. if these were a bunch of experimental gov't crafts then uncle sam is pilfering an absurd amount of money from taxpayers and somebody somewhere should be fired if they havent noticed the national budget misappropriating 500 bil or whatever it would take to come up with the r & d to make something that performs like this and also make a bunch of them 7. i have an unnamed witness and i've told multiple people already so if this were some gov't conspiracy and i basically just told on myself throught this website then the government will have to \"quiet\" alot of people in the near future besides just me."],"Object
