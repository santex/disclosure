We were driving up McClelland ave. (Also in Erie) around 10:25 p.m. EST. when I happened to look up into sky out the left side of my car and noticed a stationary object hovering about 100 yards off the ground about a mile away from us. I told everyone that there was an object over in the sky. Everyone thought it was a U.F.O., even me. I could still see the object at my house, but i had to go inside and go to bed. Before I went inside, it had started moving very slowly towards the ESE. I guessed it would have lasted about five minutes longer until it disappeared over the herizon after I went inside. Can anybody tell me if you saw the same thing or if it was real?"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Three orange balls of light in triangular form.","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"42.136324","Longitude":"-80.079309","City":"Erie","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03232010-0011","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Erie","There were no other sightings in Erie on or around July 4th 2009"],"Region":"Pennsylvania"}
