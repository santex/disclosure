It wasn't hard to miss because they were bigger than the stars. We also saw planes around the same area where the orange orbs appeared and there was a difference with the lights. My husband then pulled over into the driveway and we stared at the sky and noticed the orange orbs slowly changing position and some orbs disappearing and reappearing. My husband grabbed our camera took a picture and the orange orbs slowly disappeared."],"Region":"New Jersey","Country":"United States","Case Number":"51191","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.004253"}
