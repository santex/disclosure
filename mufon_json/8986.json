{"Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Region":"Texas","City":"Weatherford","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw three distinct sets of lights, one small light on top a larger light, two fairly close together, one some distance away. I watched for approx. five minutes, they did not move. It was a cystral clear night, lots of stars and constellations. I looked at lights through 50X bonoculars and they were artificial, and the small light did not look to be connected to the large light.My guess at the time was satelites. It was cold, I got tired of looking, went in the house.
