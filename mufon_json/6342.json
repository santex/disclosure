ray turned the tahiti around so i wasn't facing the light and told me to relax. i kept turning around and looking because they were not turning off their lights. then, i noticed that the lights were getting higher in the trees, which didn't make sense. i then became very startled when i realized the lights were actually now at the treetops. i said \"oh my god ray...look!!! it's rising!!! we watched it get higher and higher, above the trees!! as it got higher, we could see that it was much bigger and brighter. we were both freaked out and started heading back to shore. i then spotted shawn and debbie's flashlight waving and although we couldn't make out their boat yet, we started screaming for them and they were screaming for us. as we got closer to them, we could hear them screaming, \"do you see it???!!!?...do you see it????\" it was so huge and soooo bright and just ever so slowly rose in the sky. as it rose, it was going away from us. we all sat in our boats and watched it slowly rise for about 2 hours. as we compared events, the told us that they too could not get far from shore because their boat would spin. debbie said that shawn picked up his flashlight and started waving it when the light was at the treetops. she got scared and made him put it out. she didn't want to draw attention to them. she thought it was a ufo at that point, and she believes that whatever it was that she saw earlier in the sky, had something to do with this object that we were now witnessing. after it was quite high in the sky, all the ripples in the lake suddenly subsided and we had no problem paddling our boats. we were thoroughly exhausted by this time and getting quite cold so we decided to go back to camp. shawn and i took up the first load from our boats. when we came back, debbie and ray had noticed that they could see what looked like thousands of fish across the lake from us, all along the shoreline...the same side as the earlier flashes which we thought was lightning, the same side that the object seemed to fall from the sky, the same side that the light appeared on the mountain. co-incidence??? i doubt it. phenomenon?...we perceived it as some magnetic occurrence in the water due to whatever it was that rose off of that mountain. i couldn't let it go. everyone else finally fell asleep, but i sat on the ground watching this light move further and further away. finally, around 7:00 in the morning, i couldn't watch any longer. the object now appeared to be the brightness of a distant star. the sun was out and all the stars in the sky were gone...except for what was left of this object that rose in the sky before my eyes, several hours earlier. i tried to draw the shape of this incredibly bright object. i'm not sure how to explain it. it was a shaped most like an oval but it kind of had an indentation on top of it. it's hard to describe the shape of a huge, bright, moving, light. a few years after our sighting, my son was watching a program on t.v. about ufo sightings. he yelled for me to come listen because a couple of men were telling their story and it was very much like ours. same scenario...on a lake, at night, even waved their flashlights towards it. but they said their light came towards them and now some 10 -20 years later, they are having dreams of abduction! about 2 years ago, i received a phone call from a friend of mine whom i had told my experience to. she said that she was listening to one of the radio stations in our area. the subject was talking about ufo's and someone called in saying that they had experienced a ufo sighting at applegate lake. according to my friend, the caller had been camping in the area around the same time that we were. i know that what we witnessed was paranormal. i am so thankful that our friends were there to collaborate our experience with this unusual event!"],"Log Number":"US-02082007-0002","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Applegate","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval, Other","Region":"Oregon"}
