I was getting back from buying fireworks in Stephenville, TX on December 31, 2007. It was around 6:00. I was in the car with my dad and my friend, they both saw the thing in the sky also. There was a very bright light in the sky traveling very very fast, about 2-3 times bigger than a star, a second light popped up, very close to the first one, for about 30 seconds, then dissappeared, but the first light was still there. Tuesday the 8th of January wasn't the only day we saw the UFO."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"9067","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
