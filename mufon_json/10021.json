(and no, this was not like the jupiter ii from lost in space but a lot more polished and streamlined than that.) i believe there were additional, larger circles\\lights on the outside of the colored lights. there were no legs or wheels that i could see. no light or anything emanated from the craft. i did have the sensation it was simply checking me out. i do not know if i experience what you would call missing time. i did see my friend afterward as they had some new puppies i wanted to see. i did not tell them about the plane (why should i as i had no idea this was something that should not be in the sky?) there was no noise that i recall, nor vapor trail. it flew off, moving higher in altitude in the same direction from which it came. i think that i did tell my mother when i went home about the round airplane with no wings. i'm sure she was amused. not much of a ufo buff or obsessive but i do believe in what i saw and trust my childhood memory of it."],"Date Submitted":"07/21/1966 12:00 UTC","Summary":"daylight sighting hovering craft directly overhead and low to ground","Date of the Event":"07/21/1966 12:00 UTC","City":"Charleston","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-03232008-0008","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10021.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10021.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10021.html"],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Charleston","There were no other sightings in Charleston on or around July 21st 1966"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"10021","Source":"MUFON"}
