{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details I was walking my dog on March 7, 2013 around 8:45pm and I noticed a bright red-orange circle with white lights on the bottom. I thought it was a helicopter but no flashing lights and no sound. I kept walking and maybe 20 seconds later another red-orange circle appeared, then another one and another one. Im not sure if there were 5 or 6 because I was fumbling with my phone calling people to tell them to go out and look and then I tried to get some pictures. The lights all started in the same spot, were moving at a rather slow speed, equidistant and in a slightly curved line. My husband said the last one stopped and hovered for a while. I started thinking thats really weird, it didnt look like the usual stuff you see in the night sky. I watched as the lights followed each other and then they were gone."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03082013-0003","City":"Citrus Heights","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Citrus Heights","There was one other sighting in Citrus Heights on or around March 7th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46081.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46081.html"],"Summary":"5-6 bright red-orange lights moving in slowish, equidistant, straightish line in the evening sky over Citrus Heights","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"38.709785","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-121.275511","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.709785,+-121.275511(46081)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46081) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/07/2013 08:45 UTC","Case Number":"46081","Date Submitted":"03/08/2013 06:03 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"California"}
