It seemed to come out of nowhere, but he wasn���t focusing on it at the start. When he did focus on object, it was moving overhead of his location heading southwest, slower than the first object (ref case 43210) but was definitely not a plane. It was close and he could make out details. As it passed overhead, it was actually two circles (looked about the size of basketballs) in a line almost touching each other. The witness thought they might have been connected. The objects seemed close to the ground, (lower than a plane would fly, when the objects were almost directly overhead he could clearly make out some details. The objects were a dark red, somewhat translucent with a circle in the middle of each of the bigger circles and straight lines running from the outside edge to the center on both, the center was like a lighter or greyer red than the rest of the object. The object didn���t give off a bright light, it was more like a really dim glow, not casting red light down on him or illuminating the rest of the area. The objects passed over fairly slow and lasting about 2 to 3 minutes. The objects then sort of disappeared in the SW, behind the high-rise buildings in downtown Grand Rapids."],"Case Number":"45148","Longitude":"-85.650716","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45148.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45148.html"],"City":"Grand Rapids","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"10/13/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were 3 other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around October 13th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.967325,+-85.650716(45148)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45148) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Latitude":"42.967325","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/11/2013 10:55 UTC"}
