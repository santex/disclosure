We left my daughter's home (2 mi from Ellerbe going home). We noticed a bright light more brighter than the sun. We were struck with awe and amazement. We did not say anything to each other until we left the wooded area. I can not say anything about this in my town. I have lived in Ellerbe for 47 years. The church I attend is Presbyterian and they have a different opinion on a lot of things as well as I served on the board of deacons. I know of a person who works with the CIA. I had to keep mum around that individual. I would like to know if someone else has had the same experience as my wife and I have had. If so, e-mail me at wep_1941@yahoo.com. Thanks a lot if you read and believe this report."],"Date of the Event":"04/15/1994 10:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.94915,+-79.768526(16671)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16671) map </A>","Summary":"Bright light at night.","Log Number":"US-04252009-0009","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16671.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16671.html"]}
