until around 7:45 p.m. so i believe it was spring\\summer\\fall in southwestern new mexico. the drive from las cruces to deming is about an hour. there is a border patrol stop about halfway between las cruces and deming. i was driving about the speed limit, which at that time i believe was 65 mph. a few miles before i reached the border patrol station i noticed in my rear view mirror what i thought was a large plane moving very fast toward me. i thought it was a plane because in the glint of the sun toward it, the underside was shiny. i was startled because i could see it in my rear view mirror and it was moving very fast. i thought it was a plane from el paso that was going to crash but i didn't hear any sound, which i thought was because my radio was on. i prepared myself to hear it roar over me continuing west but it never passed over me, which was odd considering how fast it was moving into view of my rear view mirror and then out of it (from east to west). it never came over and i looked from right to left (north to south) and noticed an object to my left, at what i thought was a mile to the left (or south of interstate 10). i thought it must be a plane or helicopter but it didn't quite seem like that's what it was but in my mind i thought it must be one or the other but flying low, lower than a private plane and it was not painted green and white for a border patrol helicopter. altogether the view of it was not very clearly a plane or helicopter but was closer in shape to a plane without wings (like a small jet) but i don't recall a tail on it. i came up to the border patrol station and i don't remember if it was open or not but i forgot about the object flying on the left until after i went over the akela pass. at that point i looked to my left and the object was still there. this struck me as odd because it was still in the same position and it now looked like a cigar shaped object but there was still a lot of glint off it from what was now a setting sun. as i drove toward deming the florida mountains are on the south side of i-10. the object was moving at about the same rate as my car, which i found strange, and it stayed fairly low in the sky. when i drove past the florida mountains, the object stayed in the sky between i-10 and the floridas but in the same spot in the sky still moving at the same speed i was toward deming. it stayed in the same spot in the sky until i arrived in deming. i headed slightly north of the city to my destination. when i stopped my car i looked for the object in the sky and it was in a set position in the southwestern sky. by this time it was twilight and lights were coming from underneath the object. i do not recall what color they were but they did seem to blink on and off somewhat but not steady like a plane. i had noticed lights earlier when the object was passing the florida mountains. for about an hour i went in and out of the house to see if the object was still in the same position in the southwest and it was. i showed it to two family members who saw the light and outline of the object in the sky and they also checked it with me for that hour. finally i decided to wait longer and see if it was still there. i waited two hours (about 10:00 p.m.) to check again and the object was no longer in the sky. the whole event struck me as strange and i remember it to this day and one of my family members also remembers how much it affected me. the thing is, i drove that stretch of road between las cruces and deming almost daily for three years and i'd never experienced anything like that at all. that stretch of i-10 can be frequently very heavily populated with 18-wheelers and many personal vehicles. however, there are many times when there was not much traffic and i would find myself alone for long stretches (5 and even 10 miles), especially on week days. when the object was coming up in my rear view mirror it was one of those stretches where i was the only car in sight. between the florida mountains and deming there was light traffic that evening. occasionally, closer to deming there are crop dusters spraying but this object was not like that and the crop dusters clearly look like planes."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
