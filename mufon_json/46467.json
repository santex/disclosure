Also, they said they thought it was a flock of birds which is what we thought first too!!!! So, I would say based on their definition, signting 32753 was identical to 31245, mainly due to the things I didn't say in my report that they did say. Thank You. P.S. Your form to report things like this is too lengthy with all those checkboxes....."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46467.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46467.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.436549,+-122.763646(46467)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46467) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Chevron","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/28/2013 10:11 UTC"}
