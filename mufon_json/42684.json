I ran inside to get my video camera which I now bought and brought it outside, turned it on and tried to focus in on the object. I zoomed in as far as my camera would go and now the object did not appear star like but rather diamond shapped. The camera had a hard time focusing in and as I pressed the record button, the object blinked out and dissappeared. I kept observing for a few minutes more but it did not reappear. About 10 minutes later a Navy twin engine plane and some sort of jet which I couldnt make out what type it was were flying around low and high. Object did not reappear."],"Latitude":"25.946726","Log Number":"US-09202012-0016","Summary":"star like object observed briefly then disappeared.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.477845","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.946726,+-97.477845(42684)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42684) map </A>","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like","Date of the Event":"09/20/2012 07:30 UTC","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"09/20/2012 09:45 UTC"}
