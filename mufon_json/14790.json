{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe night very clear and cold with moon shine and no clouds. As I was closing curtains on the south side of the house, I stood and watched the sky for a while. Than from the left, which is east, an ovel shaped object came into view. It had one solid very bright white light and flashed a very bright white light. Right behind it, was a small sphere. It was a dull to lite red color. Following like a caboose on a train. I compared the first object to other planes in the area, and it was not a plane. I have never ever seen anything like that. And I knew it was not a plane. After 10 minutes,it disappeared behind trees, close to the horizon."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14790.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14790.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/05/2009 09:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/05/2009 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.665049,+-86.075836(14790)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14790) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Osceola","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-86.075836","Latitude":"41.665049","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Log Number":"US-01062009-0004","Summary":"A big blinking oval shaped UFO and a smaller following right behind it.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Osceola","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"14790","Tags":"City"}
