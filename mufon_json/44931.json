Many(maybe 25) red orbs appeared as a Fleet coming in my direction above the trees. One had something come out of the bottom. They dissolved and 25 more came towards me.Then, shortly they disappeared too. I was freaking out. Never have seen anything like this. My husband saw it and thinks it must have been floating lanterns. He does not believe in UFOs. I have never seen lanterns around here. It looked like a fleet of UFOs to me. I was very excited.Very bright red color and round."],"Case Number":"44931","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"27.888497","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
