{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving north on highway 53 and spotted a long rectangular object in the sky that was thin in profile but grey\\silver in color and somewhat bright due to the sun. in the time it took for me to blink the object just disappeared. i scanned the sky, but it was no where to be found. this was about quarter to 10 in the morning central standard time. i was traveling in between solon springs wi and lake nebagamon wi, but just outside solon springs when i saw the object in the sky slightly above the tree line. frankly, i stepped on the gas to try to get closer to possibly photograph the object but by the time i thought about doing that the object was gone. it flew above the trees in a straight line going east for a while then it seemed to be moving further away going north east, then it was gone as if it just vanished into thin air."],"Date of the Event":"08/29/2012 09:44 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Solon Springs","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-91.822411","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42124.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42124.html"],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08292012-0006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"long rectangular shape, thin profile, reflective silver very bright","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Wisconsin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.353274,+-91.822411(42124)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42124) map </A>","City":"Solon Springs","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"08/29/2012 01:26 UTC","Case Number":"42124","Latitude":"46.353274"}
