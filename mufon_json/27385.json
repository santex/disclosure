Looked like a 'planet', larger than stars. Thought it was a planet. It continued to 'glow' and light up sky, no beams, just bright glow, then the object rose upward to above 'plane' height, then higher, blacking out as it rose and becoming luminous again several times until it was out of sight 'beyond the stars', about 20 min. time involved. There was no cloud cover to explain the disappearing and re-appearing of the object so I assumed it was offing it's own luminescence. I called a family member from the area to see if she could see it from her point in the area, but it wasn't visible to her from house windows but she couldn't see the sky above the house before it was gone. I took a picture of it with my camera but will have to forward that picture to you later. Was wondering if you had any other reports of such in the near area?"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"27385","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Harrodsburg","There were no other sightings in Harrodsburg on or around January 14th 2011"],"Latitude":"37.762298","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Kentucky","Longitude":"-84.843285","City":"Harrodsburg","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.762298,+-84.843285(27385)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27385) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/14/2011 07:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"larger n brighter than stars, moving outward, random stop/blackout/glowing til disappeared, no other light color","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-01142011-0003","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None"}
