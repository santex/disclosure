{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI just want to let you know that it wasn't a UFO. You described and pictured the International Space Station with Shuttle attached and 13 member crew on board. Really great view of them last night. They passed over Ohio at 9:27 pm and went west to east and was visible for 4 minutes. Look it up. It's just amazing how many people still must not know about the ISS because of so many reports here that describe it. Please people, look up the ISS viewing opportunities first before posting."],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"40.425417","Case Number":"18341","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.897193","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07272009-0005","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.425417,+-82.897193(18341)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18341) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"07/26/2009 09:27 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/26/2009 09:27 UTC","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18341.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18341.html"],"Summary":"To the person reporting bright light from Ohio and other who don't know about ISS","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
