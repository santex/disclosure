I sometimes document them when they get really bad. I shot a few short video clips, some I aimed right at the sun. When I downloaded these images and began to view them, I noticed little white \"orbs\" shooting past one of the planes. Three of them, traveling parallel with the plane all traveling at different speeds (breakneck!) and one appears to go through a cloud(chem-cloud).(first 2 seconds, upper left) Also the second one, (use the pause button frequently when the sun is center frame.) I counted at least 8-10 of these things appearing, disappearing and moving in and out of the solar glare. The few people with scientific phd.'s I showed these to are scratching their heads. I am a little nervous sending them, as they appeared to be \"working\" with the planes...some new technology?!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
