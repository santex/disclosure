I was in my back yard looking to the south west sky. I was looking for a strange light I saw on may 3 and I had my cam corder on me.I was looking outside for about 10 to 15 minutes when something from the south caught my eye.2 bright redish orange lights about treetop level started dissapearing and reappearing.I started recording the objects as they hovered and decended very slowly and dissapeared. I turned my camera off and figured that was it. All of the sudden one reappeared.I turned my camera back on and the object moved a bit west then vanished. The area that I recorded these objects was the same area as the ones I recorded in 6-20-11 and 6-16-08. I have seen these things over here quite a few times. The video I am attaching to this is in two parts because its from when I started recording and they dissapeared and I thought they were done, then they reappeared and I turned my camera on and started recording again."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Date Submitted":"05/06/2012 09:43 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Region":"Indiana","Latitude":"39.59481","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"37970","Summary":"2 pulsating lights treetop level","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Greenwood","There was one other sighting in Greenwood on or around May 5th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"05/05/2012 10:15 UTC"}
