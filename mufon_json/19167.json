Noticed two very bright objects traveling at a high rate of speed in unison or formation going from a southwest to a northeast direction. There were no FAA required lighting such as a strobe light or nav. lights and there was no sound. They appeared to have a slight turn or curve pattern. We eventually lost sight because the lights went behind our rather large threes on our lot.I was so amazed I had my wife look at this as well. We have no explaination for what we saw."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09082009-0040","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Elizabeth","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Noticed 2 very bright objects moving southwest to northeast atahigh rate of speed had a slight curvature of flight pattern.","Date Submitted":"09/08/2009 11:48 UTC","Case Number":"19167","Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
