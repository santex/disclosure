It looked pretty good in size and I was in shock when I first saw it then my friends saw it and were very amazed. It seemed to have the shape of a scorpion or dragon fly. It seemed close to the top of our tall trees and somewhat at a medium pace in movement there was no sound coming from the object. The lights flickered. We were mezmorized by what we saw and in disbelief. We watched it head away in the distance quite a ways and then it disappeared. We did get video on the iphone."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"41725","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
