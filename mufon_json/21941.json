{"Country":"United States","City":"Overland Park","Case Number":"21941","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"flash of light followed by the top of a tree catching fire","Tags":"City","Region":"Kansas","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving down 435 going west changing lanes to take highway 10 to DeSoto. There was a bright light on the eastbound lanes. I thought it might be a giant truck with bright, bright lights about the size and brightness of 25 headlights. There was an accompanying humming sound. Then the top of a tree in the middle of all the highways burst into flames and as I drove by, it continued to burn. Then the light was gone. I just on to work and everybody else kept driving too. So did anybody else see this? I was startled by the light and the fire. I thought everyone saw it but was ignoring it. I was a little scared but I just drove on to work, like everyone else. When I drove by the spot after work, I didn't think about the spot and didn't look for the tree. :("],"Date of the Event":"02/19/2010 07:50 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/19/2010 08:28 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Overland Park","There was one other sighting in Overland Park on or around February 19th 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.985028","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02192010-0008","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21941.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21941.html"],"Longitude":"-94.667012","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.985028,+-94.667012(21941)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21941) map </A>"}
