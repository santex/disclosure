When i got home i looked on u-tube and the closest thing to what i had experienced was the video of the woman seeing a ufo at the world tRade center in nyc...it even shows the exhaust streaks left in the sky in its path...so, to me, that confimed what i had just experienced was indeed a ufo. this was my second sighting in rockland county, the first was in OCTOBER of 1986...as i arrived home from graduate school one thursday nite about 10 pm..that object was also completely silent, but it was ENORMOUS...the size of a football field...and VERY LOW...just over the treetops...i remember getting out of my car, looking up, and there it was...i remember freezing and watching, awestruck, as it disappeared over the mountains toward SOUTH MOUNTAIN ROAD...TRAVELLING IN A NORTH EAST DIRECTION TOWARD THE HUDSON RIVER AND THE INDIAN POINT FACILITY...i remember wondering if it had FOLLOWED me THAT NITE as i travelled home from pace university in northern westchester SOUTH ON THE SAW MILL RIVER PARKWAY toward the TAPPAN ZEE bridge and then WEST over to rockland and NORTH ON THE PALISADES PARKWAY TO MY HOME IN POMONA...I HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAR ON THE ROAD THAT NITE FOR MILES AND MILES...ALL ALONE...OR SO I THOUGHT...UNTIL ARRIVING HOME...I JUST PARKED MY CAR, GOT OUT, LOOKED UP TO THE SKY...AND SAW IT...years later, i learned of the book NIGHT SIEGE, which confirmed what had happened to me was an actual ufo sighting...the one i saw that night was round and solid (against a beautiful star-lit October sky its solid nature was quite obvious)...and it had lights all along the perimeter...either all red or all white...i was in awe, in shock, and terrified all at the same time...the second experience, yesterday, was also surprising...but as you can imagine i was already a believer...i am a fifty-something year old with a college education and can say one thing for sure...once you see it for yourself, you BELIEVE! Hopefully these are enlightened beings here to watch over, protect,and keep us safe...one and all...That's what I chose to believe anyway...But why some of us are seeing them and others aren't, i'm not sure...why i looked up at exactly the right moment...TWICE...i don't know... that puzzles and intrigues me...but I'll let you guys figure that one out!"],"Log Number":"US-04232008-0012","Longitude":"-73.996113"}
