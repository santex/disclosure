And once again right around 11 my friend mike and I noticed that every thing was eerily quite and the street lights started to just turn on and off but we thought that was normal. But then they started going all spastic then they just stopped and right as mike looked down at his phone to say \"weird it's 11:11\" a very loud rustle and thump came from the waters edge and I locked eyes with a massive being that was 7 to 9 feet tall skinny, slender and it was dragging a massive bag. One that looked like u put a Christmas tree in but what terrified me were its pure white glowing Florescent eyes and then dipped under the bridge... Tears still come to my eyes when I talk about this and I'm absolutely serious that I had to draw it to just get it off my mind because it was just burned into me as an image"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
