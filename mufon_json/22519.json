It caught my attention because it was orange, where usual helicopters have a white glow. I stared at it for a few seconds and then it started dropping smaller white lights, and my first reaction was that it was dropping bombs. I didn���t think it was a UFO at this point, I thought it was an army helicopter or other army aircraft. I left my room to go get my mom���s camera and returned with her and the camera only to find that the mysterious orange light was gone. I looked throughout all the windows in the house, it was nowhere in sight. I thought about it and brushed it off and a ���helicopter dropping flares��� because it was the only logical explanation I could come up with. This was at approximately midnight on March 27, 2010. About an hour later, I woke up and my window was still open. It was then I saw that the smaller crafts that were dropped were all clustered and flying around in unusual patterns in the North West sky out of my window. I looked at them for four hours and couldn���t figure it out. I���m positive that they were what came out of the orange glowing craft. They would fly diagonally, horizontally, vertically, and make turns that couldn���t possibly be made by any aircraft here on Earth. I seen them appear from point A to point B. There was no trace of light as they flew because it was so fast. They, like the orange UFO, were silent. I watched them from 1:00 AM to about 5:00 AM then I thought I had enough and shut the blinds and tried to sleep. I didn���t see when, or if, they left, but I did hear a loud and unusually low jet fly by a little before sunset that woke me up. I checked, and didn���t see them anymore after that. The orange UFO was high in the open sky, and the white smaller ones were unusually lower than the mountain range that is outside my window. It was an extremely windy night so the sky was clear. I don���t see how I could be the only one to see this, I���m sure others seen it as well. It lasted for hours.
