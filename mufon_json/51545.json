The interesting part is that when we looked at the picture that was taken with an I phone we noticed tiny little orbs around each object that we couldn't see with the naked eye and when enlarged you could make out the bigger objects as Bright saucer shape. There were no other aircraft visible in the sky at the time of these sightings.The weather was clear with no clouds."],"Summary":"While driving North on interstate 5 noticed objects out of passenger window","Region":"California"}
