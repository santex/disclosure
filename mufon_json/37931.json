Saw a bright object in the western sky at about 70 to 90 degrees. We thought it was the space station or a satellite. A second bright object came up behind the first and went above and then below the first object. The second object was going at least 5 to 10 times faster than the first. Very fast and bright.No flames or light coming from rear of objects. We felt very strange and the hair was standing up on our arms and back of neck.The object went over horizon and out of sight."]}
