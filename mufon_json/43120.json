Upon looking above me while standing still I noticed a black, completely silent and dimly illuminated wing shaped object. The back edges had the appearance of being jagged. It was moving due west in an oddly strait and slow moving fashion unlike any aircraft I have ever seen, military or civilian. It was not a B-2 or F-117, it was a V shaped wing. It made a small course adjustment to southwest about 10 seconds or so after I originally saw it. The course adjustment was made when I looked away for a fraction of time. Roughly 15 seconds after it left eye sight my wife and I both saw a second one or the same craft, now coming from the north towards south east. We couldn't tell if it was one or two craft but both moved the same and looked the same. Gave us a good startle!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Highlands Ranch","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.548744,+-104.964206(43120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43120) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/09/2012 05:40 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
