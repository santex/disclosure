We all looked up into the sky to the south and saw 5 orange lights in a flying geese formation (V shape) One front light and one to the left and three to the right. It slowly moved to the south ( all lights moved together)for about 40 seconds then suddenly sped up and disappeared. There was no noise from the object which made it strange to us. We all were confused as to what it was and my siblings and I were afraid and decided not to camp out. Is there a aircraft that would fit this description?"],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Minnesota","Longitude":"-93.266967"}
