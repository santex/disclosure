Viewing location: Harrison Township, MI - on Lake Saint Clair - North of L���anse Creuse Bay. . Wife and I were sitting outside on the deck looking at the night sky, facing South. There were no clouds and visibility was near perfect. . I first noticed a small star colored object that was moving and pointed it out to my wife who then saw it easily. I keep a pair of 20 x 80 binoculars nearby and I immediately attempted to view the object through these. This took three attempts as the object was moving fast in a East-SE direction. . We live 2 miles South of the Selfridge Air National Guard Base. This object was nearly overhead, thus it was easily within the base���s restricted air space, of about a 5 mile radius. . When I finally got the binoculars lined up with the object it was already heading away from us. Still, it appeared about the size of a grape held at arm���s length. The light intensity was so bright that it could not have been a conventional aircraft. It was the color of a star. It���s shape was hard to distinguish due to the light intensity, but I would guess it was oval. The light did not have distinct edges. . As it continued away from us, it did not turn, descend or ascend. It continued straight, going East-SE over the lake, until the light diminished to a point and disappeared. Total viewing duration was about 20 seconds."],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"50116","City":"Harrison","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Harrison","There were no other sightings in Harrison on or around August 24th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 09:50 UTC","Latitude":"42.57083","Date Submitted":"08/24/2013 01:26 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
