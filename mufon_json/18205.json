(remember, the circles were about three or four months old when i first photographed them.) the area does have people in it, but (as you can see in the panorama photo) is pretty isolated nevertheless. the original photos are 12.75\" x 9.75\" at 300 dpi (about 9 megabytes each). the panorama is about 36\" wide at 300 dpi (22 megabytes). i can send you a cd with the original photos if you want."],"Log Number":"US-07202009-0017","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18205_submitter_file1__8661053109.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18205_submitter_file3__4870110108.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18205.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Windy, Heavy","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"36.397048","Longitude":"-105.282549","Summary":"Possible UFO landing site in hay field near Angel Fire, New Mexico","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.397048,+-105.282549(18205)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18205) map </A>"}
