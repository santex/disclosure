The craft was moving extremely slow. No sounds no blinking lights and lights of town seemed to reflect off it. It was a bronze to gold color with exterior protrusons. I new this was no plane because it was so low. The object proceded on a straight line and was still visible when i decided to go home to get a camera, when i got back it was gone. I live about five miles from the sighting. Was some what excited at first but had seen many others so just watched."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44360.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44360.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"08/19/1989 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Annville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","City":"Annville"}
