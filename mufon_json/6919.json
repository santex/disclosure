{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile on duty as a concierge in a Boca Raton condo, I was looking out into the Atlantic Ocean when I noticed a \"white\" object stationary approx. 50-100 feet above the ocean and 7-10 miles off the coast between Deerfield Beach and Boca Raton, FL. The object stayed stationary for about 20 minutes without no movement what so ever. Then, it slowly descended straight down till it \"touched\" the ocean's surface and remained there for about 3 minutes staying in one spot. The object then began to rise straight up, at a slow speed, till it was above the sporadic clouds that were in the area. Again, it stopped and remained stationary for about 20 minutes high up in the sky. At this point, heavy cloud cover moved in and I could no longer observe the object. This was not a bird, balloon, or para sail since I am familiar with the way they look out in the ocean. The only way I could describe it is as if it were the planet Venus out during the day."],"Summary":"Saw a white object stationary about 7-10 miles out in Atlantic Ocean.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.368188,+-80.079358(6919)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6919) map </A>","Date of the Event":"04/29/2007 03:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/29/2007 03:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.079358","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Boca Raton","There were no other sightings in Boca Raton on or around April 29th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-04292007-0005","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Boca Raton","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Object Features":"None, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6919.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6919.html"],"Latitude":"26.368188","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"6919","Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON"}
