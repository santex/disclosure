Then i said \"okay\", so we started to play catch in the backyard. In other words while we kept throwing the football back and forth, something caught my left corner eye and i thought it was an airplane so i starred at it a little bit, but then suddenly it was moving very very weirdly, it was moving like scribbling on paper, the object looked like a starry, sphere, bright, circle light in the sky, and like i said it was moving like scribbling on paper and then when it was moving to the right very slowly, and then it started to dim very softly,and then it just disappeared, also the object had no sound at all, just completely silent like it had no engine in it. My reactions was excited, thats all just excited, then i ran to the door inside my house then i told my dad \"hey dad i saw a UFO a little bit ago\" and he didnt believe me that much, he thought i was lying to him but it was real. Also the way i lost sight of the object was when it started to dim to the right it just disappeared."],"Latitude":"35.209129","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07162006-0011","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Case Number":"5093","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/22/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"10:21:27"}
