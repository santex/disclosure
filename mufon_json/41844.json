I watched it for about 30 seconds before I grabbed my phone and started filming. The object flew at me for about 20 more seconds before turning to my right, its left. It flew that way for a short time before turning back towards me. It flew over the hill behind my house, I then ran to the driveway to get a better angle. It suddenly did a U-turn very quickly and flew down behind the hill. I do have a video, however I tried to upload it once and it kicked me offline so I'm not attaching it this time. Duration of sight, 6-6.5 minutes."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08182012-0022","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41844.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Sevierville","There were no other sightings in Sevierville on or around August 18th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:06:30","City":"Sevierville","Date Submitted":"08/18/2012 10:10 UTC","Case Number":"41844","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
