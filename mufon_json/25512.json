We were watching fireworks around the area and across the river into Kansas City, Kansas. One of us happened to look up and saw a light coming in our direction at about 20 thousand feet(estimate). We started watching it and noticed that it had a steady whitish light. It came overhead and turned going back in the direction from where we say it first. Kind of a semi circle. When it was over head we heard no noise as we would have heard with a commercial plane. I took a picture with my phone, but it looks like a bright white dot. There were no flashing tail or wing lights, just the steady whitish light. There were other people there that started watching it also and they all said that it couldn't have been an airplane. We watched it until it went out of sight. I would have sent this earlier but just found out about your website. I have looked on the internet for anyone else who saw this but no luck."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-94.572587","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Kansas City","Source":"MUFON"}
