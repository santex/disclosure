(a math person could probably determine an exact size). i could not hear it making any sounds, and i have very good reaching. there was a haze surrounding ufo, but i couldn't say if it caused by the craft, or simply the amount of our atmosphere particulates at the time. about twenty seconds later it had gone past my southeastern horizon, and the fighter aircraft apparently was returning to its patrol. the saucer had traveled so far ahead of the fighter. i was a radar-man in the navy, so when i got back into my house, i immediately began trying to determine the ufo's course. the flash could have been about 70 miles north west of detroit (say about 300 degrees using a compass, on a course putting it between d.c. and norfolk. should i include the pilot of the aircraft as a witness? the chain-of-command need to snd the pilot on an intercept course. i don't know of any other witnesses. it was identical to the ufo's in a recent ytube release, where a couple of fighters seem to be following that ufo. and identical to \"filmed footage\" from the 60s of a saucer going into the tree line in some n.western state."],"Summary":"It moved from above northern horizon, to directly above, to south east horizon","Longitude":"-82.917109","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Roseville","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"42.520592","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Roseville","There were no other sightings in Roseville on or around October 25th 2001"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"39683","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06212012-0017","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/25/2001 10:30 UTC"}
