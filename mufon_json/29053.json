At first I thought it was birds but quickly realized it was a craft. It at first looked black with lights in the v shape on it's underside. It was completely silent and flying really low, seemed well below the clouds. It was heading East from the coast - as it was right above and over to the left, I couldn't tell if there was a craft under it because the lights seemed to distort. As it flew over the garage it was out of the line of sight. I was stunned for a second then i got up from the bench from where I was sitting and walked over the 10 feet to look where it was going and it was gone. Clearly, this was absolutely not any kind of optical illusion - it was a craft."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Carlsbad","Latitude":"33.164243","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29053.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29053.html"],"Longitude":"-117.340884","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.164243,+-117.340884(29053)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29053) map </A>","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Case Number":"29053","Summary":"Black Silent Plane with V-Shaped lights","Date of the Event":"05/10/2011 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-05112011-0007","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Tags":"City"}
