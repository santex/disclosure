The two sightings were similar in that they both became extremely bright letting off white light both either getting bigger or this may have been an effect from the lights brightness. So after what I had sighted earlier I kept popping back out side from time to time due to the fact it was nice out and there was clear visibility that night.I had been looking up and saw what I thought to be a lil satilite.as I watched it was shifting from green to blue in color moving at about a pace which a satelite would then all the sudden it almost tripled size or more as it became a very bright white cirlce then returned to its pin point size never changed speed and continued on over the horizon at which point I lost sight of the object."],"Date of the Event":"02/25/2009 07:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"15750","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15750.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Latitude":"42.433892","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.433892,+-87.918195(15750)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15750) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Wadsworth","There was one other sighting in Wadsworth on or around February 25th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-87.918195","Summary":"At first it looked to be what I though was maybe a satellite tripled or more in size and went below the horizon.","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02262009-0021","Country":"United States"}
