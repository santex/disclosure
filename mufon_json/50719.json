It was around twilight 7:15-30 pm. I noticed the pink sunset color in the sky that evening. I happened to looked up towards the NE and my eye caught a dark fuzzy boomerang(but fatter)object shooting across slightly above tree top level going in a straight line in a SE direction until it was out of sight. The color was black and it seem not quite solid. Noise or sound was not noticed. It did not look at all like a common aircraft or animal. The observation was about 1 second. The person next to me also caught a brief glimpse of something dark moving across the sky fast. She thought that it resembled a spotlight except it was black. Both of us said \"What??\" and thought it was strange. We did mention this to a third person who was looking down at that time. It was a strange footnote but we didn't dwell on it too long."],"Summary":"Around dusk I saw a dark fuzzy boomerang object shooting across tree top level going from NE to SE.","City":"Cranberry Township","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.707492,+-80.084418(50719)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50719) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"50719"}
