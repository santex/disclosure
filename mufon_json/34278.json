We had just came acroos a bridge and made a left hand turn. I saw something out of the corner of my eye and turned my head to look. Off to my left in the sky was an extremely bright white light. The color was what you would think of if someone said something was \"white hot\". It had around it a dimmer reddish light. It moved very fast and either flew or fell beyond the trees that made up the horizon. I had no idea what it could be, because I've seen aircraft of all types flying low at night. this had none of the identifying lights of a normal aircraft. I also have NEVER seen an aircraft move with that much speed. I just kept racking my brain for any ordinary explanation and couldn't come up with one. It happened in a matter of seconds. My girlfriend also saw it."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Jane Lew","There were no other sightings in Jane Lew on or around December 24th 2011"]}
