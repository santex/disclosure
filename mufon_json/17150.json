We went for a walk about 9:45-10 p.m. that evening. On the way back to our campsite through the camping area, I happened to look up through the trees and saw a very bright object moving quickly across the sky. I pointed it out to my wife and daughters, and we agreed that it was extremely bright, moving fast, and had no other aircraft navigational lights on it. There was no jet sound, either - even well after it passed from view beyond the steep ridge surrounding our camping area. I had not checked a compass earlier that day so I can't be certain as to its direction but it seemed to be moving from west-northwest to east-southeast. The thing that stands out the most was that it was very, very bright - probably two to three times as bright as the brightest star in the night sky."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Very bright star-like object traversed sky rapidly","Disposition":"IFO"}
