{"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/31/2009 09:32 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife spotted this tonight as she traveled along I-40 between Lebanon and Gainesboro Tennessee. This object appeared low on the horizon and appeared to be stationary for 5-7 minutes approximately over Carthage Tennessee. My wife couldn't discern any vertical or horizontal stabilizers, standard navigation lights or anything else that suggested it his was simply a blimp. The cylinder appeared to be thinner and more elongated than the usual form of a blimp. and didn't appear to have come to a point on either end... After traveling a short distance along I-40 (Traveling East)and trying to keep it in sight, she lost sight of it as she went down a hill.....once she emerged on the other side, the object was simply gone. We are going to watch local news for other reports of this, and acknowledge that it simply could have been an unusual blimp or something, but the event was very unusual for central Tennessee."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18989.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18989.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"18989","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.252277","Summary":"Large dark cylindrical object with sequential falshing lights on underside.","Longitude":"-85.951654","Date of the Event":"08/31/2009 07:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-08312009-0018","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.252277,+-85.951654(18989)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18989) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Carthage","There were no other sightings in Carthage on or around August 31st 2009"],"Region":"Tennessee","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Cigar","City":"Carthage","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
