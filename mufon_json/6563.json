{"divs":["Sighting Details I live in North Phoenix (32nd Street and Shea area). For the last 3 weeks I (as well as my 2 roommates) have witnessed white and red orbs flying around my home. The orbs have been seen in all directions from the house, as well as directly above the house. This last weekend the orbs were flying extremely close to the house. Saturday and Sunday I was able to capture about 20 pictures of these orbs. Pictures were taken while the camera was on a tripod. I have a strong feeling that these orbs will be back. I am planning on capturing more images and video over the next few days. I get the impression they like me taking pictures of them. That even sounds strange to me but that���s my belief. I am willing to share my photos with anyone who would like to see them. 1 - In the backyard with my dogs. 2 - The objects were close to a Southwest Airplane. 3 - A bunch of ballons. 4 - It looks like a little white orb. The orbs seperate and also huddle together. When they are together, it looks like they are battling for the center position. When this happens, it looks like a bunch of ballons tumbling through the sky. 5 - I was thrilled Sat. afternoon to get pictues of these items. I was a little shook up when the orbs were directly over my house Sunday morning. It almost seemed they were waiting for us to come outside again. 6 - I think they will be back."],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"05:00:00","Date of the Event":"03/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"33.454137","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 10th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"MULTIPLE RED AND WHITE ORB SIGHTINGS IN NORTH PHOENIX (MULTIPLE DAYS)","Case Number":"6563","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03152007-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6563.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6563_submitter_file1__DSC046072.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6563_submitter_file2__DSC04617.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6563_submitter_file3__DSC04495.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6563.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.454137,+-112.068117(6563)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6563) map </A>","Longitude":"-112.068117","City":"Phoenix","Object Features":"None","Region":"Arizona"}
