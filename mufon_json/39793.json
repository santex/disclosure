The Helicopters where Very close and I have great eye sight and for the life of me couldn't make out ANY marking on any of them. They were very normal looking Helicopters, Not unlike an older military chopper (one that a kid might draw if he was a talented artist). I can't remember ever in my life seeing 3 choppers flying in formation, I have also never seen an unmarked black helicopter, seeing 3 of them that low to the ground was really out of place for my area."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Albany","There were no other sightings in Albany on or around June 24th 2012"],"Country":"United States","City":"Albany","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/24/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 Unmarked Black (otherwise normal looking) Helicopters","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.555125,+-123.064569(39793)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39793) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Oregon","Case Number":"39793","Longitude":"-123.064569","Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-06252012-0004","Tags":"City","Latitude":"44.555125","Date Submitted":"06/25/2012 03:23 UTC"}
