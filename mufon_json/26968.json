{"Date Submitted":"12/14/2010 12:54 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsdecember 13, 2010 for past 2 days in mesa, az which today will make it the third day, i been observing this faint white and round object that seemed to just appear in the sky around 1315 hours. the object could easily be overlooked especially with sunglasses on or if you were directly in the sun. once your eyes has adjusted, the object can be seen and sometimes with no difficulties. the object from my prospective seemed to just be hovering although it is moving extremely slow. what seems always, the object would appear while looking almost southwest in direction (compass bearing 244 degrees) from power rd. and hwy 60, and between 30 to 45 degrees above the sw horizon at an altitude estimated to be about 3,000 feet (or near high air traffic route height). the object appears to be traversing west (270 degrees) from the east direction (90 degrees). and for the past two days, i been also trying to get additional picture of it using the tripod and remote. today, i managed to set my camera on the tripod, locate, and keep track of the object. i used 2 different lens: a 300mm lens 4.5g and a 500mm lens with a 2x telo-converter (1000mm) with built-in darken lens. have lots of picture of it with the 300mm unfiltered. when i used the 1000mm, the object was about 22 to 30 degrees above the horizon. the camera was set to manual mode and focus set to manual mode. i set the film speed to iso400 (because of the object dimness), pixels to raw, f-stops \"0\", and i bracket the shots between 1\\30sec to 1\\800sec in the beginning. in that way, i was guarantee at least one picture being good. in the beginning, i focused the lens by focusing on a jet near the same distant in order to locate the object. working with a set-scope can prove challenging when trying to locate a small and sometimes dim object in the far distant with a darken lens. 3\\4 of those pictures taken are salvageable; the others are white washed beyond fixing, and the darken pictures seems to show more object details and color rather than just white. tomorrow i'll be watching for it again starting at 1300 to see if it passed over me, or it just appear where i been seeing it appearing. absolutely not a jet, helicopter, or bird. possible balloon, however that's unlikely since the object was spotted at a distant of 3 to 8 miles at extreme altitude. it don't look to be a weather balloon neither since weather balloon i seen and captured on film usually has something hanging below the balloon (like it was two separate objects). the object been seen south of gilbert, southwest of mesa. no guarantees that it will repeat its pattern tomorrow, but i'll be waiting for it with my camera in hand. so far, it is still an ufo to me. the picture shown is the 1000mm."],"Longitude":"-112.070837","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Egg, Oval, Sphere","Latitude":"33.457477","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There was one other sighting in Phoenix on or around December 13th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Phoenix","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"12/13/2010 01:22 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26968.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26968_submitter_file1__Unknownobject2010-12-13_note.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26968.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:51:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.457477,+-112.070837(26968)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26968) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Round and small object sometimes dimly lit seen traversing same time and path 3 days straight, and it's not obvious until you see it but still unknown and not the usual suspect presumed to be.","Case Number":"26968","Log Number":"US-12142010-0002","Tags":"City"}
