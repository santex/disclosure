{"Country":"Venezuela","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on our stateroom deck enjoying the sea at night while heading back to New Orleans and I noticed what I thought was a meteor at first. I remember the wind was comming from the north. At first I thought it was a meteor falling from the north east going south west because of the speed but then it slowed down. I noticed that there were a few clouds but it was below the clouds and we were a few miles from the coast of Mexico. The object then traveled shortly to the south with a sharp turn. After a few seconds the object then turned sharply to the west and moved away fast. It appeared to have a blue dot at the rear section when it had moved to the west. I could not hear a sound of any sort, but it is a bit loud with the waves to hear. The approximate time was 815pm CST, after 15 minutes I went inside to see where the ship was located. For seeing my first unexplained sighting I am pretty excited to share this experience."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/23/2010 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/28/2010 09:52 UTC","Case Number":"22542","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-74.967636","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=14.540111,+-74.967636(22542)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22542) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Zulia","Log Number":"MX-03282010-0011","Summary":"Yellow Sphere in sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22542.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22542.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"14.540111","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mar Caribe","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Mar Caribe"}
