Orange corkscrew pattern disappeared and then orange light appeared then disappeared and same light appeared in a lower position in sky further than it should have been able to travel and disappeared. It moved in a pattern like an L that was slightly elongated and tilted. It repeated this pattern. Pensacola Tower and Pensacola Fire and rescue also saw and reported lights. I tried to get my cell phone camera but the corkscrew fireball had disappeared. Then I saw the lights appear and disappear and I was stunned and just stared at the sky. This was like nothing I have ever seen and I can't explain what it was or how it would be able to move so fast and far"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11142007-0013","Latitude":"30.423509","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8367.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8367.html"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"8367","City":"Pensacola","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/14/2007 05:00 UTC"}
