I pulled over to watch and noticed another vehical did the same thing as well. As I watched the hovering objects I never heard a single noise. The absence of sound and wind was very erie. Then the lights just blinked out as if someone turned off a light switch. In the past few months I have seen a diffrent glowing craft in almost the exact spot and then would just blink out, all within a half mile of the lattest sighting."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40889.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40889.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.904848,+-97.612525(40889)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40889) map </A>"}
