Thought it might be a plane since we are near an airport. so i left the backdoor and fed the cat and looked out backdoor again. light appeared to change color. It had been a clear white light now it seemed to be a red orange color on the outside and still white on the outside. It was spherical. thought maybe it was a plane coming straight at me and the color change was landing lights. But watched it for several minutes and the color kept shifting but \"plane\" never changed directions. Watched light for around 20-25 minutes and light continued to change colors and almost pulsate, but never did anything else. it never changed shape or size. couldn't find my camera and gave up and went to bed."],"Date of the Event":"11/06/2012 04:15 UTC"}
