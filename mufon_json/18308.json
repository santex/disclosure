It sounded military for sure and when they came over-head, they were so low you could see the missiles on the sides. They were Sikorsky MH-53M Pave Low Military Helicopter for sure, but I didn't get any picts. My son and daughter were out there as well as their two friends and they saw them as well. This is not a UFO sighting but I found it odd that this type of aircraft was flying over my home when the nearest airfield is about 50-75 miles east of my home. I wanted to let you know in case of any UFO sightings were in this area during the time I saw the two helicopters."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"18308","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18308.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18308.html"]}
