What we observed was a fireball type object with red center and orange exterior in the eastern sky. Object traveled in what appeared to be low Earth orbit moving from east to northeast leaving no trail as a comit would. We also have observed many ISS flyovers and this object was many times brighter, larger, and a different color, and also moved slightly faster. (note: there was no ISS flyovers scheduled to be visible from our location that night). Our location is also within aprox 100 miles of a USAF base. We have observed many fighter planes doing practice manovers and firing flares at night, and have also observed what appears to be drones during the day. The object we observed was nothing like we have ever witnessed. The object traveled in a straight path and disapeared over the northeast horizon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.069444,+-94.866389(43808)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43808) map </A>"}
