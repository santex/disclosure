I spent the 24th of March skiing in the Government Camp region, and I was carrying my camera (an old Nikkormat FT-2, if that's of any relevance) along with me and photographing the scenery and such. Upon collecting the processed film, I noticed in one of the photographs a collection of lights above the peak of Mount Hood; I do not recall observing these lights during the taking of the picture, and I would like to think that I would have noticed them had they been visible to me then. To be honest, I personally suspect some variety of film based phenomena for this one; but as the lights pictured in the photograph resemble the report (albeit a second hand report at that) from 1190 KEX, I thought it prudent to supply it to MUFON."],"City":"Timberline Lodge, Mount H","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-121.711465"}
