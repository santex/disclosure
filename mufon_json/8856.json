{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhen I was 10 years old, I was waiting outside our house to be picked up to go to tap class, and while waiting, went down into our avocado grove. I was standing about 3 tiers down, looking out across the gully, when I saw what I thought was a wing from an airplane falling from the sky. It was silver and shaped like a wedge - flat on top and curved underneath. I realized instantly that it couldn't be a wing as it was falling too slowly, as if it were controlled. It looked like it was settling in water and it shimmered as it descended. I thought it must be some kind of remote controlled aircraft and wondered if it belonged to the neighbors across the gully. Suddenly, when it was around three to five feet from the ground, it shot sideways at an incredible speed and disappeared. I remembered grabbing hold of the tree next to me and wondering what the heck I had just seen. I then remember feeling confused and disoriented. I heard the dance bus honking for me in the driveway and I ran up out of the avocado grove and caught the bus just as it was pulling away. The driver was mad and asked where I had been and that they had been waiting for me for awhile. I was confused and wondered why I hadn't heard them drive in. As I got into the bus I felt a pinching sensation in my leg. I looked down and saw a sizable hole in my shin. I thought, \"Oh no, this is bad! I need to tell the driver to stop.\" I was about to ask him to let me out but when I looked at the hole closer, I could see that it wasn't bleeding. There was absolutely no blood. I remember thinking it was strange and I had no idea how it had occurred. I didn't tell anyone about the sighting or the injury until years later."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around March 31st 1968"],"Date of the Event":"03/31/1968 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"34.059134","Date Submitted":"03/31/1968 12:00 UTC","City":"Los Angeles","Log Number":"US-01152008-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.059134,+-118.234175(8856)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8856) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Longitude":"-118.234175","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"California","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8856.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO sighting followed by loss of time and injury","Case Number":"8856"}
