Now we both know U.F.O.'s exsist but this is something on a whole new level for the both of us. We are still trying to process this. But here it is. I had aimed the scope at the moon to have a big object to see and bumped the telescope slightly and that is when it happened, I peered through the view finder, the moon was just out of sight and I could see lights or like a type of pulsating glow as I focused on it more, I was in shock it was the best way to say it a damm train in space! There was a type of lead vessel pulling 15 to 18 other vessel like containers each with a sort of pulsating glow from the bottom of each one after my Wife saw them to we couldn't even believe it, tried to explain it rationaly like maybe a reflection of something close by us but nothing would cause what we saw. I now think and I hate to say it but really believe there is a base on the moon being supplied right now."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35054.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35054.html"],"Log Number":"US-01222012-0009","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/22/2012 02:07 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Nevada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"35054","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
