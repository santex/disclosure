This was on the coast of Maine. Theres noting around us but ocean and woods. At around 7pm we saw was seemed to be a large sphere of intense light it was about 3-5 miles out in the ocean. i myself passed it off as a boat at the time. in about 15 minutes the light disappeared. at 11:00pm we were sitting around our came fire when one my friends pointed out a light in the distance again i just put off as a boat as i\"m kinda a skeptic to UFO's but as this time it came closer and closer to the point when our camp sight went from dark to completely illuminated. as it hover directly to the cliff edge about 20-30 ft away from us. it came out to be sphere shaped emiting a strong white light with red and green lights around it's edges. but as close it was it was completely silent. we ran all the way be to our car 5 miles away from camp through dark woods. as soon we left we were followed for about 3 miles by a strange black car that was just tailgating us im not sure if this links to the strange light's but we have camped here before and have never seen anyone out here until this night so its all just very odd. i just dont know who to tell so i came here as i have never been to strong of a ufo believer well until now. Im just freaked out.. (i have a video that will be posted soon of the 7pm sphere)"],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"intense bright mezmerizing sphere.","Date of the Event":"05/19/2012 11:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/21/2012 12:21 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.19239,+-76.062424(38334)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38334) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38334.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38334.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
