{"Object Shape":"Sphere","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went to my back yard to let my dog out. I looked up towards the north-eastern sky and something that was silver that caught my eye. I thought this might've been a jet airliner and looked away. My dog was barking at the same object so I looked again and realized that is a sphere and not a commercial jet aircraft. After seeing this again, I realized that there two more spheres , also in a silver color, which seemed to have orbited around the first sphere I saw. After witnessing this for a few minutes, the objects went up into the sky where I lost sight of them."],"Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/13/2008 04:30 UTC","Case Number":"18347","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18347.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18347.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/13/2008 04:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.621873","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.63144,+-81.621873(18347)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18347) map </A>","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Lehigh Acres","There were no other sightings in Lehigh Acres on or around August 13th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"a silver colored sphere","Latitude":"26.63144","City":"Lehigh Acres","Log Number":"US-07272009-0011","Object Features":"None"}
