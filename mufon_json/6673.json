{"Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWife and I witness the light hover for over 30min. I saw it first and dismissed it as a star, so I sat and watched TV for about 30min. I glanced outside my kitchen window and the light was brighter. I called the wife to witness it and used binoculars to verify the lights and it was not a star but was flashing bright small red light with large bright lights below the red light but had no lights below the object. While watching it with binoculars the light turned off and it was gone? The light just turned off and the object was gone without a trace. I kept looking for it with the binoculars but did not see anything. We witnessed it from Yoder Colorado looking west toward the north end of Colorado Springs."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Latitude":"38.838602","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There were no other sightings in Colorado Springs on or around March 27th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Colorado Springs","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"03/27/2007 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-03282007-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.838602,+-104.813743(6673)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6673) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6673.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6673.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"UFO disappeared while starring at it with binoculars and wife looking at it during the night.","Date of the Event":"03/27/2007 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-104.813743","Case Number":"6673"}
