{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAn object was seen following about 8 degrees behind the station on its pass at this time. It was about magnitude 3.5. This followed by two minutes sighting of object overhead heading NW. When northwest of us and at 25 degrees altitude as seen from here, this first object made very sharp turn to south towards area where station passed. It was then lost behind a tree.
