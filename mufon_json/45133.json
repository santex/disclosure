It was moving really fast and based on the height of the clouds, and the fact that it had no wings, it was bigger than a plane, therefore not a plane. It was moving towards Disney (our store is 4 miles north of disney) at a very fast speed with no sound. it was round, metallic, and reflected the sun like it was covered in chrome."],"Date Submitted":"01/10/2013 08:17 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Windermere","There were no other sightings in Windermere on or around January 9th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"45133","Log Number":"US-01102013-0012","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45133.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.446066","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.446066,+-81.557808(45133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45133) map </A>"}
