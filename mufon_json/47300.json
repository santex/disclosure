I have kept them and have wondered if it is just dust reflection on the lens of the camera or something else. #1 & 2 pics have BAL. #3 has orange light and I think that is a house light across the street from picture location. #4 has BAL in the sky. I was at this location the other day and checked to see if there are any light towers or anything that would have caused the BAL in #4 pic; there is not. Just thought you may like to see. I have been a member of MUFON for many years. OK to contact if you need or want any more information. I have never shown these images to the people that are in the pictures. Thanks, Wade"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mt. Storm","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
