About 2 minutes went by and looked back up and the second \"star\" was moving slowly across the sky. I ran for my Android phone and recorded it as it moved from the west towards the east. The attached video is sideways and not the best of quality because it is on my phone, but if you turn it to the right, you may be able to view it better. You will see the actual star just sitting still and the \"Unidentified flying object\" moving slowly away. There are no flashing lights or sound. The sounds in the background are children in my neighborhood playing with fireworks as it is New years eve. It just slowly continued until no longer seen towards the South East past the tree line where I live. I live near an airport and this was no plane."],"Case Number":"44868","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.010023,+-82.153663(44868)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44868) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-82.153663","Latitude":"28.010023","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/31/2012 06:39 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Plant City","There were no other sightings in Plant City on or around December 31st 2012"],"City":"Plant City"}
