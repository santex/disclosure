We drove toward it on our way home but the sporadic display of aerial lights floated away in a Northeast direction. Once we got to the city, we lost sight of the craft but saw it reappear hovering just Northeast of Fresno, hovering over the ridge of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It didn't make a sound and continued to pulsate erratically. We used our digital camera but the sky was too dark and the craft was too distant. At least ten individuals simultaneously witnessed this phenomenon. The craft was about the size of two football fields when fully lit but could morph into a third of its size at will. We watched in shock and amazement. We braved the cold until 1AM, watching it hover and change its light pattern."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Fresno","There were no other sightings in Fresno on or around March 6th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Hovering craft with bright lights over Fresno 3/6/2012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36300.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36300.html"],"Log Number":"US-03072012-0005"}
