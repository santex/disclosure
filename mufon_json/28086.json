{"divs":["sighting detailsi was getting a ride to work from my mother. it was sunny out, almost no clouds at all. while driving down courthouse road (approaching jefferson davis highway) i noticed the glint of a metallic object in the sky, north of us and travelling in the same direction at between (about)18,000ft and (about)27,000ft altitude. i always try to identify any plane\\helicopter i see, that being said, i focused on the object, thats when i noticed it didn't seem to have any wings. i thought \"maybe it's a commercial plane banking in this direction.\" except there was no tail to the craft, so i was quite puzzled. after approximatley 20 seconds of watching the craft it suddenly stopped completely (my jaw dropped), thinking it was my eyes\\brain creating an illusion of it stopping because the car had stopped at a light or something, i looked around only to find out that was not the case and that we were still cruising along. i then resumed watching the object\\craft and it continued to hover for 3 to 5 seconds, at which time it doubled back on its previous course at two to three times the speed while ascending at a (visually at least) 5 degree climb. i kept watching it until the roof of the car blocked my line of sight. i was absolutley estatic about seeing what i had, so started watching the sky very closely and saw a formation of two chinook helicopters approaching from the south at a maximum of 1500ft alt. (not 15,000-i repeat 1500ft). when they got probably a football field and a half away from us, the two helicopter made a hard bank left in the direction that the object went i suspect they had just been told to try and tail the object due to them being in the area already (possibly while en route to quantico)."],"Latitude":"38.312304","Date of the Event":"09/21/2010 10:00 UTC","Summary":"Object moving west/northwest came to full stop and accelerated in opposite direction","Source":"MUFON","City":"Fredericksburg","Longitude":"-77.45603","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28086.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28086.html"],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Light, Does Not Apply","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Fredericksburg","There were no other sightings in Fredericksburg on or around September 21st 2010"],"Case Number":"28086","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Virginia","Sighting Duration":"00:00:33","Date Submitted":"03/04/2011 04:08 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.312304,+-77.45603(28086)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28086) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03042011-0009","Object Features":"None"}
