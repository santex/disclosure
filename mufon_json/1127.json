Within an hour of sunset, a largethunderhead was forming West of town that stretched high into the sky, blockingthe sun. There was what seemed like a very unnatural light everywhere from theclouds blocking the sun, but the light refracted around the cloud creating thiseffect. Suddenly I saw what appeared to be a cylindrical object, opaque incolor floating a mile or so away. It was very large and tilted at an angle ofapproximately 60 degrees. The object traveled NxNE very slowly and at the exactelevation the entire time. I could see definition of shape, but could seethrough the object barely, almost like tinted glass. The sun dipped furtherbehind the clouds, the light changed and the object disappeared. I tracked theobject from directly in front of my car to almost perpendicular to the vehiclespassenger window. I tried to wake my son to show him but he did not awaken intime."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Georgetown","There were no other sightings in Georgetown on or around December 27th 1998"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.636734,+-97.669831(1127)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1127) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Summary":"flying object, opaque coloration, large size, unk"}
