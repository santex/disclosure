P.S. this ain't all (2 more)."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.176392","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.176392,+-97.175048(31159)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31159) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Nebraska","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Summary":"car died ufo went down behind hill. reappeared later. tried to communicate","Log Number":"US-08252011-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31159.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Winside","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
