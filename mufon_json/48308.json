I saw a silver, spherical, disk flying where planes fly. If was going in a straight path, heading northeast, for about 3 seconds, and simply disappeared. It looked like it just turned invisible. I was the only one who had seen it. My mom was also in the car with me. It was a bright, clear, day without a cloud in the sky. I was shocked after I saw this because I am an alien fanatic and first assumed it was a U.F.O. I believe it actually may have been."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.349553"}
