I usually look up at the stars while walking outside at night. At first I thought it might just be a plane until I noticed the strange behaviour of its lights. I considered using my phone to film it but I figured that my phone camera was not good enough to see anything. I came back in my apartment to look up aircraft lights before I reported it as a UFO. I lost sight of it by coming back indoors to ask my family about it."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52138.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52138.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Strange flashing lights moving across the sky.","Date Submitted":"11/09/2013 08:28 UTC","City":"Norman","Date of the Event":"11/09/2013 07:00 UTC"}
