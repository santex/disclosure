I'm from downunder. Listen to this story MUFON.com. I was out boxing a kangaroo when I saw some lights approaching. I looked up then down again and saw that was in the air. I punched one of the lights in the face then it let me go. My trusty kangaroo caught me and I bounced away with him. It was crazy mate. I think the lights were actually just my parents with flashlights and th trampoline would account for bouncing, but I don't care."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7098.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7098.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.807187,+144.97253(7098)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7098) map </A>","Summary":"It was freaking crazy!
