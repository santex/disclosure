Looking closely and slightly West you will see a road or trail that runs South for miles. It even follows the contours of the terrain. I located it last night and posted a video to youtube. I have alerted KRON news desk too. There are many other strange anomalies I have found today, including trails to the south and west of the Apollo 15 site.
