It travelled steadily south and made no noticeable noise. There were no visible marker lights and it appeared to be a thimble shaped object emitting an afterburner-like flame straight down from the bottom. It travelled south and slowly disappeared. My young daught was the first to mention that it was a UFO. We were all awestruck and could not explain what it was. I grew up near an airbase and have seen all types of military aircraft.
