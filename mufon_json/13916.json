I had my uncle come outside and witness this object (both my uncle and myself are former military members). We both watched the object move slowly to our relative right then it then moved to the the left we noticed three to four afterburner like lights from this object and the alignment was strait so I can only say that the object was rectangular from the aft porttion. I had my wife come out and she also seen the object and about the same time the local police crusier was coming down the street and I stopped him and asked him if there had been any strange reports and he said that there were none; I then told him why I had stopped him and he then got out of the vehicle. At this time all four of us seen the object turn up and then climb towards the atmosphere and within a few short seconds the object was no longer visable."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13916.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13916.html"],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.949526,+-94.423548(13916)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13916) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11232008-0013","Region":"Arkansas","Latitude":"35.949526","City":"Lincoln","Date Submitted":"11/19/2008 08:20 UTC","Longitude":"-94.423548","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"13916","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lincoln","There were no other sightings in Lincoln on or around November 19th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON"}
