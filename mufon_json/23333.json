I didn't know that in several photos a green light appeared until I watched them late at night. This light appears in the same point but in different positions; it is green and oval. I didn't feel anything because I didn't see it at the exact moment but it isn't the first time this happens to me. Two years ago, I took a photo to the sky and immediately something reflected in the sky. When I checked the photo there was a white oval light on it. I lost this photo but that is the reason I want to know what is this and i hope you can give an answer. Thank you."],"City":"Envigado","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"23333","Region":"Antioquia","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
