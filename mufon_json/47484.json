Could of been a blimp, just didn't see anywhere pilot sat. no under charidge, it was a solid shape. no markings on it, and was huge. It was moving slowly. It was illuminated from within. It was very clear, no markings, but had a textured skin, like scales, thats why i thought i was a blimp of some type. though how it was driven there was nothing underneath just the blinking red light. I took photo with iphone. I will post three images. original, a blown up image and a original with increased explored to show size and location."]}
