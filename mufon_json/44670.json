I was looking at Christmas lights with my husband and children in a quiet neighborhood. We were the only car on the road. 2. I was looking at this particular house when I saw lights above it. 3. At first, I thought it was a water tower or something. 4. But then I saw clearly a triangular shaped ship and it was hovering over this home about 100-200 feet in the sky. I had my window down and it was silent. It took off down the highway and then we lost it. It was extremely fast, already halfway across the sky in less than a minute. It had a green light and blue light, I don't remember if it was two or three lights. Definitely triangle shaped, I could see it clearly. 5. I was in shock, I was upset I wasn't able to follow it either. 6. We lost it on the highway, I think it stopped somewhere to hover over something."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44670.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44670.html"],"Object Features":"Wings","Case Number":"44670","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.643738,+-98.495223(44670)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44670) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/19/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-98.495223","Country":"United States"}
