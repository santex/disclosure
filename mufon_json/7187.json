Twice before I have reported seeing an object(s) (4-29-07 and 5-27-07) and photos were posted (5-27-07). This time I think I hit the jackpot!!! While looking out over the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Boca Raton, not only did I see a similar object (just like I reported before) but, numerous objects!!! Some white, some red and some dark! The time I saw these objects was between 3p.m. and 4:30p.m. and not just localized in one area but, a wide area over the Atlantic! Using my Kodak Z740 Digital Camera, I took numerous photos and will post the pictures soon. Something is going on out there and it's kinda thrilling!!! This is blowing my mind! While some of the objects were stationary, some were also moving near each other!!!"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Somethings going on over the Atlantic Ocean!!!","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Boca Raton","There were no other sightings in Boca Raton on or around June 9th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.367548,+-80.073498(7187)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7187) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/09/2007 12:00 UTC","Region":"Florida","City":"Boca Raton","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-06092007-0004","Longitude":"-80.073498","Case Number":"7187"}
