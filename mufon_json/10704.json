{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI didn't see anything but the helicopters. I just wanted to look at the helicopters up close. Later that night I thought I'd look at them on the computer and saw the dots and wondered what they were. One of the dots looked very interesting, I've seen that one on the TV before. That���s when I think I figured out what they could be. I was looking to the west at the time I took the pixs. I was working in the back yard and I could hear the helicopters coming and wanted to see them up close so I ran into the house and grabbed my camera a Canon Power Shot S2 1S 5.0 mega pixels. I think for the first time I may have caught something interesting."],"Log Number":"US-05082008-0014","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Took three pix of military helicopters as they came over.
