When at 9.32pm we saw this bright green fireball in the sky. We noticed the object at about an elevation of about 85 degrees, and it continued until it passed the horizon. If it was a meteor, we never heard any crash and we didn't see anything on the news about it today. Also, the magnitude (brightness) of the object never wavered. We are long time astronomy fans, and we have seen many meteors. At the same time, we've never seen a green meteor (made of copper?) We were also both were surprised about how slow the object seemed to move. I'd compare it to the speed of a single engine prop plane, at an altitude of 1000-1500 feet up. The object was about the size of a pencil eraser at a arms length. I made a little diagram of what we saw...the dotted green line represent the path of the object."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in Jacksonville","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville on or around March 30th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"03/31/2010 01:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22579.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22579_submitter_file1__March30th2010.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22579.html"]}
