It had been sprinkling rain on and off through out the day, there was complete cloud cover. I was in a coffee shop drive through. When directly in front of my truck about 200 yards out, right under the cloud cover something caught my eye. It was a dark black dome shaped hovering object just below the clouds. It was just enough under the clouds to be fully exposed. It looked to be the size of a large SUV, & about 8 Feet tall at the peak of its hight. I asked the coffee girl to take a look. We were both stunned. We had no idea what we were looking at, I have never seen any thing like this. It made no noise that we could hear, and there were no lights to speak of. I'm not sure how long it was there before i saw it. But about 15 seconds after i first saw it, it very slowly went up in to the clouds. I was kind of scared cause i've never seen anything like this. But i saw the Mutual UFO Network on the history channel and thought maybe someone could explaine what we saw that afternoon."],"Date of the Event":"03/16/2008 02:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"9987","Region":"Oregon","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States"}
