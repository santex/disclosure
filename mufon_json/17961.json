The object was moving from West to East at a steady speed fast but not that fast that i did not have time to observe it for about 25 seconds before it went out of sight.The object was completely silent and just seemed to glide across the night sky.10 minutes earlier i was observing a police helicopter in the same area and was extremly noisy and appeared to be at simialr height to the UFO i had observed, so i know that this UFO was not commercial or private air traffic from the eerie silence as it approached and departed the area.I am really annoyed that i did not have my camcorder to hand at the time because this is twice now in 2 days that i have seen strange silent objects pass and i just hope i get another opportunity to witness these objects again but i will be prepared."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Wales","Date of the Event":"07/08/2009 11:55 UTC","Log Number":"GB-07082009-0033","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Cardiff","There was one other sighting in Cardiff on or around July 8th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.489681,+-3.17119(17961)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17961) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/08/2009 11:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"51.489681","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Saw a bright light object orange lights looked like 3 i think it was triangular","Case Number":"17961","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
