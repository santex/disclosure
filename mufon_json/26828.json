I was startled by the bright light in the sky with a prism of light going through it. I was called by a friend to ask if I was in the area and what direction to look. He stated that he had been looking at it for approximately an hour and couldn't figure out what it was. When I first saw it I thought it was the sun and then gasped out loud when I realized the sun was to the left of the object. It was quite a bit smaller than the sun, but at first glance I thought it was the sun because it was that bright."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","City":"Burbank","Date Submitted":"12/02/2010 07:20 UTC","Case Number":"26828","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Diamond","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City"}
