It was bright white at this time. I watched it for a few minutes and it started changing colors from white, yellow,blue,red, and green.The lights were changing really fast. And the light was staying in the same place the whole time. I woke up my girlfriend to show her and she saw it to. I pulled out binoculars to look at it and it looked like a big bright ball changing colors rapidly. You could really make out the colors. So I watched it for about an hour and it didn't move and was still changing colors. I dont know what it was, but it was still in the same spot and changing colors in the sky when I decided to go to bed."],"City":"Madeline Island","Region":"Wisconsin","Date of the Event":"10/07/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Lights in sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19864.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19864.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.813517","Tags":"City","Case Number":"19864","Date Submitted":"10/08/2009 02:40 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Madeline Island","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
