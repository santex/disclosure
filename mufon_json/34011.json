Trying to remember exactly where, jus know its where the road starts descending and Pikes peak is visible. its around 6:45am coulda been 6:46 or 47. Doin my usual while driving and scanning the skies when east of Pikes Peak a dull off white light appears, not to bright drops down a bit and then proceeds in a westerly direction for one second. In my best guess it traveled 30-50 miles in a second and then lost sight of it. From my view point I could see the whole area. All I saw was a light, too far,too fast. I couldn't tell if it flew over Pikes Peak or if it was in the area like Castle Rock area."],"Date of the Event":"12/13/2011 06:45 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"12/13/2011 09:09 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"39.638756","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34011.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34011.html"],"Log Number":"US-12132011-0014","Source":"MUFON","City":"Lakewood"}
