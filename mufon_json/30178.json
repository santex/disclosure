As we observed the blue light we noticed that it was doing some bizarre manuvers such as tight circling and dip down and up for a couple minutes. Then the light disapeared in the distance behind a building. Several minutes later the light came up from behind the building at a distance and started the same manuvoers but seemed to flicker out. Because of our relative proximity to Chicago Midway Airport there was aircraft flying north behind the light at that moment. Again the light dipped behind the building. Several minutes later the light which was red, was up and coming toward our position. The moon light was illuminating the clouds as it was flying above us. As it flew in a straight line going southwest we could not detect a shape or navigation lights normally associated with aircaft at night. Furthermore, with the amount of moon light we could not see a sihlloet of anything other then a orb of light. The light past over heads seeming to go thru the cloulds but them disapearred. There was broken clould cover because a jet that was flying out of Midway was passing in and out of clouds a couple minutes later."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Alsip","Date Submitted":"07/15/2011 01:06 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Alsip","There were no other sightings in Alsip on or around July 14th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/14/2011 10:45 UTC","Longitude":"-87.735782","Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"30178","Latitude":"41.674692","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
