I felt like looking at the stars. I noticed a pair of lights flying in the same direction. They where spaced with a great deal of distance between them. They changed elevation and flew up near where the clouds would start. They then changed direction just before going out of my line of sight. I know what a airplane looks like at night and other military aircraft to. This what not any of these. I felt weird and wanted to keep looking at it. It was really neat, i didn't feel scared at all."],"Case Number":"50966","Latitude":"40.275074","Sighting Duration":"00:05:30","Summary":"There were two lights flying in a like banking pattern and continued on.","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50966.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50966.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.131942","Date of the Event":"09/21/2013 08:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-09212013-0018","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.275074,+-86.131942(50966)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50966) map </A>","Region":"Indiana"}
