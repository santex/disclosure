First, I was thinking about a plane (I saw a lot around there, because of Logan Intl Airport & Hanscom AFB) , or something like that, but there was no sound, and the light weren't flashing. So I took a picture. When I look at the pictures on the computer, I remarked that I didn't saw anything like that before. I thank about a B-2 Spirit or a F-117."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/12/2012 10:03 UTC","Latitude":"42.372402","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.372402,+-71.19036(42180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42180) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-71.19036","Log Number":"US-08312012-0019","Date Submitted":"08/31/2012 07:46 UTC","Case Number":"42180","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Watertown","There were no other sightings in Watertown on or around July 12th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42180.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I saw a triangle on the sky"}
