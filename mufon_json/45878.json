They were flying slowly in an odd formation. The lights were larger than aircraft lights. They also did not have the same color as airplane lights. The sighting occurred in Murfreesboro,TN at approximately 6:55pm on a clear cloudless night on Feb. 24th 2013. Other cars in the area seemed to slow down and observe the lights as well. They were totally silent as I lowered my car window to make certain they were not known aircraft. I observed them in awe as they looked strange with no blinking directional light and totally silent. They went from four light to three to two and finally I saw the last one slowly fade like on a dimmer switch. I actually followed the direction they were flying in the event they became visible again but I never saw them after a short detour on my way home to find them. I am reporting this in case others do the same and confirm my sighting."],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-02242013-0027","Case Number":"45878","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"02/24/2013 08:59 UTC","City":"Murfreesboro","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"35.87262","Longitude":"-86.47362","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45878.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45878.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.87262,+-86.47362(45878)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45878) map </A>","Summary":"Four bright steady amber lightsi Pea size odd formation-faded out one at a time."}
