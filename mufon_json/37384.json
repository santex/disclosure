{"Log Number":"US-04112012-0020","Tags":"City","Case Number":"37384","divs":["Sighting DetailsShortly after leaving my home for an early morning jog, I came across a very unusual object that hovered silently over a residential area and projected a bright white beam. The object was rectangular in shape and nearly all black on the surface. There were no colors or distinct markings. I stopped jogging for a moment, although I had only run less than ��� mile (I run marathons), to observe the object while it remained in place for what seemed to be several minutes. I felt the need to continue with my jog, and simultaneously the object began to move away as well. An eerie feeling must have come over me because my thoughts have been distorted since that day. But I feel an obligation to report what I saw, and so I have done my best to recreate the picture in my mind. Attached is a drawing that depicts this moment to the best of my recollection."],"trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Rancho Cordova","There were no other sightings in Rancho Cordova on or around June 15th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"A clear view of a large rectangular vehicle hovering with bright spotlight.","Date Submitted":"04/11/2012 04:52 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Rancho Cordova","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-121.296948","Latitude":"38.597982","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37384.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37384.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/15/2008 05:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.597982,+-121.296948(37384)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37384) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
