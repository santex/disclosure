She was yelling that there was a UFO in the sky. I went outside and immediately spotted the UFO. It was flying across the sky very fast, much faster than any plane. It appeared to be hovering and would even move vertical. It changed directions several times and disappeared behind some tress for a moment. It also had blinking lights that were all different colors (violet, pink, green, and blue). Then it was suddenly gone and we didn't see it anymore. We have checked the sky in the same place the last few nights and have not seen anything."],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/08/2012 03:03 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/04/2012 09:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38974.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38974.html"]}
