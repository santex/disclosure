{"Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking outside and just happened to look up at the moon toward the west and saw a very dark object with a cylinder shape overall. At first I thought it might be some balloons in the sky, but they did not bob and weave like balloons I've watched float away. It sat still for about 3-4 minutes, then began moving very slowly to the south. It had no lights, and as it very slowly moved it seemed to also be moving up and away so that it became smaller and smaller. I was franticly trying to get my digital camera to work, but the batteries were dead, and everytime I looked down at it, I could barely find the object again against the darkening sky. Finally it just drift completely out of sight."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06182007-0011","Date of the Event":"06/18/2007 09:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.587733,+-101.853086(7246)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7246) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/18/2007 09:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7246.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7246.html"],"Case Number":"7246","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Longitude":"-101.853086","Latitude":"33.587733","Summary":"Cylinder shaped object stationary then moving slowly away and out of sight","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Lubbock","There were no other sightings in Lubbock on or around June 18th 2007"],"City":"Lubbock","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown"}
