They looked like effects of chemtrails with some areas having a \"oil\" sheen affect on them. I took perhaps 20 pictures and downloaded them to the computer. I slightly balanced levels on the photo and they were easily visible, though without the balancing they were more difficult to make out, though easily seen. I did not notice them while taking the pictures."],"Date Submitted":"11/18/2007 02:30 UTC"}
