As Soon As I Closed My Eyes I open them and find this blinking light. I Thought It was a plane. I Look For A Second And See This Is Not A Regular Plane. I Looked Closely And Saw It Looked Like A C With A Divide in The Middle Like a Stencil C Like The Font. It was A bright Red. I Ran Out of The Back Door To See it better. It Had A little tail.
