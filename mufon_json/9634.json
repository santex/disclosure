We were watching the embers in the smoke trail when we noticed the objects going overhead. We couldn't tell what it was, as with two of them following the same path, it was rather odd. The one in the front was not as bright as the one traveling in the rear. They went directly over our home and may have been a few miles high up in the sky. My 17 yr old son took out his camera phone and got a picture of the larger one. We lost track of them in the southern sky after that. We heard no plane engines(sounds) nor did we see any flashing lights."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
