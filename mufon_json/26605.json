{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI walked outside the office at work to smoke. I lit a cigerette I looked up at the sky and saw a glowing wedge shape object about 500ft. above the tree line. I watched for a few minutes not sure what the object was doing. The wedge seemed to be lit from the inside, but had a metalic shimmer to it. After aprox. 6 minutes, the object made a clockwise turn, very slow, Northeast and slowly vanished into the darkness. A cold chill went through my body. I was very upset and went to seek medical attention."],"Latitude":"34.190362","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"26605","Date Submitted":"11/16/2010 01:23 UTC","City":"Flowery Branch","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26605.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Region":"Georgia","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cone","Country":"United States","Summary":"It was a glowing wedge shaped object.","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.190362,+-83.924171(26605)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26605) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11162010-0003","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Flowery Branch","There were no other sightings in Flowery Branch on or around September 24th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"09/24/2010 09:17 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-83.924171"}
