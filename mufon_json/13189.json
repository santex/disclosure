As I followed it, it was moving very fast across the sky, it was not an airplane,It was low enough that I could see it was not. Very bright silver, no lights visable. As i followed it all of a sudden as it moved for only 25 or 30 seconds in the sky, it was gone just as fast as it appeared. It did not change any directions, just a straight line from North to Southwest and then gone. No clouds for it to go into. As i drove I kept looking into the same direction to see if it would appear again possibly further in the sky but it did not reappear. What made me notice the object was that it was very bright. Caught my eyes. My heart pounded very quickly once I realized it was not an airplane."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13189.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13189.html"],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-88.303274","Latitude":"41.852838","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
