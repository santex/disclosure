It was a solid orb and did not flutter or blink like a plane or a star, It looked like Jupiter in the night sky. I live by the MCI Airport in Kansas City and see planes every day. The object was traveling much faster then a commercial plane. It proceeded to move across the sky and behind some clouds. It then appeared behind the clouds and changed direction ascending in to the night sky until we lost track of it. We both knew this was not an ordinary Airplane and came to the conclusion that it must be some sort of anti gravity ship, either Gov or Alien."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/13/2011 07:01 UTC","City":"Kansas City","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around August 13th 2011"]}
