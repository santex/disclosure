I was waiting at the traffic light at Brookhaven Road and RT 352. I saw what I thought was an airplane but it was reflecting the sunlight brilliantly. It looked cylindrical and closely resembled an airplane, but do to the reflection, I coudnt make out exact geometric shapes i.e. I dont know if it had wings. I observed this very quickly. I looked down at my cell phone for a about 1-2 seconds and when I looked up, the object was gone. There were some clouds in the sky, but not to the extent that I would describe the sky as \"partly cloudy.\" The object was below the clouds when I first observed it moving east to west. It did not disappear into the clouds. It just simply vanished. I scanned the sky sweeping as far as to the west that I could - and the object wasgone"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Brookhaven","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-75.382414","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I saw a slow moving silver object moving east to west and then it vanished.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"39.869279","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11052013-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.869279,+-75.382414(52060)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52060) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Brookhaven","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52060.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52060.html"]}
