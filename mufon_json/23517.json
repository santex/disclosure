It was heading northwest in a leisurely manner. From our perspective, it seemed to have an uneven rate of acceleration. We watched it for about a minute and half before it looked as if it were getting smaller (or more distant) and then it disappeared from sight. We had never seen anything like it before and wondered it was a meteorite���although it didn���t seem like it was falling."],"Date of the Event":"05/29/2010 09:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Region":"Florida","City":"Sarasota","Tags":"City"}
