I see this bright intense light. I know for a fact it can't be a plane or helicopter because of the location.. I'm filming the bright light when it just disappears. 10 min later, another ball or light glides into view and then simply disappears.. Very odd. This night was very intense with air traffic and weird activity.. It did not duck behind a building.. The only building in site is that tall condo building and it vanishes before it passes by it... Another person downtown also caught the odd light on film vanishing... 120109 NYC v456"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.724063","Summary":"Odd light vanishes into thin air over NYC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.724063,+-74.004773(20846)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20846) map </A>","Case Number":"20846"}
