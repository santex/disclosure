My wife and I both looked up and we all saw about 15 orange, glowing lights. Most were in a triangular formation, headed in a northeasterly direction. The sky was very cloudy and dark, as it had been storming earlier. We watched them for approximatley 5 minutes; they were moving very slowly. They disappeared into the clouds. We know these could not have been ordinary aircraft, as they were grouped closely together. The other people were as confused as we were. The lady said she thought she was seeing things at first. They were going down Decker Road when they first saw them. They then turned at our corner, which is about a quarter mile from Decker Rd. We all watched in disbelief until the lights faded into the clouds."],"Case Number":"31054","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
