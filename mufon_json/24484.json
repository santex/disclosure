This time it was hovering in one spot, then dropping altitude in arc type motion, then irratically flying back up again, this was no balloon, lantern, helicopter or airplain. I don't know if these are military or extraterrestrial, but it seems to me, they want to know about us and going to great lengths to make us little folks in Harrisburg aware that they are here.
