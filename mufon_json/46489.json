I stopped my car to observe this object, which had a solid red light flyingh slow me. Now there was only one light (unlike a plane, which has blinking lights.) I also noticed that this object was cone shaped (It blocked out a few stars, that is how I seen a shape.) This object seemed to move toward New York City, so I got in my car, went up Grace to Leonard St to Central Avenue to Palisdae Street to Hoboken to follow this object. I lost it on 14st street. It seemed to disappear over the Hudson River."],"Region":"New Jersey","Date of the Event":"03/30/2013 01:39 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.752975,+-74.045019(46489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46489) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46489.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46489.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/30/2013 02:45 UTC"}
