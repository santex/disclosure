{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"16873","City":"Sheffield","Date of the Event":"05/09/2009 10:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["sighting detailsit was about 10:30 pm on saturday, 9th may and i was getting ready to go to bed. so i was coming up to my room, which is in the attic. i have some sky light windows, and one of the blinds was open. i normally look out the window, and i literally looked up and there were at least 10 bright orange\\white lights..moving in the same direction (from west to east) coming over my house. i'd never seen anything like this and it really did quite frighten me. straight away i knew this was definitely not right or normal. i knew they were not aircraft (well at least not conventional aircraft). i just quickly grabbed my camera phone in an attempt to prove to people what i was witnessing. i then opened my window and proceeded to record the lights. i could see more of them coming up from behind the trees in the distance, and all following the same path. i noticed other people walking on the street, who were also witnessing what i was seeing. i started to shout across the street to them and they were as confused and amazed as i was. the lights just kept coming from over the distance and i was pretty concerned as to when or if they were going to stop. as soon as some disappeared, more would re-appear and keep coming over in the same direction. it looked as if they were following one another. they were making no noise, i could hear no aircraft noise and they were moving at a constant speed, but not too fast. i live on a busy main road, and people in their cars were stopping and pulling over to get out and watch them too. about 4 cars stopped along with some other pedestrians and people from the pub across the street. we all witnessed them for about 10 minutes, and more just kept coming. as i saw them heading over the top of my house, i rushed to the back window, which looks out over the city centre. i saw some of the lights moving into each other and then they would just disappear slowly. this happened for at least 15 minutes. the sky was pretty clear, i could see the moon in the south and i could also see stars, but these were definitely not stars. a couple of minutes after all of them had gone, i saw an airplane of some sort flying over in a non conventional flight plan in the direction of the city centre. as i am aware of where the flight paths are for commercial airlines and this plane was pretty low, my thought is maybe it was military. i'm have never seen lights like these, but they did seem to be glowing exceptionally bright and i noticed they were kind of flashing in an orbital fashion. we are quite near the peak district, and i thought maybe it was military, but i don't understand why they would do such an exercise over such a big city, quite early at night when people are bound to see. i'm not sure if they were alien, but at first it certainly scared me, as this wasn't your average light in the sky. on another note, i have witnessed similar bright white orange lights from my window in the attic that seemed to move across, hover, then just simply disappear. this was about a few months prior to the sighting i had on the 9th of may. another person i know has also witnessed strange glowing hovering lights in the same area. it's all very strange."],"Region":"England","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.382839,+-1.461485(16873)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16873) map </A>","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Sheffield","There were no other sightings in Sheffield on or around May 9th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/09/2009 10:45 UTC","Longitude":"-1.461485","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Latitude":"53.382839","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16873_submitter_file1__Picture28.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16873_submitter_file2__screenshotd.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16873.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United Kingdom","Summary":"Around 50 bright orange/white lights hovering over Whirlow, Sheffield, United Kingdom...then they all just disappeared.","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"GB-05112009-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
