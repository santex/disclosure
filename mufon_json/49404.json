After looking at the object for a few seconds, I could see it was moving very slowly. It was a very bright yellow-orange color. I watched the light travel on a slow straight course for about two minutes and it appeared to get closer to me. As it got closer, I saw tiny white lights pulsate a few times. Then the light went behind my house and I could no longer see it due to trees."],"Case Number":"49404","Tags":"City"}
