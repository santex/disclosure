I work in a camera store, so I grabbed a Canon video HiDef video camera and filmed the object for several minutes. Once I got a fix on the object and zoomed in, it appeared to be diamond shaped. It's coloring was a translucent pinkish blue and white. I thought it could be a reaction to the auto focus of the camera. So I zoomed in and out several times, but the object always kept the same shape. After zooming out one last time, I couldn't find it again, and the bright light in the Eastern part of the sky was gone."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15852.html"],"Longitude":"-95.36604","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Object Shape":"Diamond","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.765363,+-95.36604(15852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15852) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"29.765363","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were 2 other sightings in Houston on or around March 2nd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Bright star like object in the North Eastern portion of the sky.","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"03/02/2009 04:24 UTC"}
