'something' is fly. appeared for third time. beautiful flight. what is it - i dont know. cant see it well (now). if there will be time, i will go and turn the room lights off. almost lost it sight (now). not brighter then a star... but still visible. changing course. so... i lost it. will turn light off now and continue...\" i didnt saw it again, so didnt make new shots."],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Summary":"Very bright object moved across sky over town.
