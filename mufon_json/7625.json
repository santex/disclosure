Early spring, 1990. I was deep sleeping like a log when I just bolted upright for no apparent reason as if I had heard a really loud noise but there wasn't one. and for some reason was called to look out the window so I did but there wasn't anything there. I kept staring, then the bright green cigar shape came out of the east and cruised across the horizon at a steady pace slowly and silently and then disappeared into the trees to the west. I knew it was a ufo immediately. i felt i was called to see it. I had seen one about 10 years earlier near Barnum Minnesota do short bursts of speed and a zig zag and then bolt out of the sky at a sharp angle. I never felt scared. I woke my girlfriend up and I think she may have seen the last glow of it through the trees."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
