At first I thought it might be military flare but it was moving at constant speed and altitude and then suddenly changed direction 90 degrees to orginal flight path and then suddenly sped away into cloud cover at very high rate of speed. Much brighter than either an aircraft landing light or a typical military flare, both of which I am quite familiar with. It disappeared into the cloud front and then suddenly the light went out. I've lived here for 12 years and I've seen lots of military flares and aircraft landing lights, but I have never seen anything even remotely like this. It was not an aircraft landing light, flare, or anything like that."],"Region":"Florida","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.912667,+-82.278189(38489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38489) map </A>"}
