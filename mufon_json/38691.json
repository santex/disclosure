One interacted with us.","Latitude":"35.240647","Case Number":"38691","City":"Brevard","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i were camping in the pisgah nat'l forest, up near the peak of looking glass rock. we were facing to the south, looking up at what i estimate to be around 60-70 degrees up in the sky. i found myself staring at a star that seemed to be getting brighter and dimmer, then maybe sometimes even slightly blinking away momentarily. i thought that maybe there were some leaves at the tip of a tree branch that kind of hung over my field of view, so i leaned over to my right where the tree was definitely not in the way anymore. but the star kept making this \"oscillating\" effect with the light it was shining! i thought to myself, \"this is not a star, this is a ufo!\" when my wife turned to me and said, \"honey, what's that?\" while pointing over to my left. i looked up where she was pointing just in time to see a \"star\" flying eastward. it was not blinking or oscillating or anything like that. just a white dot traveling through the sky. as it was traveling by, it flew in a mostly straight line, but then it made a few sharp angles that would be impossible for any aircraft to make, before going back into a mostly straight line again, and then blinking out of sight, leaving a light streak or trail behind it that instantly disappeared! the first thing that came to mind in terms of how to describe the pattern it flew in, is that it looked like a sawtooth wave. forgive me for the comparison, as i am an audio engineer, and that was the first thing it reminded me of, but it later occurred to me that it also looks like the pattern that is displayed on an electrocardiogram machine. you know, that ecg monitor that people get hooked up to in hospitals that shows your heart beat? that's the pattern it flew off in! so i answered my wife by saying, \"that right there is what they call a ufo, honey,\" and immediately turned my attention back to the right, at the ufo i was looking at. my wife was very excited, vocalizing how that was her first ufo ever, and how amazing that was, and she noticed i was looking at this other \"star.\" she then said, \"is that one too?\" i told her that i thought it was, and explained how the strobing\\oscillating thing it was doing can't be explained by the tree because from where i repositioned myself the branches were no longer in the way. she then said that she, too, was noticing that star, before seeing the other ufo that just flew off, and she thought it was just leaves getting in the way. right at this point it decided to start moving! and i mean, it moved, in a way that we could only think that it knew we were watching it, and it was saying, \"look at me! look at me!!\" it started dipping down, flying up, making circles, getting brighter, and just, acting out! my wife and i both saw this! but then, the most exciting part, to me, is that my wife was somehow able to really focus on the object itself, through the light it was radiating, and see that it was spinning, doing somersaults, and apparently shaped like a gyroscope. i personally did not see this, although i saw \"patterns of light\" being emitted from it, which were changing and shifting. this thing, every once in a while, would try to hover around a general area, as if to tell us, \"this is my job, i can't leave my post, i have to stay around this general area and look like a star,\" or something like that. it was following the general path of the the rest of the stars through the sky, but it was doing it in a very whimsical, almost clumsy manner. i eventually started dozing off, but the thing was still there all along. at one point, as i was fighting sleep, i caught myself with my eyes closed and opened them back up again, just in time to see the ufo back up in the original spot in the sky that i started seeing it in, and it quickly sped back down to where it should have been due to the earth's orbit at that time. i went to sleep with the thought of, \"this is it, finally! i have seen them up close and personal, on top of a mountain, with no possible doubt any more, that what i'm seeing is a meteorological phenomenon or human aircraft.\" then i went to sleep. since that night i have been experiencing some \"synchronicities\" and other sort of mental phenomena which i don't comprehend yet. one thing i forgot to mention above is that during the event i felt like i was having thoughts that i don't normally have, and i found myself \"feeling like\" i had some kind of golden bubble around me that was coming from my breath. i can't help but feel like the ufo somehow was involved in this. nothing like that has happened before. ********************************************************************* my wife wrote a report as well, which is as follows: we set up the tent, built a fire, spent a few hours watching in burn down, and climbed into the tent to watch the stars before falling asleep. i had already set everything up in the tent with the sleeping bags facing the largest expanse of sky to north. at the last second, i had a strong urge to turn the sleeping bag around. i just went with it automatically and told my husband we should face the other way, so we flipped the bags around and finally settled in. i clearly remember noticing the star that \"danced\" for us right away, because it looked like it was almost flashing, or strobing, but from my point of view, it was directly behind a big tree, and i just brushed it off as wind in the branches obscuring a really bright star. i was focusing on the section of sky to the left (east) of that big tree where there were a few bright stars twinkling. i remember thinking at this point, \"why did i turn the bags around, we're looking at a bunch of trees?\" but my husband wasn't complaining, and i was comfy and tired, so i didn't mention it. a few minutes later, one of the stars i was looking at moved! it happened so fast, but i know as soon as that first movement registered, i said something like, \"honey, do you see that?\" and pointed. he saw it at the same time that it started zig-zagging across the sky. it flew like a dragonfly. it had very erratic movements, but patterned; it made a short, fast leap, paused, then a long, fast leap, then it would change direction at a 90 degree angle, i think, and start the pattern over (this all happened faster than any craft we're supposed to know about could manage!). it did this three or fours times, and it left a trail of light in its wake, so by the time it disappeared from my field of vision, i could still barely make out its trail across the sky. its burned into my memory, even though it happened so fast. its the first i've ever seen with my own eyes! that my husband saw it too makes it that much more special. the impression i got from this one was, \"oh, crap, i've been spotted! retreat!\" as soon as i focused on it, it streaked away. so i was all excited, and my husband gets excited too, and he points out the 'star' behind the tree. i mentioned that i had seen it, too, and that's when everything he lays out above took place. what i saw differs slightly from what he saw, but only in that i definitely saw something beyond the light itself. it wasn't more than a shadow of something, but it was rolling and spinning and the light kept shifting and changing configurations all around it. i was finally able to form the thought today that it moved just like a gyroscope moves! it seemed to me to be overjoyed that someone was watching it and giving it attention. it was showing off and prancing around and radiating joy, is the only way to put it. it would occasionally blink out all together, and there were a few times we thought it had disappeared for good, but it kept coming back, at least until i fell asleep, which was before my husband."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.240647,+-82.729762(38691)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38691) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05312012-0012","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other"}
