Other","divs":["sighting detailson the evening of september 15th, 2009 i searched youtube for ufo video's to pass the time. i came across youtube address seeingufospa and was taken back that this woman lives 40 minutes from my home. she has an open invitation for people to come and help observe these events with her. i knew from the beginning she had nothing to hind and i set a date to meet with her. on the evening of september 24th, 2009 we, my girlfriend (sandy) and i arrived in her general area at 7:30 p.m. i followed directions of the location to be by a google earth map location she had shown on her youtube site. this area is very rural, hilly, heavily wooded, dark and very quite. without knowing where to start or where to look i decided to start at a golf course i found in her general area. sandy and i walked around the golf course for a while and found nothing of interest. i decided to leave the golf course and drive around the area for awhile. while driving, i called alison about 7:55 and informed her we were in the area and asked her where we should meet. at that same time i passed a car along the road and alison asked if that was me that just passed her. i replied i think so. alison said pull over, there is one directly above you. i pulled over and we jumped out of the car and found alison with her camera in her hand recording a bright, slow moving object 300 feet above us. it is now 8:01 p.m. i grabed my camcorder to record this event also, i was so excited i forgot to remove the lens cap and missed most of that event. my first impression was this craft is completely silent and moved in a very slow smooth line. i recall it being an amber\\golden glow that pulsed. it continued in what appeared to be a straight line and moved at a slow consistent speed. this sighting lasted 40 seconds or so. alison, sandy and myself headed back to the golf course for awhile and found and recorded a golden orb as seen in the attached video. while recording this object it moved slowly and suddenly streaked across the sky to reappeared a mile away. we then headed to a farm field alison knew. we stood and talked for 30 minutes or so and began to see lights that appeared in the trees. they were below the tree tops staying half way between there and the ground. i recorded eight(8) separate objects that evening. while alison recorded other objects from a different location at the farm, i believe there were 12 separate sightings that evening. at the farm lands i found a very bright light in the trees, as i set up to record the light it decreased in size and intensity. this object was located on the next ridge about 1000 feet away. these recordings i took are remarkable. the image shows a round globe, white to golden in surface color with red texture\\lines under the surface, with an \"eye\" or round design\\object within the lines. this interior structure seems to be looking around. after recording it for 30 seconds or so the interior detail disappeared and there is only a whiteish\\golden glow. after recording this glowing object for 15 minutes or so, noticed as i zoom out from the object it appears to pulse. as i zoom back in, the detail once again is present for a time and then disappears. this process went on several times. after record that object in the trees i began to notice lights in several different locations. i asked alison if there were any homes located near the lights, she said no. several of these lights seem to turn on at different times and would disappear and suddenly a light would appear in the sky above. several recording made by alison were recorded by me from a different angle\\location. my camcorder is an older unit so my tapes are not as good as the high definition ones but they are real. some of these objects\\craft seem to make a plane like noise although the noise seems to be somewhat off or \"late\". something about them seems unreal. most though are completely silent. i am complete impressed and totally convinced these objects\\craft are nothing i have ever seen. alison kruse is completely up front and forth right. her recordings, in my professional opinion, are some of the best evidence i have ever seen. i will personally testify that her recordings and her sightings to be 100% creditable and 100% real. there are many more hours of recordings by alison and myself that have not yet been seen. i have returned to record more on september 30th and october 1st 2009. i also have plans to return the evenings of october 18th, 19th and 20th to help alison. i also plan to personally trek into the woods as deeply as possible and record what ever it is we find. i can not get the video address to go into the address bar so follow this link.
