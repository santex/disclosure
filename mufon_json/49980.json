I was lying on the bed looking out the window, when I noticed it. I can see the jets take off from the airport and I was just looking at them. I noticed an object, all I could really make out was that it was two blue lights. They were side by side. It was in the distance and it went straight for a few miles, then it returned in the same direction it came from without stopping. That was when it got my attention.
