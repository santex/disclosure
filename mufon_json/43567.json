We looked up at a beautiful moon... when we noticed an object very high in the sky with a trail similar to a meteorite behind it but it moved from East to West with a periodically flashing light. My husband thought it was some kind of aircraft but it seemed to move very fast. When the object changed direction going south then west again almost perpendicular in movement. As we continued to watch it did it again... it did it 3 times while we watched it move across the sky."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in San Dimas","There were no other sightings in San Dimas on or around October 27th 2012"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.131815,+-117.827261(43567)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43567) map </A>","Longitude":"-117.827261","Log Number":"US-10282012-0007","Latitude":"34.131815","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
