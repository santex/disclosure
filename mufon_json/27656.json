{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["sighting detailsi was returning home from school that thursday evening, my class had released early so i was enjoying the beautiful sunset on my way home. through the trees the magnitude of brightness the sun was producing struck me as odd, i thought to myself \"wow the sun is big tonight\". as i rounded the corner the sun came into center view. it looked like it was on fire. i rubbed my eyes a bit and tried to focus, to make sure i was really seeing the sun that way, grabbed my glasses and realized i wasn���t seeing things, the sun really did look like a ball of fire. so i pulled my car over and began taking pictures with my iphone from my car window. i remembered i had my camera in my bag so i got out of the car and stood on the guardrail and snapped away with my cannon power shot. after several minutes i got in my car and drove a bit farther down the road to get a different angle on the picture and began to shoot again. i was so proud of my sunset pictures; i had never seen anything like that before. i showed friends, everyone amazed by the sun. today i was uploading to my computer, and began inspecting the pictures more carefully and came to find several objects or smudges in the images. you can see all the photos taken at *(link moved to additional evidence section -- cms\\sg).i hope someone analyzes these pictures, because i really do not know what i captured, but there is something there. i have lived within flight patterns for both bwi and national my entire life, i can pick the planes out in the pictures, and it is the other objects i am unsure of."],"City":"Burtonsville","Latitude":"39.111219","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02042011-0017","Longitude":"-76.932475","Summary":"Objects not seen by naked eye found in pictures of sunset near D.C.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Burtonsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Maryland","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.111219,+-76.932475(27656)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27656) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/04/2011 09:59 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"27656","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Saturn-like, Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/13/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27656.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27656_submitter_file1__002.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27656_submitter_file2__008.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27656_submitter_file3__Sun1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27656.html"]}
