the sighting i experienced was true beyond a doubt and the ship's travel newspaper article was planned to coincide with a time that would discount the credibility of anyone reporting such and incident, how clever. during the next few weeks before my pending transfer, i found myself seeking more knowledge about ufo's. as i poured through frank edwards book \"flying saucers serious business.\" i found several things that coincided with my sighting with amazing accuracy. searching my mind i recalled my experience and took note of the similarities. 1. the craft was a great deal like many of those documented. 2. the color had an aluminized glow. 3. there was a total lack of sound during its flight. 4. the shape was definately saucer like from a side view. 5. speed of travel was remarkable. 6. length of craft was approximately 38 to 40 feet. i came to the conclusion of the length because the craft, when directly centered at the road, it overlapped both sides of the black top by 3 to 4 feet, the black top was right at 30 feet wide. during my research, another startling fact surfaced. it was documented that many times when ufo's were sighted they were near or in the immediate vacinity of nitrogen in bulk form. i, being an aviation stuctural mechanic, had numerous occasions to service the aircraft oxygen breathing systems. aviator's breathing oxygen was always available but the nitrogen to purge the contaminated systems was not. the by-product of oxygen is nitorgen and is always produced when the oxygen is being manufactured or produced. inverably we were required to special order the nitrogen when systems purging was necessary. now the oxygen generating plant was located very near where my sighting had taken place. i knew the airman who delivered the oxygen from the oxygen farm. i asked him why we could not obtain nitrogen from the farm ourselves when we needed it instead of having to order it. he told me that the oxygen plant had not been able to produce nitrogen for over 2 years since that portion of the equipment was broken down and produced only contaminated water pumped nitrogen. i asked him what happened to the contaminated nitrogen and he told me that it was just pumped and dumped onto the ground and left to disipate on the sight. *** 6\\21\\1992: my name is {pid2} i was born in puerto rico in 1966 and had the opportunity to be stationed at roosevelt roads naval station while in the naval mobile construction battalion or sea bees and recalled from the reserves for operation desert storm. during my seven month deployment there i was well aware of my dad's story about his ufo sighting 25 years earlier and i wanted to do some investigating of my own. i retraced his steps from where the hanger was, back toward the hill and up it. i described to my dad where the enlisted man's club was and where the galley was and the female baracks. we worked out the possible direction based on his description and confirmation of the building locations on the base. one day i had the opportunity to be alone driving around the base to a job site i was working at the east end. i drove upon a pond with a large building and many silver canistars stacked. we figured this to be the oxygen farm that was also producing nitrogen. this facility was right in line with the direction the saucer had been flying. across the street was a dirt road that headed directly into the area the saucer would have came from if it were just taking off right before my dad saw it. i decided to drive up the dirt road to see where it would lead. i came upon a chain across the road and an empty guard shack. i was startled when a recorded voice spoke over a loud speaker, \"you are entering a restricted area!\" i decided i'd better back that 2 1\\2 ton truck up and get out of there since i was due at the airforce barracks where rnmcb 16's delta company was working, and i did not want to get into trouble. during my time at the base i also noticed several ships with teathered balloon type radar devises and most of the time they were just off the coast and within sight with those balloons extended. i read in a book that those can be used to triangulate and track flying craft. *** 10\\1\\2007: i just discovered google earth for the first time and decided to zero in on the area of roosevelt roads naval station that i was investigating in 1992. it is amazing to see nothing has changed on the map. i noticed in the area i was told to get out of and just past that gate, there are many mounds of dirt and dirt roads leading to them. it seems the area is a weapons storage depot, which makes sense. however if you look closely there is a mysterious area just to the south that is in a heavily jungle growth type area that has an impression of a large unnatural square shape. {cms\\jat\\pid1 & pid2} text moved to narrative"],"Summary":"1967 Puerto Rico sighting & 1992 follow up to first report.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
