He thinks they are UFO. I have hundreds of identical and even more deatiled photos indcluding mazes, large multicolored diamonds, rods, photos with hundreds of the spheres with membranes and without. These spheres have appeared in photos on 35mm, digital, black and white film over 158 sessions with as many as 120 people at a time. They appear upon request. I believe they are interdimensional consciousness because they play and interact with us. UFO? They do not fly nor are they unidentified. They appear and interact. If Abi s photo is blown up you will find it consists of thousands of spheres of light (orbs)."]}
