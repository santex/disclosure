I was at working throwing away some cardboard on tha side of the building . When I look up and saw a very shinny object that was shape like a football. I thought it was just a nice looking plain flying very low and cruising by. I didn't think to much of it . Till I starting noticing it wasn't going across the sky anymore, instead it starting going upward like a helicopter would be able to. I just keep looking at it till it went upward into the clear blue sky and disappeared out of the atmosphere like a rocket. I mention it to family members and friends that it look like it was watching the area and I believed something might happen like a nature disaster . Because I seen on a tv show that UFO are seen before nature disasters . But they didn't think much of it. But the next day on saturday aug 4 , we had wierd and sudden weather change. We got a thunderstorm in tha area but tha wired part was that a all week we had 100+ degree weather & the news never mention of any rain or thunderstorm . It suppose to be another hot 102��� day. Then if that wasn't strang that Monday Aug 6 at 12:46am we had a Earthquack in the area. I believe all those strange and close events where all related .."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-120.328101","Tags":"City","Summary":"I was at work throwing away the trash and I seen a shinny object flying very low .
