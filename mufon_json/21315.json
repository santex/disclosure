{"Longitude":"-122.79615","Weather Factors":"Rain, Light","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"cigar shape ship 5-7 red circle lights/ white search lights at the ends","divs":["Sighting Details(I have been very interested in learning the truth about ufos and metaphysics all though out my life. until recently I have never seen a ufo but this is what I saw) I was driving to Fred Meyers (which is a grocery store in my area) The weather was dark mild rain storm was going on; but strangely there were some pockets of clear spots. I park my car, at the store. The other people around me were rushing into the Fred Meyers to hide from the rain and cold, cars where driving past me as well. There was a high feeling of stress area) I saw a flash of white light more in a searching pattern. the ship flew over the Fred Meyer store and I only I saw the ship clearly for a around 10 seconds it was thin and shape was like cigar, the color of the ship was black I believe; or a very dark color on the ends of the ship there was very bright white \"search lights\" that were scanning the air. There was a around 5-7 red circle glowing light. (Maybe port holes?) It moved very lowing though the air. (I was in shock when I saw the UFO but I could easy move. I kept looking around at the ship and the other people around me and no one else seem to see and even care about looking up. The ship moved into the clouds and I lost clear slight of the ship but the ���white search lights were still easy seen. The ufo flew out of the parking area and I was soaking wet at the time so I went into store. While I was trying to finish my shopping I felt a strong wave feeling past though me and for a second I thought I might loose my balance. No one else seems to notice the wave feeling either. (I have been reading and watching many books and videos about this subject but learning how the ships work is very difficult to find. But I have believed more in the info from the federation of light and they say that their ships can only be seen by people that have higher spiritual energy. Or when they choose to lower there energy (but my gut is leaning more to the whole Nazi American ufo theory about the ship that I saw. Because I felt no spiritual upliftment the search light look more human but more powerful then any air plane light that I seen ) I'm a Buddhist, and see a lot of what the federation of light speaks about connecting with a lot what I believe in. But I also don't know if it just BS. I have been having strange dreams (where I am talking and learning things from people but I can���t remember enough to make sense of it. I have Seen what I believed were sprits. Sense the age of five but when you get in the whole federation of light theory in connects aliens with spiritual expericances and it makes a lot of sense. The only problem is can you trust the source of the information?)"],"Latitude":"45.491622","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-01012010-0026","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21315.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21315.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/01/2010 11:38 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.491622,+-122.79615(21315)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21315) map </A>","City":"Beaverton","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"12/31/2009 09:22 UTC","Region":"Oregon","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Beaverton","There were no other sightings in Beaverton on or around December 31st 2009"],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Case Number":"21315"}
