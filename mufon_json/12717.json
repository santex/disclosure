The object was motionless for over an hour and changed colors fairly rapidly from Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and White. It stayed in between the same grouping of trees for over an hour, I went inside for a short while and when I came out it was gone. We are close to the landing pattern for Chicago airports and I have viewed the airplane lights my whole life, this was no airplane! I personally witnessed the Phoenix lights in AZ and had the same feeling as I did then. I felt an awe of knowing that something was watching from a distance, something intelligent with great curiosity in what we are doing here on earth. It's an exhilarating feeling with no sense of fear. Hopefully next time I will get a picture to post."],"Log Number":"US-09222008-0013","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Michigan City","There were no other sightings in Michigan City on or around September 15th 2008"],"Region":"Indiana","Latitude":"41.716009","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","City":"Michigan City","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Star-like, Changed colors, very vibrant.
