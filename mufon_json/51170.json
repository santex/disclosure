We get helicopters that fly low it the area often but not this low.We noticed it flying overhead but it was quiet as a whisper! Then I was like that's a plane see the wings but then I did a double take cause it turned around doing perfect 180 in mid flight! So then we were like a chopper?No.No sound but a slight buzzing sound humm. Then in perfect formation one exactly behind the other at least three more just like it followed the first one we seen.Oh ya they had a blueish orange round lite on both wing tips which did not blink.Then we went inside to eat then google searched for any aircraft like that in the area but came up with nothing."],"Date Submitted":"09/29/2013 12:25 UTC","Case Number":"51170","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.452997","Summary":"drone sized and shape aircraft with orange and blue mixed bright balls of light on both sides of wings.","Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cross","City":"Phoenix","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.452997,+-112.065377(51170)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51170) map </A>","Longitude":"-112.065377","Object Features":"Wings","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51170.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51170.html"],"Log Number":"US-09292013-0013","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"09/28/2013 12:00 UTC"}
