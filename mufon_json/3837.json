We were standing on our porch looking Northwest. It was behing trees when I went outside. It slowly appeared from behind the trees moving toward the West. There was no noise at all. Our guess is it was about 300 ft. above us going about the same speed as a small airplane. The object just flew out of sight behind more trees and about 45 sec. later an airplane headed from the west toward where we lost sight of it."],"Object Shape":"Disc","Case Number":"3837","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Circle Pines","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3837.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3837.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Large disk moving slowly, very low and quiet"}
