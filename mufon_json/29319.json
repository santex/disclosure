{"Summary":"Photo of unknown object releasing chemtrails","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was observing what appeared to be a jet at high altitude, approx 30-35,000 ft. with a very clear and noticable trail being emitted. I wasnt able to see the plane so I zoomed in as best I could and was able to get this one picture. After examineing it I decided to submit it to your organization. I was taking a break from mowing when I noticed it. I have other photos a few hours later of the sky that evening. Probably moot but it did rain for several hours on sunday may 30th."],"Latitude":"42.601119","Tags":"City","Case Number":"29319","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Monroe","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29319_submitter_file1__007.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29319_submitter_file2__009.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29319_submitter_file3__017.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29319.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.601119,+-89.638453(29319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29319) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05302011-0015","City":"Monroe","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/30/2011 07:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/28/2011 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-89.638453"}
