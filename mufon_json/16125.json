It resembles the Barney & Betty hill craft with similar windows and entities.","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were stationed in Long Beach,CA during the years 71-74. While traveling down the highway a slow moving Disc is spotted by my mother. It had a metallic grey color with a roll of windows going all the way around the craft. It resembled the famous Barny & Betty Hill craft. In fact, as the craft passed over the highway beings could be spotted through the windows. They were standing and appeared to be looking out the shaded windows. It was very low to the highway and then moving right to left exited the veiwing area. What is most fascinating about this incident is that it was seen by multiple witnesses and the people or beings could be seen looking out the windows which wrapped all the way around the craft. They appeared to have had larger than normal heads, or were wearing some kind of gear.If someone would like further details feel free to contact us."],"Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around June 17th 1971"],"Country":"United States","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Los Angeles","Log Number":"US-03202009-0005","Latitude":"33.739462","Case Number":"16125","Date of the Event":"06/17/1971 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown"}
