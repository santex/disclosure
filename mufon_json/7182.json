Parkway between Herndon and Sterling around 8:00pm on March 4th when a large glowing object caught my eye. It was much larger than the largest star and was not as bright as a street light, hence why I described it as glowing. By the time my eyes were able to focus on the glowing circular object it started picking up speed. It moved northward horizontally in a strait line at amazing speed until it vanished. It made fighter jets look slow. Too bad I could not tell the size or altitude. I felt very excited and knew this was no normal craft. I'm sure some other people had to have seen this and I should have reported it sooner."],"Object Features":"None","Summary":"Circle glowing much larger that the largest star accelerated across the sky to amazing speed then vanished.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.969554,+-77.386098(7182)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7182) map </A>","Latitude":"38.969554","Case Number":"7182","Log Number":"US-06082007-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Herndon","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Virginia","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Herndon","There were no other sightings in Herndon on or around March 4th 2007"]}
