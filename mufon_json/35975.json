It was a clear night with many stars and I saw a gigantic black and gray object move incredibly fast from behind me to far out in front of me till i couldn't see it anymore in less than 5 seconds. I was stunned at how fast it went and it was pretty low but still higher than nearby airplanes. It was the color of the sky with a gray outline and was moving in a straight line. I quickly ran back to my dorm."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"35975","Log Number":"US-02212012-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.762673,+-79.01014(35975)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35975) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
