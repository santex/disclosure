{"Country":"United States","Case Number":"31769","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was half sleep in my bed when I felt a presence in my room . I turned very quickly to my right when I saw a small humanoid beside me for 2 or 3 seconds. I saw a definite shape and a hand with no digits on my shoulder. I just saw a feature-less humanoid figure . The height was about 4 feet but was not solid but sort of translucent and went out of my sight like a star trek transporter would do. It seem phased or not in my space-time or inter-dimensional. I have had enough strange happenings( missing time, lights being turned off when I wake) to know this was just part of it and real. I immediately got up and sat on my bed for 15 minutes wondering what I saw."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/12/2011 01:46 UTC","Log Number":"US-09122011-0010","Latitude":"42.448338","Longitude":"-70.995597","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Saugus","There were no other sightings in Saugus on or around August 26th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31769.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31769.html"],"City":"Saugus","Object Shape":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Saw an entity near my bed touching my shoulder","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.448338,+-70.995597(31769)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31769) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/26/2011 12:00 UTC","Region":"Massachusetts"}
