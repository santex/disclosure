I originally thought they were planes or helicopters, but eventually pulled off to the side of the road to get a better look. The lights were still in a perfect triangle, and seemed to be coming closer at a moderately fast rate (slightly faster than a plane, but noticeable from a distance). The only camera I had with me was a PlayStation Portable camera, and shooting at 1.3 MP, it's not the best. I did, however, capture two of the three lights on film, ending with one light. Shortly after, all lights had disappeared. I had considered not filing a report for the idea that it might not have been a UFO, but after observing a plane minutes later, I knew the behavior exhibited by the triangle did not match the plane's behavior (the triangle had very bright, multicolored, blinking, lights; the plane did not)."],"Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"19721","Log Number":"US-09292009-0004","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.254974,+-111.632029(19721)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19721) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/28/2009 07:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19721.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19721.html"],"Longitude":"-111.632029"}
