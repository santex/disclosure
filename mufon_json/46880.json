I thought that what i saw was a pelican hovering over the dunes back and forth. This can be a very common sight, so I didn't pay much attention at first. From where we were standing the parking lot lights were the orange color HPS type, I thought the glow was just reflecting off the chest of the pelican. After a few minutes I looked back towards the dunes and thought a reflection couldn't be that bright. It was then I realized this was not a late night glowing,hovering pelican, but something even more strange! I whipped out my 5 year old beat up LG Smartphone, shot the required terrible movie images and then it slowly and silently rose to the northeast and vanished. It was a slow steady rise to the left and disappeared into the darkness, maybe a mile away. Blew my mind! I have perfect vision and was not doing any drugs or alcohol!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46880.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-97.20636","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Corpus Christi","There were no other sightings in Corpus Christi on or around April 20th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.619539,+-97.20636(46880)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46880) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Corpus Christi"}
