It was 10:40 pm. I immediately observed a very bright nonpulsing red light moving at high altitude jet speed. I walked to a more open area of the yard and expected the light to be in a projected spot. It wasn't moving as expected. It was slowing down and came to a complete stop and immediately started to travel straight up. It was rotating as it ascended ( the light was on only one surface, so it was not visible while opposite me). The light was getting smaller in size and after three rotations disappeared. I am a retired air traffic controller and an active pilot. This did not appear as an aircraft would in the night sky. The sky was absolutely clear."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"06/08/2013 09:14 UTC","Case Number":"47976","City":"Britton"}
