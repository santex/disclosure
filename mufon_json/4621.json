I really don't want to be know, so please excuse the name I sent.... My friends and I were sailing through the Hawaiian islands. We were 87 not.miles south of the Big Island (Hawaii) and finishing up our beers on deck, while buttoning things up for the night. My good friend noticed a bright light under the water, about 12 feet infont of the bow. It gave off three distinct colors, that faded in and out slowly. We called our wives up topside and asked them what they thought it was. We all thought it might be a sub, but then the lights became brighter. The girls got VERY scared as did we and then whatever it was took off fast. So fast that it rocked our boat. I don't know of anything that could be up and gone, from not a movement to out of sight in seconds. This thing just sat under water and bolted... gone. We saw the lights disapear, as it left. We did not get photos in time, but please do not discard this. It was very real and has stuck with all of us since."],"Case Number":"4621","Tags":"City","Region":"Hawaii","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.897856,+-155.578602(4621)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4621) map </A>","trends":[""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04032006-0014","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
