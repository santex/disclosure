Then began zig zagging and pulsating bright green light before going out of view.","Log Number":"US-10212013-0028","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was Saturday October 19th, 2013. My girlfriend and I went outside to walk the dogs at 7 PM. She went ahead of me. When I walked out I noticed the bright orange moon to the East. I asked, ���did you see that moon���? My girlfriend looked straight up and she noticed the small, slow moving green light directly above us. It was very high, I immediately thought it was a satellite. Moving from a West to East direction. We just stood there and watched it for a few minutes when we saw the object make a sharp 45 degree movement to the SE. Right after that the object began to shine incredibly brightly! I remember we both gasped when the object flashed! The brightness increased by 15% or more. It pulsated 3 times, then went back to the original brightness. It turned sharply again heading East. That���s when I could see a second object similar perhaps smaller in size and speed but the light was more yellow. My girlfriend said she couldn���t see the second object. The second object seemed to run along right next to the green object, then the yellow object was gone. The Green object made another zig-zag movement. We watched the object from 7:00 to 7:11 PM until it was out of our view. Last seen it was heading in a SE 130��� direction from our location. I've been watching stars for many years and have observed many satellites and have never seen one zig zag sharply or glow intensely as this one did. It sure looked cool whatever it was!"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Centennial","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.585485,+-104.869833(51721)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51721) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Centennial","There were no other sightings in Centennial on or around October 19th 2013"],"Region":"Colorado","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"10/21/2013 08:41 UTC"}
