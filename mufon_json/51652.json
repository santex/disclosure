Today, about 2 weeks later, I uploaded the pictures to my computer for editing. I noticed a strange image on one of the photos. I thought it was a small plane or maybe a dust particle on the camera lens but the shots I took immediately after and before did not have that image. I took the images consecutively, all within seconds of each other. The closer I zoomed into the other images I was able to see some unidentifiable object in each of the images, just not as clear as the first one I saw. I will upload the images. They have not been edited except for I think I cropped one of the images. The image with the most evident object is #4404, you can see it under the moon, kind of. The first shot (4403) only has the bright orb on the uppermost left hand side of the photo, looks like a star, but it is not int he other images. In the rest of the images the object is unclear, more to the right but appears to be further away."],"Log Number":"VI-10192013-0008","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St. Thomas","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"strange objects caught on photos","Latitude":"18.335361","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51652.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51652_submitter_file1__DSC04403.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51652_submitter_file2__DSC04404.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51652_submitter_file3__DSC04405.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51652_submitter_file4__DSC04407.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51652_submitter_file5__DSC04408.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51652.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"St. Thomas","Longitude":"-64.953401","Case Number":"51652","Date of the Event":"10/06/2013 06:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"U.S. Virgin Islands","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/19/2013 04:14 UTC","Region":"St. Thomas","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
