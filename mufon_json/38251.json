I looked toward Paris Mountain and noticed some orange lights in the sky. At first sight I thought they were the lighted radio towers on the mountain, but then I realized that they were too high in the sky. I looked more closely and noticed that there were actually two rows of these lights flying in a V-pattern (with the bottom of the \"V\" pointed toward Paris Mountain). The lights that were further away appeared to be less bright. I kept driving and the trees blocked my view, so I drove very quickly to the median on Pelham in front of Bruster's (I wanted to stop driving so I could watch them). At this point I noticed the lights that were closest to me were swooping, diving, rising, and chasing after each other (just like they do in amateur video footage). Then these lights basically faded away. They just vanished. I drove to the Bruster's parking lot, but by the time I got there, they were completely gone."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
