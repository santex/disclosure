I saw this bright flashing light.It was small at first. At first I thought it was the light from the airport near by, but you can't see this light fro that side of the mountian.And I saw no beam like you would when it would rotate.Plus th timing of this light was completely wrong for it to have been that. As we got closer,the object in question became huge, and flashed rapidly Im guessing 3 times a second. There was no noise. I turned on my caution light which is on top of my truck roof. It also flashes.I was trying to get it's attention. To make contact I guess. It remained in its position and we turned off onto 231 north and contuied. We lost sight of it behind some tall trees."]}
