I looked up at sky and noticed these stars. It was very unusual because it was to early for any stars visible.

I noticed a formation of stars in the south moving northerly at a slow speed. As this formation of approximately 6 was passing directly overhead, the star on the left rear suddenly flew off to the left and went in counter clockwise manner completing a circle. I felt it noticed me and wanted to show itself. During this I noticed it turned dark gray and had short wings. When it was done it got back into formation and started glowing as a star. The formation kept moving north. I watched it until the formation went out of sight over the horizon. I heard soon afterwards that it was seen from the east side of Colorado Springs and that the formation was seen moving over the Rockies in a northerly direction."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/19/2012 02:22 UTC","Latitude":"38.847215","Object Features":"Other"}
