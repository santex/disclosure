I was in the garage looking out toward the Northeast (North of Auburn) just thinking that this is quite a great day when movement in the sky caught my attention. I saw an object flying due East and level. There was no sound and I saw neither props nor jet engines on it. It reflected the sun off its surface and appeared roundish or disc shaped. It then started flying in a tight circle-I've never seen a plane that was capable of doing such a thing. Then, from the North, it was joined by a second like object. The two circled each other for about a minute and then just disappeared from sight in the same instant still circling each other. I think they were discs as opposed to round because they would appear much thinner when making banking turns in the circle thus narrowing their reflective surface facing the sun."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.320834,+-85.599474(11737)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11737) map </A>","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07252008-0020","Object Shape":"Disc"}
