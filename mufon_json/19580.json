{"Case Number":"19580","Date of the Event":"09/22/2009 09:10 UTC","Longitude":"24.749562","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my balcony, when I saw a red flashing light at a distance of about 10 km, moving to the west, not too high above the horizon. Suddenly it disappeared. Few seconds later it came back, only this time it was moving in an opposite direction (to the east) and a little bit higher. Then it disappeared again. And when it showed up it was moving to the west again. It went on for a few kilometres accelerating its speed and disappeared again just to show up moments later moving to the east but this time much slower. It accelerated again decreasing its altitude and I lost it out of sight when it went behind a building."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/22/2009 02:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19580.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19580.html"],"Country":"Bulgaria","Log Number":"BG-09222009-0009","Region":"Plovdiv","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.143841","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Plovdiv","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Plovdiv","There were no other sightings in Plovdiv on or around September 22nd 2009"],"Summary":"Red flashing light repeatedly changing directions.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.143841,+24.749562(19580)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19580) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other"}
