(like a cop or ambulance light) and i watchted the 2 flashing lights for maybe a half hour to an hour, then the lights just went out. the mp turned his emergency light off as well. i kept my eye on the ocean towards the northwest and pondered what i had seen. it remained dark and i got bored and strated playing my guitar again. keeping an eye on things. after about an hour (i'm guessing on time, details of what i'm seeing are exact) the area where i last saw the 2 lights, to the north west, all of a sudden lit up like you would describe seeing a big football stadium lit up at night. a huge area. way, way out at sea. and i could see the 2 flashing lights again at the bottom center of this immense \"stadium light\". the mp turned his emergency lights on again and i noticed at the top of makaha ridge, just past polihale, emergency lights up there. there is a military installation up there which you can see from polihale. you should check it out on google earth there is something very mysterious going on up there. but then suddenly from the top of this huge stadium light came an object flying, towards makaha ridge. it seemed to be a long cigar shape and had several lights all in a horizontal row which seemed to twinkle. they weren't normal lights and it silently approached the island and appeared to land somewhere up on makaha ridge. immediately after all the lights out in the ocean disappeared and the mp's turned of their lights. about a half hour later 2 fighter jets took off from pmrf and disappeared over ni'ihau island. and thats my story. its 100% entirely true. i at first thought what i saw was top secret military technology. but over the years i've put some serious thought and research into this and i think it was military working with extraterrestrial entities. these events i observed on this night and other observations i have made do not frighten me in the least. i find it fascinating and would love to spend the rest of my life researching and investigation these phenomena. i'd be happy to share my other accounts with you. thanks for doing what you do!, **(wit's name deleted--cms\\sg_"],"Tags":"City"}
