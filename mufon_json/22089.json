I was trying to take some pictures of Orion. I saw the 'object' after the first pic, then I noticed a reddish spot in the sky...so I took another picture. It showed up again. if you look between the two pictures, you can see that the size of the object is a bit different, and isn't in the same spot. Then, last night I went back out to see if I could catch it again or recreate the event. I got nothing but sky and stars. Camera is a D3000. Exposures were set at 20-30 seconds. I also had a shade on the lens, and was sure there was no external light sources on the surface of lens...so I don't think it was a lens flare."],"Case Number":"22089","Summary":"object in photo","Date of the Event":"02/28/2010 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-81.650131","Source":"MUFON","City":"Jacksonville"}
