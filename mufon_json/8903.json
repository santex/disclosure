But while looking north I saw this red dot come out of the mountains, and hover up into the sky quickly in 4 seconds. I was surprised and curious. 5 minutes later I saw, which looked like a meteor, and I was scared, I was stareing at it as it got closer and closer, it looked like some kind of fire ball. It moved slowly, and did not look like any military craft. And than it zoomed east, and dissapeared. It makes me wonder if life is out there, or if the goverment is inventing new space crafts, or flying old UFOs."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/21/2005 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"36.119696","Log Number":"US-01152008-0046","Tags":"City","Region":"Nevada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.119696,+-115.167116(8903)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8903) map </A>","Summary":"While vacationing at Las Vegas and heading to LA, I spotted some werid things in the sky.","Case Number":"8903","Date Submitted":"08/21/2005 12:00 UTC","City":"Las Vegas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8903.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8903.html"]}
