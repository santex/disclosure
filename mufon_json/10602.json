Me, my sons, and my mother were at one of our pastures late in the afternoon when the sun was going down but still plenty of light when I looked up over the tree line about 10 acres away and what seemed to be 12 or so flashing red orange lights flitering up and down in and out with out hitting each other much like fire flies or a swarm of birds fly. They seemed to be heading west toward texas and were soundless. I quickly picked up my binoculars and noticed the lights seemed to fill a bubble like top and reflect off of what appeared to be a metallic roundish backside. The entire event only took about 15 seconds as I watched them move on to the west. If anybody has seen anything like this or know of other episodes please write back as this has always intriged me.
