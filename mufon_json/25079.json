At the same moment that I saw this there were planes in the sky so I was able to distinguish between them. The second one was a couple minutes later in a different part of the sky but not too far from where the first one was seen. And again after traveling a good distance at the same speed as the other one, it vanished. Both of these object moved at the same speed and they did not have tails like the meteors did nor did they have blinking lights like the planes. We were going to record it with our phones but the object was too faint to capture it on video."],"Latitude":"26.6299","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Date of the Event":"08/12/2010 09:52 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Lehigh Acres","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Lehigh Acres","There were no other sightings in Lehigh Acres on or around August 12th 2010"],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-81.618483","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
