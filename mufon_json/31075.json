I'm 26 years old and this sort of thing has been going on my entire life. i share the stories with you only wondering if others have experienced happenings like this. its pretty unbelievable but i swear its the truth to my knowledge. there are a lot of other things that have happened but ill save them for another time."],"Longitude":"-70.47342","City":"Carthage","Summary":"one of the most odd visits ive ever had. its happened before"}
