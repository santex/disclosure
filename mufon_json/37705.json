The one that hangs out at work is larger than a star and brighter and moves from one side of the building to the other. Another one appeared on highway 150 between Waco and Cherryville. It was sort of blue and white larger than the starlike one. They both disappeared when I got past Food Lion in Cherryville. After this I saw a plane with red blinking lights. I got home and went outside and the UFO's are not there. I felt Happy! I was not afraid of them. I wanted to go find them."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04242012-0003","Latitude":"35.376945","City":"Cherryville","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.394377"}
