After about 5 seconds I refocused my driving to the road in front of me as i was headed towards the breakdown lane.I manuevered my vehicle back into the slow lane and once again looked into the driver's side mirror and the object was gone. the vehicle behind me in the fast lane was still proceeding south behind me. the entire event lasted about 10 seconds. As I proceeded South as looked through my driver's side window and passenger side window into the sky looking for the object, it didn't reappear! After I proceeded approximately a mile South on the interstate I saw what looked like a red \"shooting star\" with a streak in the sky directly in front of me lasting about 2 seconds."],"Log Number":"US-01082012-0014","Region":"Vermont","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"43.159843","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/08/2012 02:46 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.159843,+-72.466395(34712)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34712) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Norwich","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Saw black triangular object w/yellow lights approx.50' above car behind me on highway","Longitude":"-72.466395","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34712.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34712.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/05/2012 04:50 UTC","City":"Norwich","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"34712"}
