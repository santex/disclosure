{"Longitude":"-116.204276","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Several very far-off sets of multicolored lights in different parts of the sky.","City":"Boise","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsright after sunset on sunday, i noticed an extra-twinkly star at magnetic north over the mountains, specifically bogus basin ski resort. the star, upon observation through binoculars was actually a central white light with a red, blue, and green light rotating around the central white light. after noticing this first star, a friend and i used his binoculars to look at other bright \"stars\" around the area and surprisingly, identified at least 6-7 others identical to the first all around the sky. occasionally, smaller white orbs could be seen separating from the colored lights and zipping around in all direction and then coming to a stand-still, then zipping around again, etc. we observed these orbs separating from three of the multicolored craft\\objects. we observed these object with his binoculars for about an hour. after that, he went home and i watched the initial light (at magnetic north about 55 degrees from horizontal) until around 10pm when i retired to bed. i have noticed this extra-twinkly star over bogus basin ski resort every clear night for two weeks straight. this was the first time i looked at it through binoculars. it does not seem to be hiding at all and i feel very calm and happy when observing this object. i walk home from work about four nights per week and feel like it is emitting some kind of peaceful vibration. i am an engineer by trade and am quite accustomed to dealing with natural phenomenon. this was not a natural phenomena. the colored lights did not rotate across the sky in the manner that stars or the iss do. i plan to purchase a telescope in the near future so that i may observe these objects in greater detail."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There was one other sighting in Boise on or around November 29th 2009"],"Latitude":"43.614931","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.614931,+-116.204276(20810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20810) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"20810","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/29/2009 06:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20810.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11302009-0012","Date Submitted":"11/30/2009 01:26 UTC","Region":"Idaho"}
