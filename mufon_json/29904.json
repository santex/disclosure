{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting outside with my dad tonight (July 3, 2011) on our front step around 10:30 PM in Philadelphia enjoying the 4th of July weekend when I noticed an orange ball floating in the sky. Having just watched a fireworks display at the park behind my house that had ended 15 minutes earlier, I initially thought it was a stray spark floating in the wind and brushed it off. I had pointed it out to my dad and he agreed that it was just that. However, the spark did not fizzle out like we've seen happen with other fireworks - and we began to realize that it was moving at a slow, steady speed in the direction of my house. Then, it curved and headed North. It started out as a tiny ball, but as it moved we watched it shrink down into a pin point and vanish somewhere over Northeast Philadelphia."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/04/2011 12:47 UTC","trends":[],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.204952","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-77.192825","Log Number":"US-07042011-0006","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Case Number":"29904","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.204952,+-77.192825(29904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29904) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29904.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29904.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 10:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Orange Glow Ball Over Philadelphia"}
