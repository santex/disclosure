It was late (approximately 10 PM) and I was outside shoveling snow to clear our parking deck. I was alone, but sensed something above me and looked up. I could see directly overhead a triangular shaped craft moving slowly and silently about 100 feet above the tops of the pine trees. The craft was outlined in a thin green line of lights, with a smaller concentric triangle of green light inside it. I watched it for about a minute until it moved out of my field of vision. I went inside and told my wife that I had just seen a UFO."],"Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"12/31/1998 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/31/1998 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lake Arrowhead","There were no other sightings in Lake Arrowhead on or around December 31st 1998"],"Summary":"A silent, triangular shaped craft with green concentric lights moved slowly through the sky overhead."}
