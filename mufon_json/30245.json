Thought it was a satellite until it just stopped. Never moved again. Looked like a star.","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I were sitting in his backyard in a couple of lawn chairs just chatting and star-gazing when he says \"Hey there's a satellite!\" I looked up and clearly saw a very high altitude light moving from SW to the NE over Nevada, Texas on July 17, 2011 at about 11:20pm. The object moved at about the speed you see from a satellite moving across the night sky so at first it wasn't unusual. Then suddenly the object stopped and never moved again. It just sat there like a star. We watched and waited to see if it moved again and it never did. Since we both had to work in the morning we finally just gave up waiting after about 30 minutes. I know its not the smoking gun the ufo enthusiasts are looking for but it is a factual description of exactly what we saw and it was certainly unusual."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.051611","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-96.364122","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/18/2011 01:46 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.051611,+-96.364122(30245)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30245) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07182011-0010","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30245.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30245.html"]}
