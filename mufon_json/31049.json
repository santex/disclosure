{"Log Number":"US-08202011-0019","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I went outside to look for something in my car and he looked up into the sky to the northwest of my house. In front of the clouds was two bright white lights moving around that we had never observed before and I have lived here for 11 years. They were moving very slowly and very much separate from each other. Then a third one joined them from the north. The first two went up and disappeared into the cloud. The third one moved around slowly and was a different color form the first two it was orange. It also went up into the clouds. As we stood there dumb founded looking at an empty sky two more came out of the north and moved around slowly and also went up into the clouds. The last two were white like the first two. We did not observe any more as we went inside."],"Date of the Event":"08/20/2011 08:50 UTC","City":"Bradenton","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"31049","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Bradenton","There was one other sighting in Bradenton on or around August 20th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"08/20/2011 09:17 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31049.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31049.html"],"Longitude":"-82.586568","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.486468,+-82.586568(31049)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31049) map </A>","Summary":"5 different lights appeared all were separate moving and hovering differently then dissapeared up into a cloud","Latitude":"27.486468"}
