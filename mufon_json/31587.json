The clouds looked funny at the time and I observed an oject coming out of the odd looking clouds. At first I thought it was an airplane until it got close, than it descended very fast which isn't usual for an aircraft, or not that I've ever seen. That is when I noticed that it was circular in shape and I could see the center was a lazer red light. It was rocking side to side and didn't like a smooth descent. It came down into a smalled wooded are which was about 50-6- yard wide with small trees and dense under growth. I turned onto the road of the wooded area and I didn't observe the object after that. At the time as I watched it rocking back and forth I felt like it was having mechanical problems."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"09/06/2011 03:32 UTC","Log Number":"US-09062011-0018","Object Features":"Dome","Case Number":"31587","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.417294,+-86.894664(31587)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31587) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.417294","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","Longitude":"-86.894664","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31587.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31587.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/15/2003 08:30 UTC"}
