I saw a big bright orange pulsating light followed by three more at about 10 second intervals. When I first saw it I could tell it was not an aircraft, and when the others appeared I knew they were not aircraft either. I thought it was really exciting. They headed NE and were visible for about 2 min total. They would slow down and then made a 90 degree turn at the same spot and then they vanished one by one as they reached the same spot."],"Date of the Event":"05/21/2013 09:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Region":"Washington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.744021,+-122.478083(47573)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47573) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Bellingham","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47573.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47573.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"47573","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/22/2013 12:08 UTC"}
