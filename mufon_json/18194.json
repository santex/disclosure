(although i only saw lights, in that they never changed their relationship to each other i call it a craft) as i looked at it i had guessed the size to be maybe as big as a football field traveling at 20 to 30 mph, what made no sense to me was that the choppers did not close on it even though they were doing at least 100 mph. this sighting was constantly on my mind for over a year trying to figure out some of the things that didn't add up until one day i stepped out to look up to see a cloud formation in the sky that cleared all the questions that i had. i now believe that the object was a mile or more sq\\rect.. and that it flew directly over the pentagon at 35 to 50 thousand feet which would increase it's speed to well over that of the choppers. i am seventy two years old, i had a background with aircraft in the army (choppers and fixed wing). i live under the landing pattern of reagan national and see planes landing at dulles to the west of me for 45 years. i am not prone to seeing \"things\"."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Vienna","There were no other sightings in Vienna on or around February 16th 2007"]}
