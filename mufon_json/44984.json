{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI live in toronto last night january 1 2013 about 1 am in the morning i was getting some air on the balcony when at first i saw a red light coming from the downtown area of toronto at first i thought it was a plane then the light turned left and headed my way east Im on the seventh floor as it passed a straight line in front of me i got a real good look at it it was white in the center as the light moved outward it gradually changed to orange and orange to a red glow there was also a pattern within the light it also had the most awesome glow to it unlike any other light i have ever seen before wow!!!!!!!!!!! i just stopped my jaw droped and i was in awe like i have never been before The light seemed to move slow and effortlessly and without a sound totally silent but some how the light was covering lots of ground and moving away quickly that part i really dont get how something can appear to be moving slowly but still moving out of your vision quickly As the light passed in front of me and away turning right now heading over lake ontario on a south east heading towards the united states it still seemed to be going slow but it began a steady climb upward maybe a 45 degree angle upward it begain to dim out on me untill it was just a little twinkle in the sky like a star and then nothing gone from my vision The whole sighting was about a minute and a half from start to finish All i can say is that i have always been a believer but im also a skeptic because im a need definitive proof kind of person and as far as im concerned now i have it thanks for listening PS if you get any other kind of news on the sighting i described from last night could you maybe tell me i have been looking around the internet tv news to see if anyone else saw it last night it would really help me a lot to know im not the only one who saw that last night thanks"],"Summary":"white light in the center as the light went outward turned orange and orange to red glow","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around January 1st 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.660966,+-79.381524(44984)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44984) map </A>","City":"Toronto","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-01032013-0019","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ontario","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-79.381524","Date of the Event":"01/01/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Insignia","Date Submitted":"01/03/2013 01:54 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"44984","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44984.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44984.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.660966"}
