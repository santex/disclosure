I have been interested in the UFO subject from high school. For the first time, two years ago, at around 5 am in December, I noticed a very bright fast moving light in the sky moving from north to south. From that moment I became very curious about the existence of UFOs in north of Iran also before that I also heard about a lot of UFO sightings in Iran especially the northern cities. So, I used to watch the sky a lot. When one day I saw a UFO at 6:30 p.m. I watched at the same moment the next day and to my suprise I could see again and again. I couldn't see them everyday because the sky was cloudy most of the times. During the last year I just could see the starlike UFOs which moved usually from south to north ( toward the Caspian Sea) mostly at 6:30 to 7:00 p.m..But by the start of the previous semester at November, again I used to watch the sky at 6:30 p.m.. Now to my suprise I saw new kinds of UFOs. These UFOs were flying very low at an altitude of about 200-300 meters and were very small nearly at the size of a football. These unmanned UFOs are covered with a halo of yellow-white and very dim light that they are unnoticeable and when I saw one of them for the first time I mistook it with a bird on which the light from ground was reflected, but when I saw the object several times I got it. These drones sometimes move singly or in pairs or in a triangular formation and I once saw 16 of them ( I counted) in an arrowhead formation at 6:35 p.m. and once I saw nearly 50 of them moving slowly at 1:40 a.m. towards the Caspian Sea. The late 2 months I feel more activity as I see lots of starlike and drone UFOs at 8:30 to 9 p.m..I have bought a 5mw green laser. This device helped me a lot. When I shoot the low altitude small UFOs the light reflects perfectly which shows the smoothness of the surface, and the UFO tries to dodge my shot and sometimes increases its speed. When I shoot the starlikes they immediately make their light very dim or invisible. Only one of the UFOs which I think is the same responds to the laser beam by glowing very sharply for 2 -3 seconds and later goes off. I have also seen other things for example once I saw a glowing stork which I'm sure was made of light ( like laser projection ) and surprisingly was flying like a bird ! There have been reports of some strange creatures in the Caspian sea which you can find on the net. I believe the investigation of USSR which concluded that there are some UFO bases under the waters of Caspian Sea. I wish you could come to investigate in Iran because UFO sighting is a very common and handy phenomenon in Babolsar. You should just know the time of their flight then you will see them trafficking for about 30 minutes every night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7110.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.70047,+52.64616(7110)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7110) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
