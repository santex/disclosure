I continued to watch until it was over my house and going by towards the north. I expected to see the lights on the ends of the wings as it went by thinking they were being obstructed by the headlights of the plane as it was coming towards me. It went over head making no noise and stayed bright, as it went by the light slowly dimmed out until it was gone. I would put the height as about the average altitude of a plane once it is under its flying altitude after take off. I live very close to Martins State Airport and am VERY familiar with the types of planes and normal flying lanes. This object adhered to nothing of I have seen in the skies around here before. I am also a backyard astronomist and am able to make objective decisions about objects I see in the sky."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11082009-0012","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Region":"Maryland","Longitude":"-76.609569","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Baltimore","There were no other sightings in Baltimore on or around November 8th 2009"],"Object Features":"None, Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/08/2009 06:17 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.299445","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"20384","Date Submitted":"11/08/2009 06:36 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
