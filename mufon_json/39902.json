{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn May 16, 2012, I witnessed a black triangle craft pass over head. I noticed the object when I was walking back from my car. I thought it might be a plane until I realized it made no sound and didn't seem to have a viewable form. The craft few overhead like a plane would. You could not see the actual outline of the craft since it blended into the night sky until I looked really close and could see a V. I only noticed the craft due to the main light coming from the front of the craft. There seemed to be no other lights coming from the craft. I was a little freaked out since it made no sound. I just kept looking as it passed over head. The craft disappeared from view after about one minute."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Black Triangle craft","Case Number":"39902","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-06282012-0025","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sewickley","There were no other sightings in Sewickley on or around May 16th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/16/2012 11:28 UTC","Longitude":"-80.182573","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.540127","Object Features":"Wings","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39902.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39902.html"],"City":"Sewickley","Date Submitted":"06/28/2012 11:13 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.540127,+-80.182573(39902)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39902) map </A>"}
