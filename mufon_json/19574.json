{"Object Shape":"Cone","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was wondering if anyone reported any UFO sightings in the vicinity of Greenfield, MA or Deerfield, MA last Saturday, September 19th. We were on an entrance ramp to I-91 S in Greenfield, MA at about 7:30 p.m. when we saw extremely bright lights shining downward in the sky ahead. There was a ring of bright lights just above these lights. This object appeared to be within a mile from us. I had never before seen any lights this bright coming from an object in the sky. It was stationary in sky. As we went up the ramp onto the highway there was a line of trees that blocked the view for a few seconds. When we got past the trees and could see that area of the sky again, the object was gone. All that remained was a cloud of light in the sky where we had seen this object. It looked like a cloud of gas or particles that was emitting light. My wife and son and his friend all saw this object very clearly for a few seconds before it disappeared."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Massachusetts","Summary":"Bright lights shining down from object in sky that suddenly disappeared.","Latitude":"42.594796","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19574.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19574.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Greenfield","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.594796,+-72.594684(19574)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19574) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/22/2009 09:09 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Greenfield","There were no other sightings in Greenfield on or around September 19th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"19574","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-09222009-0003","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-72.594684"}
