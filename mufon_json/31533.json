When we were able to see the city, we saw a huge orb surrounded by orangey lights hovering over and sort of behind the city. It was night and very cloudy and stormy and the orb seemed to be shrouded in a haze. It only stayed lit up for a couple seconds and then it sort of shimmered and disappeared into the night sky. It was very big and unlike anything we've ever seen before. It almost looked like a planet or the moon rising but was too big and close looking to be that."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31533.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31533.html"],"Log Number":"US-09042011-0034","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Wilkes-Barre","There were no other sightings in Wilkes-Barre on or around September 4th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/04/2011 09:47 UTC","Summary":"Saw giant glowing orb hovering above Wilkes-Barre PA","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"31533","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Wilkes-Barre","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
