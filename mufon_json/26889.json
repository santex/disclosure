I noticed a bright light white light that just appeared in the sky. It was around dusk���. So I knew it wasn���t a star; it wasn���t flashing so I knew it wasn���t a plane. It was in the sky for just a couple of seconds��� slowly became dimmer ( as if it was fading), then completely disappeared. I looked around as I was driving to see if I could see anything in the sky, but saw nothing. The sky was clear, not even a cloud existed. I still have no logical explination as to what I saw."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright light shinning","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Sterling City","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"12/08/2010 12:13 UTC"}
