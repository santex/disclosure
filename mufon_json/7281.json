{"City":"Logan","divs":["Sighting DetailsWalking the dog, looked up and observed what I would be inclined to believe were 2 TR3A's heading east in an approximate 25 degree climb about 100-200 miles apart, moving at a high rate of speed. They appeared to be making a final burn to sub-orbital altitude. Since we only have 2 TR3A's in the known inventory, and they never fly together (too valuable), I must assume I actually saw 2 ufo's. Either that, or something very strange and dangerous is afoot...The objects both stopped their burns consecutivley at the same spot in the sky, still on a climbing angle."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"2 aircraft making final burn to sub-orbital velocity","Log Number":"US-06212007-0001","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Logan","There were no other sightings in Logan on or around June 20th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/20/2007 11:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.543247,+-82.401409(7281)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7281) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-82.401409","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"7281","Date Submitted":"06/20/2007 11:15 UTC","Latitude":"39.543247","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7281.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7281.html"],"Region":"Ohio"}
