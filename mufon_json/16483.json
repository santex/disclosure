Looked up to see the beautiful night sky which filled with high, puffy clouds that were reflecting the moon and I could see a few stars here and there. My eyes quickly fell upon the typical ���spycraft��� triangle UFO. I knew it wasn���t a plane, although at first I thought it was because it had flashing lights like one. One light was white, the other red, and the other blue if I remember right. I haven���t a clue how high up it was but it seemed a bit higher than the clouds and seemed small from a distance, and it was moving about as fast as a plane. No engine sounds although that didn���t surprise me at all considering the height it appeared to be at. My assumption it was one of those spyplane things. Why it had flashing, blaring lights though when it���s supposed to be spying is beyond me! But that���s what I think it may have been as we have an Air Force base nearby."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.66481,+-117.419547(16483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16483) map </A>","Case Number":"16483","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16483.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/06/2009 11:10 UTC","Region":"Washington","Log Number":"US-04122009-0002"}
