This is not the first time I've seen the ufo in daylight on my way home from work ( driving ) in this same area. I've seen about five sightings. Surely there were other witnesses but it seems no one is saying anything. 2. what made it noticeable was that it can easily catch someone eye as it is abnormal to see a UFO stationary hovering and at the same time , very reflective metallic object as it seems. 3. A UFO , because these sightings are becoming more common. 4. Silver'ish , very reflective , stationary in the sky , ascended slightly , but mainly stationary. 5. My first reaction was ( i wish i had a high powered camera so i can zoom in on it and take clear pictures ) 6. I lost sight of the object , by it just vanishing in thin air. As it did the other times."],"Summary":"I was on the rt 208 on the way home from work when the stationary ufo apppeared","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45389.html"],"Log Number":"US-01242013-0004","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Sphere","Longitude":"-74.146725","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"01/23/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Region":"New Jersey","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"45389","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.957165","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.957165,+-74.146725(45389)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45389) map </A>"}
