It did not make any sounds but did see a plain go by 30 minutes before this abject appeared. It was going on a strait line like it was going on a mission. Did not stop just kept going. But I see many of this abject almost every night. I always go out side for a smoke and every chance I get I look up. It���s a small town and it���s not as bright as a city so you can see them."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
