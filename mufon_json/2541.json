It stayed stationary and had pulsating lights that changed while several different lights all different colors pulsated. It stayed in the same place for around 15 mins. Then slowly moved away moving to the West. I repoted seeing it to your organization last Saturday night after seeing it for the first tiime. I saw it again, while alone, on Monday 9-15-03. We have had trouble with our 8mm Sony camcorder, but I did get it on camera this time.Thanks Steven PS if you call please leave message on machine and if I'm home I will pick up I screen all calls"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
