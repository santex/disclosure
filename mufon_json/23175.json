{"Date Submitted":"05/07/2010 02:07 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWatching American idol when LOUD jet noise was heard directly over my house. Ran outside to see quick moving aircraft heading south-southeast towards a bright shining light in the sky, almost like a satellite burning up in the atmosphere. Within seconds the bright light disappeared and the military jet cut its engines. The jet headed towards the south. 10 minutes later the jet returned. FULL afterburners on, I could see the red-hot cone of a jet engine, very distinctive, no other running lights. It banked s-sw and then cut it's engines once again. Soon after I saw something high in the sky, a string of red pulsing lights shaped in a V. Moving slowly, no sound whatsoever. It lumbered overhead for several minutes before fading out of sight I didn't see the jet or anything else that night. Several hundred people called into the local sheriffs office to report it."],"Case Number":"23175","Region":"California","Tags":"City","City":"Santa Clarita","Log Number":"US-05072010-0003","Latitude":"34.395154","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Comet like star accompanied by military jet","Date of the Event":"05/04/2010 08:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23175.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23175.html"],"Longitude":"-118.539506","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.395154,+-118.539506(23175)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23175) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Santa Clarita","There were no other sightings in Santa Clarita on or around May 4th 2010"]}
