It came into my view and began hovering in the sky near the tree tops. It was tubular in shape with three white lights. The silhouette of the object was visible, as a shadow surrounding the lights. The three lights were all in a row..white. Then out of no where it disappeared in a very bright flash, a definite ascension upwards. We also heard a \"puff\" sound, very similar to when you first turn on your gas grill!! I don't know what it was, but it was a craft of some sort. Very strange indeed!"],"Region":"California","City":"Carlsbad","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-12082012-0010","Date Submitted":"12/08/2012 02:52 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Three lights appeared and then a flash of light!","Latitude":"33.132337","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.324527","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"44403","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Carlsbad","There were no other sightings in Carlsbad on or around December 7th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.132337,+-117.324527(44403)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44403) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/07/2012 12:00 UTC"}
