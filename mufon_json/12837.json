{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsLooking west at Lake Michigan. Approximately 9:40 p.m. Object with red and green flashing lights seen in the distance. Object was too low to be a star and since it hovered for almost 40 minutes, it couldn't be a plane. Used binoculars to see the object, which appeared circular. The red and green lights continuously flashed. At one point, a bright white light flashed in the sky near the aircraft. Aircraft hovered in the same position for about 40 minutes, eventually moving south toward the lake, then disappearing. Seemed to be hovering over the water, not over land."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12837.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12837.html"],"Longitude":"-86.519465","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Stevensville","There were no other sightings in Stevensville on or around September 27th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"09/27/2008 09:20 UTC","Case Number":"12837","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/27/2008 09:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-09292008-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Sphere","City":"Stevensville","Tags":"City","Summary":"Red and green flashing lights on hovering aircraft; short, bright light accompanied aircraft sighting","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.014487,+-86.519465(12837)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12837) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"Michigan","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"42.014487"}
