When I was 18 (May of 1978) I began experiencing a series of phenomena that resulted in extreme psychological trauma. It would take many pages to relate all that occurred, but basically, myself and a couple of friends came to the conclusion that the world was about to end. We came to this conclusion simultaneously, albeit independently, without ever having had discussed anything like this hitherto. Ever. We were happy-go-lucky pothead musicians. Period. One thing that helped solidify in our minds that we were indeed being warned by \"something\" about the imminent end of the world was when a friend of ours offered to read tarot cards for us. I didn't have a clue as to what that was all about (I was a devout atheist and Darwinist at the time)but I figured, uh, go for it. Interestingly, this girl drew the tarot cards twice and they came up exactly the same each time (except for one card the nature of which was significant in and of itself). The cards' message (at least according to her interpretation) basically confirmed our newfound apocalyptic fears. Mind you, she wasn't even sure if she believed all of this herself. At this time I was befriended by a 30 something women who offered to make stage clothes for me, as I was playing in a band. I told her about my experiences and she believed me!!!!!! She told me something apocalyptic was in fact imminent and that she had seen lights in the sky (i.e., UFO's). Being a Von Daniken buff, I had already concluded that whatever was warning my friends and I about doomsday must be extraterrestrial beings from a technologically advanced civilization. One evening in June of 78 (shortly after my 19th birthday) this women called me up and told me to come over to her apartment, as the lights in the sky were going to show up that night. She didn't call them UFO's - she called them \"the powers that be.\" I went over to her apartment and hung out with her and her 3 kids. I did not indulge in any substances that evening. Clich���-like, at 12am, half hanging out of her 4rth story window looking out into the night sky, I saw a bright white orb appear out of thin air and begin to slowly move across the sky. I yelled to my friend that the UFO's were here. She was not surprised in the least. Myself, this lady and her 14 year old son went to the roof of the building and watched these lights appear out of nowhere, travel slowly and silently or hover. We saw planes go by - they didn't appear to be planes. At one point, 2 of them merged and sank below the Manhattan skyline. After about a half an hour, her son decided to go back to the apartment as it was a chilly evening and he was apparently used to seeing these things. I thought he was nuts - this was the most monumental moment of my life and he was complaining about the cold!!!!! After about an hour, they all disappeared and none reappeared. I sat there with her on the roof for a few minutes after this spectacle ended in utter disbelief when all of a sudden a bright white light engulfed us for a few seconds. I asked my friend if she had seen this and she calmly said yes. She had tried taking photographs of the lights but nothing appeared in the developed photos. I didn't think to call the police or check the newspaper the following day, but I didn't hear about any sightings. I was in shock after the sighting but my friend said that it was no big deal - she saw them all the time in the daytime and nighttime. I should add, if it makes any difference, that she was a devoted follower of Alistair Crowley's teachings. She and her kids often experienced strange occultic phenomena (e.g., apparitions in her apartment, her camera, only after falling off of a table by itself would subsequently take pictures of auras). I began to read the Old Testament, as, being raised Jewish, was the only book I had ever heard of that talked about supernatural events and I had to find an answer to all of this. During the summer and fall of 78, many bizarre poltergeist types of experiences became commonplace for me. I was in a state of constant fear and confusion and could find no answers as to what was happening. During midsummer, I told my drummer's wife about these events and she gave me a copy of the New Testament. Me, a nice Jewish boy from Queens started reading the Christian bible. At the time, it seemed to fulfill a need that I had for objective morality, although I couldn't quite figure out what the heck the main message was. Eventually, I began to question the goodness of the \"powers\" that were essentially driving me nuts!!! One biblical passage in the book of Ephesians states that our enemies are not flesh and blood, but the spiritual powers that reside in the heavens. I connected this with the lights that I had, by this time, been seeing on a regular basis (other people I knew had seen them as well). Very long story short: in the fall of 78 I had an epiphany of sorts and was convinced that demons were plaguing me and that Jesus had died for my sins. I heard a voice in my belly (!!) tell me this during a particularly scary poltergeist-type moment. Immediately after this happened, I experienced a peace that I had never felt from pot and booze. I felt completely elated for a couple of days. I was friggin' floating!!!! Although I couldn't deny what I had experienced, after a few years I fell away from the Christian church. I did so for a number of reasons: 1) I couldn't come to grips with the many discrepancies found in the bible. 2) It seemed that there was no agreement amongst the various Christian denominations. How can truth be truth if no one agrees what the hell it is? 3) I was a very horny young man. I prayed unceasingly to god to take my lust away from me to no effect. 4) The concept of hell, the advocacy of misogyny, slavery and genocide found in the bible was abhorrent to me. As the years have passed since that time, I have become increasingly jaded re: faith in god. Until last year, I was a child welfare worker for 11 years. For 11 years I dealt with neglected and abused kids and their dead beat parents. The evils and injustice of life continually ate away at me, making me more hateful towards god than I had ever been as an atheistic teenager. On an intellectual if not emotional level, I simply could not believe in a benevolent god. What torments me now is, despite the fact that I cannot believe in the god of the bible or a benevolent god in general, I still to this day cannot deny the things I experienced in my late teens and early 20's. Were the lights in the sky and subsequent spooky experiences (e.g., knocks on the wall, lights flickering when I seemingly had a key thought, an out of body experience, etc.) simply hallucinations or caused by something out there? At age 47 I still can't figure it out."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around June 30th 1978"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6676.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6676.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
