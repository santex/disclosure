{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting Detailsmy husband was in the Air Force and was picking me up from work. we stopped in our car and so did many other cars. We stopped to stare at for more than 15 minutes. We were very young and didn't know quite what we were looking at. We never got out of our car. We were somewhat scared but were transfixed by the sight of it. It was awesome looking. It never made a sound and we had our windows open. The next day my husband heard a lot of talk about it being near one of the missle sites.We eventually drove on home, but we never forgot the sight of it to this day. It seems like it was yesterday. We know it was a UFO. No doubt about it. We have never had a doubt about it ever since. we first noticed it because it was hoving right over the main thoroughfare. approx. 150-200 ft. in the air. you would have almost had to have been blind not to notice it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11232.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11232.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-93.72632","Date Submitted":"11/30/1964 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-06192008-0009","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/30/1964 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Warrensburg","There was one other sighting in Warrensburg on or around November 30th 1964"],"Latitude":"38.768979","City":"Warrensburg","Case Number":"11232","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"UFO was visiting Whiteman AFB, but we saw it in the middle of the day","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.768979,+-93.72632(11232)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11232) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
