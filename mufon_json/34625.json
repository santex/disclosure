It took less than 30 seconds to pass over the entire night sky. Estimated speed 15,000-50,000 mph. the path was a little wobbled in kind of a slight zigzag movement. I thought it could be a satellite except it wasn't moving in a straight line.It was so high up it looked like another star. It had no flashing lights like a plane would. I live near the airport so no planes are ever that high up and never move that fast or in a zigzag pattern like this one did.Moved way too fast and was too high up to be a jet. Moved too slow and erratic to be a comet or satellite.I am going back outside to watch for others. I felt like It was ignoring me, unlike my last sighting in 1982 when I saw the boomerang craft up close in Hudson valley,NY. That time I felt like they knew I was watching."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"01/05/2012 08:47 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/05/2012 05:30 UTC"}
