We thought it was just lightning at the time until it started changing colors and gradually fading from one color to another. It would flash in patterns, then randomly. We couldn't see the object itself, but i never seen lightning do anything like that before. It lasted for about a minute and i ran inside the house to grab my mom, but when we came outside, my girlfriend informed us that it had stopped. We were both pretty amazed at what we had witnessed and wish we knew exactly what it was."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/17/2011 10:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/17/2011 11:09 UTC"}
