They are sun lit and disappear as it gets darker. Looking through my basic Orion 4\" telesope, they appeared cylyndrical in shape. My wife observed the lower one manuver towards upper one, then move laterally across my house, and disappear at a great speed(silent) I saw the same the next evening. It appeared back at it's original position under the upper one. They have been here a month and have heard any news about them from our local new's etc. I'm hoping that some one in the Phoenix area has looked at them as well. Or maybe someone else should look at them. I live in Maricopa, south of Phoenix, so someone has had to report them at some point. Could Mufon shed any light on this sighting? Kevin P. Moran (going nuts trying to figure these two objects out.
