It was so fast and happened so quickly that I could not get the cam or the phone to take any pictures, and it didnt last long, no sounds or anything, just a blue light for few seconds, crossing the sky very fast, it crossed it what looked to me in a descending way, going down, and as if u blew on the candle, no more light and that was it !"],"City":"Quincy","Date Submitted":"06/18/2008 01:20 UTC","Summary":"It was blue color, flashing, very fast and didnt last long","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11209.html"],"Longitude":"-70.99358","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Quincy","There were no other sightings in Quincy on or around June 18th 2008"]}
