{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile going on the patio to smoke a ciggarette, Me and my sister noticed two flashing lights that we thought were maybe airplanes but never moved, all of a sudden they both dissapeared right before our eyes and then we saw flashes in other parts of the sky, but only this time the star-like objects were moving and at the same time dissapearing.
