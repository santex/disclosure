When i walked on my front porch, i saw three lights that were not consistent with aircraft, almost like an orange-blue color, above a barren tree in my neighbors yard north west of my front door, but the lights stayed still and did not move. It was a clear winter night. It was at a fairly low altitude and i watched the lights for roughly 30 minutes before they vanished before my eyes. I was absolutely dumbfounded by what I saw. I had never seen anything like it before in my life, and told my father about it later that night. I have always wondered about the incident, but thought nothing of it until this morning when I saw Chris Bledsoe saw the same thing around the same time. What astonished me even more is that Fayetteville is an hour away from Rockingham. There are many aircraft I have seen fly over the house before, but nothing like what I saw that night."],"City":"Rockingham","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26974.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26974.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"I went outside to let dogs out and saw lights hovering above a tree behind my neighbors house.","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"26974","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/31/2006 08:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.94653,+-79.771456(26974)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26974) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Rockingham","There were no other sightings in Rockingham on or around December 31st 2006"]}
