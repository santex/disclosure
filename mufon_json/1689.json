It was about 2100 and a clear night. I noticed three lightsapproaching out of the west heading from the general area of Spirit of St Louistowards downtown, roughly parallel with Highway 40. The lights were flying in atriangular pattern, with one in front and two in the rear. They were flashingtogether, and the distance between them never changed. I assumed it was only athousand feet high or so, because of the size. I guessed it was about the samealtitude as other planes that approach or depart Spirit. However, there wasabsoloutely no noise at all. The lights glided from west to east and finallydisappeared towards Lambert. If the object was any convential aircraft that washigh enough in altitude to be out of earshot, it would have had to be the sizeof an aircraft carrier."],"Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Log Number":"","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/15/2002 09:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"02/15/2002 09:00 UTC","City":"Chesterfield","Country":"United States","Case Number":"1689","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.663108","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Triangular lights.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1689.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1689.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-90.577068","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
