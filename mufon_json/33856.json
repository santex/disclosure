We came driving up a hill and I noticed a light above the car that drawed my attention I looked up and I saw a dark object maybe 20-30ft in size and within 50-75ft above the car. It was in the shape of an oval and had lights coming from the bottom which shined the normal color, but the object itself was a grayish blue color with a definate shape and did not have wings of any sort. It seemed to hover for a split second then shoot directly over the car and when I looked out the back window as we passed it was gone. I kinda screamed like a girl to be honest then was like holy **** I think I just saw a UFO. It definatly wasn't an aircraft that we have that the public is made aware of that much I do know."]}
