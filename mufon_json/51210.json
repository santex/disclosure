Pretty soon another went by, then a clear small sphere with a white band around the middle came past. All were at same speed and height. There were a few more that went by for a total of 6 or so. I was alarmed at first. They appeared to be moving as fast as a jet. They moved strait across the sky both directions NW to SE and SE to NW cruising along at an even speed, silent and with no change of direction. I thought they were drones but then I thought UFOs. This went o n for an hour."]}
