I`ve experienced paranormal acivity most of my life, but the last year in 2 separate events things have become physical . January 29th 2013 I went to bed @ 2am and woke up @ shortly after 6am , ran my hands through my hair and felt a clump of something , I pulled my hand down and it was covered in blood and a bit of hair , totally shocked I angled the medicine cabinet mirror into the bathroom mirror and bent over backwards to get a look at what the blood was coming from . When I saw I almost fell to my knees , there was a perfect large Y shaped incision on the top of my head !? I live alone , and in no possible way could have or would have done this to myself . I have documeted the healing of the Y scar by taking photos every other day , and I still can`t believe it when I look into the mirror and see it ontop of my head, but it`s all too real. If anyone knows someone I can talk to or send all of my data to please let me know. Thanks ."],"Country":"Canada","Case Number":"45861","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45861.html"],"Log Number":"CA-02242013-0010"}
