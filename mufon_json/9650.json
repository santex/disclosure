To the (what seemed to be) east we noticed a very large object high in the sky. The object appeared to be coming down at an angle towards the north and moving away toward the east at the same time. It looked like a ball of churning light colored smoke, followed by a long smoke trail. At the same time we were watching this we saw a smoke trail of a smaller dark object shaped like a ���cigar��� or ���rocket��� shoot up toward the first object, pass near it and continue upward arcing away east or north east. This one had a smoke trail that seemed to split then join together. We were on the freeway and so impressed with the size that I had to pull over and was surprised that no one else seemed to notice. Also that it did not seem to have an impact to the ground. I have a person that I referred to from Madison who ruled out comets or asteroids. We tried to get pictures, but of course, camera failure. There might be one on the camera phone. Was something having a landing problem, crashing? Honestly, our feelings were of fear. Of what we weren't sure. We just knew we were watching something unusual. *We did get a picture on the phone but it seems faint and appears much farther away"],"Case Number":"9650","Tags":"City","Latitude":"44.936905","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar, Unknown"}
