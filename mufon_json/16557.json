They were about at the height of a helicopter and the three orbs were flying in slight triangular formation, but not fully in sync as one or two would wobble out of formation briefly. Clearly, I knew it was not a aircraft with no flashing lights. I see planes fly above from SFO everyday and the orbs were white, but not a star-bright type of light nor were they twinkling. I knew immediately as I saw them that they were not birds or planes or evening a comet or shooting star and they produced no noise. I've seen the difference of all of that at night and I am also not a big firm believer in UFOs, but still don't know what I saw in those three orbs."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were no other sightings in San Francisco on or around April 16th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.77841,+-122.416846(16557)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16557) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-122.416846","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-04172009-0016","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"00:00:07","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
