{"Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"4461","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy daughter, my two granddaughters and i were returning from a restaraunt. We were northbound on the west part of Great Bend,Ks, I looked to the right and saw 4 orange lights in the eastern sky. I thought they may have been on grain bins. Just then my daughter who, lives there said what are those lights. She had never seen them before. They appeared to be 3 or 4 hundred feet high. They looked to be in a straight horizonal line at first, but as we tried to get closer the 2 center ones appeared slightly lower. As we tried to get closer. The trees and houses blocked our view. Then they were gone. The next morning the local radio said there had been numerous reports to the sheriff and police depts. One lady observed 2 then 6 then 4 lights. Then they were gone. I emailed the Great Bend paper, but haven`t heard anything back."],"Longitude":"-98.764807","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.364457,+-98.764807(4461)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4461) map </A>","Latitude":"38.364457","Date Submitted":"02/14/2006 08:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4461.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"4 orange lights","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Tags":"City","City":"Great Bend","Region":"Kansas","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Great Bend","There were no other sightings in Great Bend on or around February 14th 2006"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/14/2006 08:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02202006-0005"}
