(source: wikipedia.de ; http:\\\\de.wikipedia.org\\wiki\\hausen_am_albis ) looking to the airsports end. ########################################################################### hello, [~17:19] i was at my window of my house and looked out of my window. it rained, but it was a realy special rain-day, because the clouds and the lighting conditions are very nice \\ butefull. so i want to make a picture out of my window with my mobile phone. [~17:00] befor, i was in my house and making some pictures in the house. but my handy doesnt save the pictures dont know why. but i think that not realy have to do with a ufo or something. [~17:18] after, i see a round little point (little because the mobile phone screen isnt big) wich looks like a silver or gray, from older times, like from the 1960s or older or somthing (if you know the story about german world war 2 ufos, like this color http:\\\\www.nrg.co.il\\images\\archive\\408x322\\577\\086.jpg). the object not realy shone (not \"bling bling\"). i see the object only with my handy camera. i cant see it with my eye (i readet about the phenomen). i was shot a picture but my handy doesnt save it, dont know why but i think that not realy have to do with a ufo or something. [~17:20] restartet my mobile phone. with some startup problems because the start button sucks or something. [17:23] shot the first picture. dsc00371.jpg [17:23] shot the second picture. dsc00372.jpg the \"ufo\" were littler, think it \"fly\" away (think the sky were a lil bit darker <- my sun reflaction therory) [17:23] shot the last picture. dsc00373.jpg all in one, the \"ufo\" dont moved higher \\ lower. i dont heard what from the \"ufo\". it was a \"fix\" point in the sky. i dont think that that is a ufo, i think thats a sun-reflection to my handy camera. so, whats strange if you look at the first picture you see a \"star\" or sun-\"star\"-reflection. mayby a alien moves arround or something :) or engine \"smoke\" or \"rader scanner\" or something. i say again, i dont think that that a ufo is, i want send you the pictures because i think thats just a sun-reflaction and i want help u to filter out fakes or those sight phenomens. i have the orginal fotos on my mobile-phone (no worry about fakes or something :)). ################# if you have questions about the \"signt\" or some geographic things, just ask me, i like storys about ufos, aliens, stuff like this. i hope i helped you all, and sorry for my bad english. please contact me want to know what you think about, pascal g. warrick@gmx.ch (secondary email)"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"8.550002","Log Number":"CH-02262007-0005","Case Number":"6464"}
