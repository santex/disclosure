{"Longitude":"-83.480269","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was just returning from a walk at night when at about 9:30 PM, I saw a white UFO almost straight above me or to the west. I would guess the altitude to be between 70 and 90 degrees above the horizon. I thought it was a satellite at first. I lost sight of it at about 9:35 PM or 9:40 PM or so, but when I lost sight of it, it was still at high altitude, to the north, at about 45 degrees above the horizon. I looked at a satellite passing chart at www.heavens-above.com for sightings above magnitude 5.0, but no objects listed fit what I saw."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/04/2013 09:35 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"50435","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","City":"Northville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown, N/A","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"sattelite UFO","Latitude":"42.433636","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.433636,+-83.480269(50435)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50435) map </A>","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Northville","There were no other sightings in Northville on or around September 4th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other,N/A","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/04/2013 10:31 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50435.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50435.html"],"Log Number":"US-09042013-0025"}
