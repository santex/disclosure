If you enlarge picture #3 you can see where another picture has been inserted. In the insert one can see a vertical tube like structure with two \"legs\" (just to the left of the raccoon). This \"structure\" isn't in the day shot but it appears in all of the night pictures and it remains the same size in all three pictures..So, it's doubted this is some alien object approaching the camera. The 3rd night picture when enlarged clearly shows a square edged insert whose color does not match the rest of the picture."],"Date Submitted":"06/05/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06162008-0011","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.577842","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.558803,+-72.577842(11193)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11193) map </A>","Summary":"Vermont scout camera pictures appear altered","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Vermont","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"Country":"United States"}
