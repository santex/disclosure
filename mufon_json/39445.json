I then heard a nosie and saw another aircraft with two blinking red lights following behind it about 15 seconds after I saw the object. The sound of the engines on the blinking red light plane was clear of that of a fighter jet. I saw the orb continue to the side of my house and it then vanished with the fighter jet continuing on a path to where it was last located. I also captured another aircraft shortly after on the same flight pattern with very odd green lights on it moving very fast."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39445.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39445.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.731275"}
