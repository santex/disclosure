It was a perfectly clear night in Santa Cruz and the stars looked fantastic. I have been gazing up into the stars for many years and have seen my share of meteorites, meteors, and satellites. We both noticed a rather bright star that appeared be moving at a consistent velocit y across the sky. Its brightness appeared to be about equal to that of the brightest object in the sky that evening, most likely some planet. However, this moving object quickly faded out and disappeared. I have never seen any sattelite do anything like this before. About 15 mins later I indentified what I thought was a sattelite combing across the sky. Again, the object (slightly less bright than the previous), appeared to move at a constant velocity and we were able to watch it as I moved several degrees across the sky. All the sudden, the object instantly disappeared. Once again, the sky was completely clear that evening and it is not possible that any clouds could have obstructed our view. We were unable to see the object further down its trajectory at a later time as well. After thinking about these sightings in great detail, I cannot fully explain what I saw, the objects moved too slowly to be any sort of meteor or smaller. It could be possible that we viewed some military missile testing, but I do not know of any way of checking their schedule. This could be a possible explanation."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7461.html"],"Longitude":"-122.028596","Latitude":"36.982717","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"07/15/2007 10:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07162007-0007","Object Features":"Unknown"}
