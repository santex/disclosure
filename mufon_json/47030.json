We went in the house to get the zoom camera and the binoculars. The camera was of no help at all the screen was black... But the binoculars showed a spectacular light show. Flashing colors - red blue green, yellow white in not apparent order. The object changed from the triangular shape to a more spherical shape. My husband noticed it move to the south but after about a half an hour it was moving to the north. We called the CHP to make note of the event and were very soon contacted by a volunteer from the National UFO center Ethan Davenport. He was very polite and suggested that it might be sirius. We will be checking again tomorrow night."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"04/28/2013 02:06 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Paso Robles","There were no other sightings in Paso Robles on or around April 27th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47030.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47030.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"flashing lights various colors not distinct order random flashing","Log Number":"US-04282013-0002","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"35.70844","Sighting Duration":"01:08:11","City":"Paso Robles","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City"}
