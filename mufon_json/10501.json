I noticed nothing on the screen at the time because I was moving back and forth between monitor and scope. But on playback I noticed something move across the monitor which at first I thought was a bug. But it was recorded and I played it many times trying to figure out what it was. After checking around with friends they told me it was not the space shuttle. It had a sort of triangle shape and seemed to be doing barrel rolls. I was told that the shuttle doesen't do barrel rolls. I have the vhs tape in my possession. No one else seemed to be interested in it so it sat. If you want to see video send me an address and I will."],"Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/31/1998 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-85.599234","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Recorded on vhs tape","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.322814,+-85.599234(10501)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10501) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"44.322814","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/31/1998 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
