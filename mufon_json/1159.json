Secondly in Calif.a very interesting object appeared every night atapprox. 9:30 with some very interesting routines (all the same) for a period ofweeks. I have never written this down as it is best told in person as to me itis unbelievable. No I was not sucked up or anything so flambouyant, but a veryunusual occurance happened twice! Not to long ago I was watching show on TVabout UFOs and throughout the program I felt like had a lot to contribute inthe way of information to some of the questions they were asking.
