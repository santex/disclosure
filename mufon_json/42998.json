Noticed the object as the sunlight appeared to reflect off of it. At first, I thought the object was a cloud. Then I noticed that it appeared to have substance and a constant shape. It was hovering. I then noticed that there appeared to be a trail leading up to the object. That trail became more and more visible as the sighting continued. I invited several of my coworkers to observe it. We were all somewhat mystified and mesmerized by it. Didnt lose sight of it until I had to leave the building for the day."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Los Angeles","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around October 2nd 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Date of the Event":"10/02/2012 06:30 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Case Number":"42998","Longitude":"-118.41768","Date Submitted":"10/03/2012 02:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"34.055788","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42998.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42998_submitter_file1__wtf1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42998_submitter_file2__wtf2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42998.html"],"Log Number":"US-10032012-0012","Summary":"{dr}strange object(s) observed at sunset"}
