It moved for about 2 seconds in a straight line, I said do you see that? and the light was gone. This is an area near WrightPatt AFB. I didn't see any planes or other aircraft around. I thought it might have been a RC craft, but the light was so bright it didn't seem like a natural RC. It seemed circular although I couldn't really tell any object shape but to say the light itself was the shape. I would like to know if anyone else saw the same thing."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Fairborn","There were no other sightings in Fairborn on or around March 9th 2013"],"Latitude":"39.815976","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"46138","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Very bright circular light observed while it moved in horizontal line, then went out","City":"Fairborn","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46138.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46138.html"],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-84.011054","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
