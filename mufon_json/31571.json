At first i thought it was merely sunlight glinting off an airplane. But as i watched i noticed that the craft was not following a directional path like an airplane. The object was bobbing and meandering, turning left and right and up and down. I watched more and saw that the object was actually emitting flashing white lights from either underneath or all around the bottom edge. The flashing light pattern would change from rapid flash to slow pulse. It disappeared in some clouds. I watched further to see it again and it reappeared a moment later continuing its same behavior. At this time i called to my friend in the house to come out and see. We watched together for about twenty seconds. It disappeared and came back again for another minute before disappearing for good."],"Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.903247,+-118.077673(31571)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31571) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09062011-0002","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Norwalk","There were no other sightings in Norwalk on or around September 5th 2011"],"City":"Norwalk","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Disc, Flash"}
