{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI came out of work going to my vehicle and I looked up to the sky towards the east. There was a bright light between two stars that looked like a planet. Then it started moving slowly toward the east. I went back into work and got a couple of co-workers to come out and see this. As we watched it kept moving toward the east and picked speed alittle bit and then started fading into a dim orangess light and faded away. One guy said it was a plane but I told him there wasn't any flashing lights on it like the rest of the planes going by PLUS planes don't have that bright of lights on the rear,since it was moving away from us. Now mind you there was several planes going and they all have the same bright landing lights on the front and the flashing light on their wings. This object was much higher and moving away from us not towards us and no flashing lights. Thats what we saw. Thank you."],"Case Number":"13879","Log Number":"US-11212008-0018","Longitude":"-90.32456","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13879.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13879.html"],"Country":"United States","City":"Maplewood","Date of the Event":"11/21/2008 05:42 UTC","Region":"Missouri","Latitude":"38.612552","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.612552,+-90.32456(13879)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13879) map </A>","Summary":"A bright light moving east away from us then faded out.","Date Submitted":"11/21/2008 05:42 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Maplewood","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Other"}
