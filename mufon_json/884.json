HopeChurch Rd. (Exit 130). Ahead, approx. a mile or more and just above the treeline to the right of the interstate, a very bright blob of light suddenly got myattention. (Much larger than apparent size of Planet Venus at night.) It hadpositioned itself directly below and in line with the early morning sun. Sunapprox. 15 deg. above horizon. Object about 8 deg. Background cirrus cloudsprovided good viewing conditions. But no dark sihouette to reveal shape ofcraft. Entire craft totally engulfed in what appeared to be its own reflectionof sunlight (same exact color). Compensating for my own motion, I found objectwas in hover somewhere between 1,000-2,000 ft. altitude approx. 1 to 2 milesdistance at approx. azimuth of 110 degrees"],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Greensboro","There were no other sightings in Greensboro on or around October 17th 2000"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.076885,+-79.789735(884)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (884) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","City":"Greensboro","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
