I am about to turn off the lights, and go to sleep, it was a good, day at work, a good evening at home. I did not have the usual stressors from my emotions or work related issues. It was a calm and ���connected��� evening. I turn off the light and no sooner as I hit my head on the pillow I was taken from my home in what felt like an immediate whirl wind. I was taken to what appeared to be a remote area on a highway. I looked beyond the horizon and saw it was evening. But it appeared so bright around me. I am standing on a highway with what I can see is a house to my right, and a tree in front of me. They seem bright, and the street lane below my feet. I then look up and see a large UFO hovering above me, I was prettified. Its outer shell was very white like bright as if glowing. It had some other lights underneath it, blue, red, and yellow-no sound. I am scared my heart is racing. I look to the right side of me and there is standing a male figure, hybrid reptilian being. He looked half human half lizard. In a telepathic message he says ���Someone wants to meet you.��� We walk left towards a red van. The window is open, another hybrid in the van, He says ���This is Jayson, my heart is racing, I am in the space of fear, looking up the UFO craft follows our every move as its now over us and the van-no sound. The being looks at me and says telepathically, ���If you love nature so much why are you destroying it.��� After he told me this I was back in my bed-disconnected from the experience. I attempted to re-engage but it was my own human fear that broke the connection. That was in 2008- his first message: 1- If you love nature so much why are you destroying it. Second visitation 2009-Non- Abduction-Telepathic engagement: This time again I was preparing for bed, when my brain felt as if it was ���tapped into���, it was Jayson I knew it was him. I asked him ���where are you,��� he said in a craft near by. I felt distinctly I was not to be taken again due to the extreme fear I had experience during our prior experience. He reported he came back to finish what he wanted to tell me in 2008. CASE REPORT FILE #0208-09 Jayson���s Eleven Points of Wisdom. 2- Love God with all your might all your soul, We Love God too. 3- Others may not come in peace. 4- You are descendents of another race. 5- They are jealous of Us because there are more of Us than there of them. 6- The Reptilians are more advanced We come in Peace. 7- All disease is created in the mind, thought of in the mind. 8- The cure is in the mind 9- God is evolution, He creates that���s all He does, and everything else creates itself.

We encountered them in the desert, they accepted Our teachings. They became children of the ���light��� because they accepted the wisdom taught to them.��� This was the last I heard from him. I do not know or clearly understand all of this, although he did give me reasoning behind each statement. After our last encounter, I woke up one evening to a large luminescent orb over looking my bed. It was a little bigger than a basket ball. It hovered, bright light, then in an instant it shot left out of the window- It was closed."],"Latitude":"40.723463","Log Number":"US-06032012-0017","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-73.998193","Tags":"City","Summary":"Abducted","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"New York","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
