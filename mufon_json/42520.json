I yelled for my room mate and he came out and saw the same formation. They were in two vertical lines and moving more toward us. I told my roommate to get his camera but then the objects began to get duller. By the time he came out they had really faded. He tried to get some pics but nothing really to see at that point. We are both professionals and have never seen or reported anything like this before. You really can't call the police so this seems like the only alternative."],"Date Submitted":"09/13/2012 12:20 UTC","Case Number":"42520","Region":"Connecticut","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Milford","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/12/2012 11:11 UTC"}
