{"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsEither I saw 6 Satellites in 10 minutes or something strange was going on. They were all going in different directions 5 of the 6 looked like stars but one of them looked alot lower and had a brighter light source to it. I was out in my frontyard just looking up at the sky and didn't realize my father was out in the driveway and he also saw these. I came in then he came in (not realizing he was outside) I said to him I saw a bunch of satellites up in the sky at once and he replied back with is that what those were? I had no idea he was also outside looking at the same things."],"Date Submitted":"08/02/2009 10:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Abilene","Summary":"Strange","Longitude":"-99.729044","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18450.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18450.html"],"Case Number":"18450","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/02/2009 10:30 UTC","Latitude":"32.449836","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were no other sightings in Abilene on or around August 2nd 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.449836,+-99.729044(18450)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18450) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Log Number":"US-08022009-0015","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
