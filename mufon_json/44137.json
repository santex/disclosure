{"City":"Sherwood Park","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I have videoed ufo's in the past and had about 7 close encounters I have my combination scope, night vision and camera set up and ready to go. It is winter in Alberta so the skies are usually overcast. Saturday morning I got up for a glass of water at about 3AM and looked outside. The skies were crystal clear. I turned on my equipment and caught 2 orbs passing over Sherwood Park headed for the town of Camrose. In the fisrt video the ufo glows very bright as if to say, \"I see you watching me.\""],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Log Number":"CA-11252012-0007","Longitude":"-113.266964","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"44137","Date Submitted":"11/25/2012 01:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/24/2012 03:00 UTC","Latitude":"53.529005","Region":"Alberta","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Sherwood Park","There were 2 other sightings in Sherwood Park on or around November 24th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.529005,+-113.266964(44137)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44137) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"Canada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44137.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44137.html"],"Summary":"UFO's flying over Sherwood Park toward Camrose","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
