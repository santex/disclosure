{"divs":["sighting detailssummary report written by dan wright on july 27, 1983at 2:30 am, friday, july 22, 1983, the author received a telephone referal fromtrooper ______ of the flint post, michigan state police. the post had receivedtwo calls five minutes apart after 1 am from the flushing area west of flint. both concerned an aerial object at treetop level over the countryside. unfortunately, the latter caller gave a previous address and phone number,rendering followup impossible. trooper ____ was dispatched and visited theresidence of ______, who had witnessed the event with her 11 y\\o son ___ andtheir guests, ____ of flint and her 11 y\\o daughter ____. the trooperquestioned the four and also two consumers power company lineman who wererepairing a downed wire at the site. all power in the vicinity had been outsince 8 pm thursday. the lineman had arrived at 12:50 am, ten minutes beforethe sighting. their presence seems to have had a bearing on the events, as willbe further explained. on his return to the post, trooper _____ contacted mufon,giving his impression that the witnesses were honest and relating their account. an appointment was set for that evening. the ___ residence is one of severalnew homes in an area still basically agricultural, with cornfields and woodspredominant. it is also on an east-west flight path of bishop internationalairport, located file miles away. areas south and southwest of flint haveelicited several ufo reports over the past years. _____ and her daughter hadarrived for a visit thursday evening and, when the power was interupted bythunderstorm activity, decided to remain until it was restored. when theconsumers truck arrived, all four proceeded to the front porch to observe. tenminutes later, ____ was locating constellations when she noticed two oversizedwhite lights hovering over a tree between two houses a hundred yards to thenortheast. she called the others attention and the four stared at the lightsfor two to three minutes. at that point, they were stationary and no soundemitted from the source. each light was about two feet in diameter, and the twowere positioned closely. the witnesses found it odd that such large beacons didnot appreciably illuminate the surroundings or irritate their eyes with aglaring effect. at this point, the consumers vehicle was maneuvering into aditch to reach the utility pole with its elevated cradle. one of the men stoodbehind, directing the other. according to the witnesses, the truck then struckthe pole accidently, and the lights immediately rose up slightly, then went out. now they could identify the object as a domed disk with red lights above andbelow where the lights had shone, circling the dome and base. the craft mayhave been rotating or, since the witnesses did not notice the extinguishedheadlamps revolving, a movie-marquee effect may have offered the appearance ofrotation. the vehicle began to slowly approach the witnesses before abruptlyturning ninety degrees to the left (south). it then glided across the road andover a field to a smallish woods two hundred yards distant. ____ focused herattention on a band of shiny metal around the girth of the object, and allreported at least two sets of prongs (i.e. an inverted \"v\" consisting of tworods about six feet in length, extending from the perimeter of the underside.) these were also bright metallic. according to the children, the \"prongs\"started to protrude from the vehicle only after it was in motion and heading forthe woods. mary believed she spotted four such sets and assumed them to belanding gear. the others noticed only two sets, one under the headlamps, theother positioned opposite. the group agreed that the object had a very lightand fairly low-pitched \"whirling\" sound while in motion. this, they remarked,was unlike that of an airplane or helicopter and was otherwise unrecognizable. when either above or slightly beyond the wooded area (which extends for roughly150 yards), the object glided down in a vertical descent until lost from viewbelow the treeline. its path had carried the craft to the side and behind theutility employees, but neither realized its presence. the four witnessesmaintained a vigil for nearly an hour afterward, however no reappearance was tooccur. _______ and ______ used the terms \"mesmerized\" and \"awe\" to describetheir reactions to the anomoly, stating that they seemed compelled to watch asit hovered nearby. this may of course have been quite naturally a psychologicalresponse but bears mentioning. the witnesses are quite certain that the utilitytruck did not experience any sort of disruption to its lights or engine. as theneighborhoods power was off, no other electrical disturbances could haveoccurred. the family dog, a spaniel-collie mix, had begun pacing, barking in anunfriendly manner, and investigating windows and doors shortly before thesighting. during the episode, it barked continously, though this may have beendue to the presence of the utility truck. after the incident, it hid in thebasement and refused to answer its owners calls. the following day, ______remarked, it was acting somewhat strangely, resting behind furniture normallyunfrequented and acting timid generally. following interviews with the fourwitnesses, the author spent considerable time in and around the wooded area inquestion. very few openings existed whereby a craft of the size described(larger in diameter than a full-sized auto) could have landed without breakingtree limbs, and no ground markings or vegetation scorched or swirled was found. the cornfield which lies beyond the woods contained several bare spots, butagain no indication of dehydration, compacting, scorching, or swirling of thecrop was evident. several neighbors along both _____ and ___ roads were queriedregarding the incident, only one offering a possible insight. _____ who livesacross and diagonally from the ____ residence, was awakened by her husband whophoned from his workplace to notify her that police had been sent to the area,ostensibly regarding a fire according to his second-hand information via cb. later the same night, at about 5 am, she awoke again to the strong odor of aburnt substance of some sort. she could offer no explanation as to its origin. faa officials at bishop (airport) stated that the thunderstorms had interruptedpower at the facility sometime after 10 pm thursday. an emergency generatorrestored most functions, but the north-south runway lights remained inoperableand so that runway was closed for the remainder of the night. the airportsraw\\bulk radar system had ceased functioning at 11 pm as scheduled. the airportlog showed no light aircraft or helicopter int he area of the sighting near thetime given. likewise, neither the genesse county sheriff department nor the airnational guard had aircraft in the vicinity that night. as conveyed to the msptrooper, the consumers power employees were unaware of the events at hand. theutility pole generator was dysfunctional when they arrived, and so theirattention was entirely centered on assessing and repairing the damage. withlittle question, a power surge caused by lightning earlier in the evening hadcaused the problem. the day and evening of thursday, july 21 was, weatherwise,atrocious throughout michigan. several lines of thunderstorms crossed the lowerpeninsula, some with hail and damaging winds, and numerous communities werewithout electricity for many hours. so, while inconclusive, it is certainlynoteworthy that the ______ and ________ observed the craft within an hour of theremaining cloud covers retreat to the east. the national weather serviceoffice in flint indicated that at 1 am, the citys skies continued overcast at7000 ft., though by 2 am scattered clouds only remained. moreover, the arrivalof repairmen within minutes of the sighting, coupled with the observation thatthe craft extinguished its headlamps and moved away within a second or so of thepole being struck, may not be coincidental. allowing for some variances intheir accounts, there is no reason to suspect the witnesses report as given. in terms of the descriptive drawings, that of ___ is probably the least accuratein that she wears prescriptive lenses for astigmatism but did not have them onat the time. further, ____ deferred in large part to the sketches of the twochildren, stating that she had concentrated on the bright metallic belt aroundthe vehicle together with the prongs underneath and so had noticed little inthe way of light configurations or shape of the craft. the boy and girl,drawing separately from memory the next day, depicted the object in remarkablysimilar fashion. it might be postulated that the bar of red light shown in_____ sketch was in actuality the metallic band seen by _____, with the glow ofred from a row of lights above giving misimpression that the metallic band wasalso lighted. in summary, this appears to be a credible ce-1. perhaps thegreater learning experience was gained by the vehicles occupants in respect tothe interruption and restoration of electrical power. a summary statement is also included, written by dan wright, concerning thestate troopers report which wont be included here, however most informationfrom within the report is already included in the above
