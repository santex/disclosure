After stopping and getting out of the vehicle they both took turns viewing the disc-shaped object which had lights on it and did not appear to be moving. After a short time of viewing the UFO left the area at an extremely high rate of speed (unlike anything man-made). In just a few moments the reason for the departure of the UFO was very evident - fighter jets had been deployed and came streaking across the sky, but they were \"too late\" to intercept. My brother still has clear recolection of this sighting and I do not think that he has previously reported it. Edward servied honorably in Navy Intelligence and I respect his story. David E.
