I had a panoramic view of the sky in front of me. There were no tall buildings and not much urban sprawl. While driving, all of a sudden straight ahead and above me in the distance, I saw a green, glowing dot in the sky, about at a 60 degree vertical angle from my eye level. The glowing neon green ball seemed to appear out of no where and falling straight downwards from the sky for about a quarter of a of second. After this brief falling motion, in mid-air, it completely stopped on the dime for about a milisecond, and then accelerated horizontally outwards at a 90 angle, faster than it had been falling downwards, so fast that it seemed to disappear. At the beginning I thought it could have been an ice cluster from a flying airplane, but when it stopped in midair and changed direction, I then knew that it was not this. I was speechless when I witnessed this, shocked, and then excited after."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12092008-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.546165,+-77.430568(14324)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14324) map </A>","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Richmond","There were no other sightings in Richmond on or around December 15th 2004"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14324.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14324.html"]}
