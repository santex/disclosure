{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn October 6th in Centennial, CO at about 3:00pm I was sitting in my car facing west at the school bus stop where my grandson would be dropped off to be driven back to our house. Before the bus arrived, I was looking through the front windshield and suddenly noticed an odd V-shaped object moving slowly across the sky going North. There was no sound, and the V shape was moving in the direction of the open end on its side like this < not in the pointed direction as one might imagine. This seemed to be metallic looking and possibly glinting in the afternoon sunlight, although the ���glint��� changed position to different locations along the 2 lines forming the <. No windows and no apparent lights from the craft. After about a minute, I was still watching when it instantly disappeared and could not be seen again. I could not relocate the object in view even after intense scrutiny of the area in front of the path of motion. It just seemed to disappear into thin air. So the two strangest aspects of this were the object moving in the open V direction, and the fact that it disappeared instantly from view after a full minute of observation. I���ve seen many aircraft in my lifetime, but never anything like this, because it just seemed to come into view suddenly and then disappear suddenly without a trace."],"Date Submitted":"10/07/2009 02:59 UTC","Log Number":"US-10072009-0008","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-104.871553","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Centennial","There were no other sightings in Centennial on or around October 6th 2009"],"City":"Centennial","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/06/2009 03:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Summary":"< Shaped - metallic looking traveling in the direction of the open < shape.","Case Number":"19848","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.583595,+-104.871553(19848)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19848) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19848.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19848.html"],"Latitude":"39.583595"}
