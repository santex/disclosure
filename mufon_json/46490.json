They were pointing up at the sky, and when I looked up at the sky I noticed 4 circular objects beaming orange lights off of them. I immediately thought they were UFOs because of the manner in which they hovered over us. They were close enough to appear large to us, but I really couldn't tell you just how big. I'd say they appeared the width of a mini-van. As they hovered away, they got smaller until they disappeared. Another one then showed up and disappeared. Just then, 3 more showed up in the sky, making them 8 total. They were all coming from and going towards the same direction. The last three that showed up in the sky formed a triangle, to only then disappear before our eyes. We were all very nervous about this encounter as it was something we could not explain."],"Latitude":"42.254448","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/30/2013 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-71.82473","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Worcester","There were no other sightings in Worcester on or around March 30th 2013"],"Case Number":"46490","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Massachusetts","Date Submitted":"03/30/2013 02:45 UTC"}
