( i cant take the lies anymore) before i start i want to say something to you first . you dont want to see a space craft !. it's just not worth the many lonely nights of siliently weeping and wondering to myself because the goverment wont confirm what i know to be true . it was back in 2001 mid summer 10:35pm . i was outside in my back yard. having a cigerette . the night sky was very beautiful and cloudless. a huge white oval bright shaped flying object, soundless with large lights surounding it's middle that did not blink or pulsate came into view from behind my neighbours maple tree (i should mention my house is bordering a large park with a school ) i also want to mention the differant colours red, blue, green and yellow (i think the colours are important for us understanding how this object flys) anyways .....it wafted very slowly and very level across to the middle of the field i was dumbfounded ! i concidered hopping the fence to run closer and stand underneath it but for reasons i still cant get a grip on i remained stationary (and calm). it took about 5 minutes to reach the middle of the field then just like someone hitting a light switch .it just just vanished i thought to myself this secret military craft is awesome .. while i was searching the skys for it .....it freaking reappeared ! (i'am crying again) over my neighbours house and continued to slowly move again in a northly direction (i estimate it flew to the soccer, baseball fields that are about 3-4 minute walk from me and then shot and i mean shot because it took off like a bullet to a spot in the sky that it is our true north . ......i lost sight of it within i mean under 1.5 seconds . i returned into the house in a state of disbelief and went upstairs and just stared out the window to where it shot off to and began thinking who do i call (police , airport, military, my local goverment representitive ?????).......i want to know what you would do ......but anyways heres what i did .....because i'am just a mere mortal man i forced myself to believe it was just some army \\ airforce navy boy getting into trouble by taking out the latest invention out for a tour .so i cowarded into nonaction anyways 20 minutes later while i'am still staring out the window .......the military jets could be heard doing flyovers (twice or two planes) then the helicopters flew by.....it took me over 2 years to mention it publicaly and this is my first and only time to report this online.....ladies and gentlemen this thing was in my estimation 200-300 feet wide by 100-125 feet in hieght and i dont believe any military craft like this is possible by even the best tech we have availabe here on earth ...i have now studied the history of ufo via my computer andi'am left weeping and wondering if this is god ?............one more thing it flew only 100 feet above the ground and at it's furthest point to me was only 150 feet away (identifiable) i did not see a strange light in the sky ......ps if the goverment did finaly announce the existance of such things i can honestly say my emotional state would greatly improve . please feel free to show my story to your goverment .....thank you and please have a happy new year........ps 2 nights ago i got incontact with stanton friedman .and i'am taking his advice ... so be prepared for a ufo story comming soon out of thornhill ont (on the border with toronto canada) because it was to huge for me to be the only witness and now the us goverments denial was the straw that broke the camels back for me it's now time to talk out loud !"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.661436,+-79.379184(9257)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9257) map </A>","City":"Toronto","Longitude":"-79.379184","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around August 19th 2001"],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:12:01","Summary":"ovid","Region":"Ontario"}
