At first we just thought it was falling or shooting star but it had no tail. It seemed to fall straight for a few seconds but the almost started spinning in the sky. It moved left and then right but continued in a downward pattern. The whole event took 3 or 4 minutes and we both kept our eyes on it as it got more and more distant. It may have burnt out or just took off into the distance. We couldn't be sure. Both of us kept saying to each other, \"Oh my god, what is this?\" We laughed saying, \"Is this a UFO?\" Then we got quiet as this went on for too long to not be something REAL! We have looked all over the internet to find if anyone else has reported this and found this site to make our own report."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.06835","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23075.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23075.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Melbourne Beach","There were no other sightings in Melbourne Beach on or around May 1st 2010"],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
