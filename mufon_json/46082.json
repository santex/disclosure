I thought it was a helicopter but no flashing lights and no sound. I kept walking and maybe 20 seconds later another red-orange circle appeared, then another one and another one. Im not sure if there were 5 or 6 because I was fumbling with my phone calling people to tell them to go out and look and then I tried to get some pictures. The lights all started in the same spot, were moving at a rather slow speed, equidistant and in a slightly curved line. My husband said the last one stopped and hovered for a while. I started thinking thats really weird, it didnt look like the usual stuff you see in the night sky. I watched as the lights followed each other and then they were gone."],"Log Number":"US-03082013-0004","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46082.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46082.html"],"Case Number":"46082","Date of the Event":"03/07/2013 08:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Citrus Heights","There was one other sighting in Citrus Heights on or around March 7th 2013"],"Country":"United States"}
