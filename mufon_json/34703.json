As we drove we spotted unusual lights along the foot hills and talked together about what we were witnessing. I took out my cell phone with the video camera and got lucky a got a few in the video... I have that video... In that video you hear our conversation and you can hear and see what we saw. The UFO'S are seen at aprox 1min into the video, I left the 3min version intact to show in context what we seen as these strange lights went out of sight... The lights seemed to follow along close to the ground (guessing a few hundred feet) and turn left over the top of the foot hills. The light were pulsing a red color light on and off. There were many over 50 I would guess. All the UFO'S sighted were not videoed... Strange stuff happens Thanks Dan"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","City":"Lake Havasu City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34703.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34703.html"]}
