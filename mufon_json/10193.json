It was brighter than any star and it appeared before any other stars were visible. It lasted for around 5 seconds and dimmed out. It did not move. We were sitting on the porch swing. My father and I noticed it at the exact same time and both remarked \"Look at that star!\". I have never seen anything like that. I believe it may have been an exploding star. When night fell no stars were visible in the same area as where this star had appeared."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-04072008-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.849522,+-102.364023(10193)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10193) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Bright star appearance after sunset","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Odessa","There were no other sightings in Odessa on or around April 6th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"31.849522","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Odessa","Date of the Event":"04/06/2008 08:40 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10193.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10193.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10193.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"10193"}
