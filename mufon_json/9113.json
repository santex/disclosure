My mother was inside and I called to her several times to come look. Finally I said \"Mommy, come look at this funny looking moon\". It seemed to have been hovering while I was alone but when she came out it started to move, slowly to the northest. We walked around the corner of the house to find that our elderly neighbors were also watching it from across the road. It moved directly over our house from southeast to northwest. There were no memorable flashing lights but a disk or \"saucer\" like object that seemed to be sitting still then moved away with deliberation. We watched until it was out of our sight. It was smaller than a full moon but still perfectly round, so it must have been fairly close to the ground, perhpas five to ten thousand feet. There was no sound. Mother and I discussed this many times over the years but I still have a vivid memory of the event."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.965108,+-95.260704(9113)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9113) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Jacksonville","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville on or around November 30th 1946"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
