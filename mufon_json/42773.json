It glowed bright yellow for several seconds and slowly faded. I could not determine the size, but it was large. This was not a flare or meteor, it had a definite outline. The object was about 280��� relative to my location and 30��� above the horizon, above the hills (or farther) that are 5 miles to the west. I did not see any movement, only the shape of the object. To give an idea of the shape, think of a B-2 \"Stealth Bomber\", at a 90��� bank, cockpit to the right. The difference is that the rear portion was a crescent instead of the faceted trailing edge of the B-2, and had a dark spot in the center. We are nowhere near an AFB or any AF practice area! My husband is a Multi-engine Pilot, (for almost 40 years) and I know what is, and is not an aircraft. I am reporting this in case others saw this and needed someone else to attest a sighting... Thank you..."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.354279,+-85.744318(42773)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42773) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Indiana","Log Number":"US-09232012-0023"}
