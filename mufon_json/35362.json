{"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"01/30/2012 08:35 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"35362","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was working in the back yard installing wall motions lights at my residence shortly after dusk. As I glanced up to the sky, I had noticed a square box as large as a SUV.On each corner it had a bright light shinning straight down and a red light in the center was flashing.It was moving in a straight line.It was moving too fast to be a blimp and too slow to be an airplane. I heard no noise coming from it. I ran across my backyard keeping my eye focused on it as it continued to move EAST until I lost sight of it. After it was out from my sight, I tried to reason as to what it was that I had just seen, but logically I could not decipher what it could have been. But I am certain I know what it was not.Even though I believe of the possiblity of UFO's I was too embaraced to share my experience with co-workers."],"Date of the Event":"01/22/2012 07:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35362.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35362.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.896525,+-96.700924(35362)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35362) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Dallas","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01302012-0019","Summary":"square craft lights on each corner red light in center","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around January 22nd 2012"],"Longitude":"-96.700924","Latitude":"32.896525"}
