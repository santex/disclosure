I was on my trampoline outside with my sister. 2. We were jumping around and I looked up and saw it at an 80 degree angle in the sky (with 90 degrees being straight up, perpendicular to the ground). 3. I was unsure, but it didn't look like anything I've ever seen before. I knew it was a UFO. 4. The UFO was a black disc with a single, red, blinking light on one edge. The object flipped very slowly, around one rotation every five seconds. It did not spin around an axis from top-to-bottom, but instead on an axis from side-to-side, through the edge, so that it flipped front over back. When it you watched it, it was flipping in the direction it was moving. It moved very slowly as well, and it took around three minutes to become a tiny speck on the horizon. 5. I felt amazed and curious. I didn't really know what to think. 6. The object eventually got too far away to see clearly, until it was not visible at all."],"Longitude":"-74.400591","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"04/19/2013 04:32 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:10","Date of the Event":"07/15/2009 04:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.064514,+-74.400591(46855)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46855) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Black disc with single blinking red dot.
