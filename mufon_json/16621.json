Three lights in a fixed triangle shape was directly over head!!! The lights were huge, much larger than an airplane and they were not blinking. There was a strange wavey kind of haze under the hole triangle...like heat rising from the pavement. It was moving north and faster than any plane I've ever seen...it was not a plane!!!!! Planes are not this large, this fast, and silent.or cover that much distance in such a short time. WOW was my reaction as my mouth droped open...this really is real... It flew out of sight heading north. As I finished my smoke wondering if I should share my sighting.... I was overcome with a feeling of calm...I saw what saw and will no longer wonder \"if\". Only wish I had caught it on tape."],"trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around April 22nd 2009"],"City":"Sacramento","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California"}
