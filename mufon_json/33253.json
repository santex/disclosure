We just turned from tudor onto boniface rd. Coming down the hill on boniface on object appeared from the west about a quater mile in front of us about 50feet above the trees. As it was traveling forward it descended to just above the trees and turned sharply to its left (north). Now it was traveling the same direction as us along the boniface road and its started to ascend to couple thousand feet. The object flew right past the airforce base and just kept traveling north. This was not military to my belief. It was large, teardrop shaped, dark steel in color, and the surface appeared to be reflective, extremely fast, and silent. We witnessed this object for only about 15 seconds. It was very very fast. There were other cors on the road i'm sure other people seen it. About 2 minutes after I witnessed it lots of military aircraft started flying around looking for it."],"City":"Anchorage","Region":"Alaska","Longitude":"-149.895798","Country":"United States"}
