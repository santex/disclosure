My family was watching tv, and happened to see it from our living room window. They only saw it for a minute or so, until it disappeared out of view, behind a neighbor's house. It was oval-shaped, with a greenish glow. It kept a steady speed, and did not fluctuate in size. Also, it did not give off a tail or like meteorite would. There were no blinking lights. It's path was north to south. This was not a helicopter or a plane, but it could have been a meteorite, even though it did not have the normal signs of one."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-95.992218","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28736.html"],"Log Number":"US-04202011-0018","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.256503,+-95.992218(28736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28736) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Nebraska","City":"Omaha","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
