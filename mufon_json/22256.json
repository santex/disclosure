It all made sense at the time ,i thought as a 6 year old \"oh teah just like on the bugs bunny cartoon when the spaceship had lights around it saying \"eat at Joes\". It was the happened to be in the same direction of the ocean as when I saw something large and metallic the year before 2008 that looked just like the craft I saw as a child, also sometime in June, it plunged in the ocean and never came out I was watching the sunset from my living room window. The incident last summer I awoke at 3:30 in the morning and out my window where the ocean is at least a half a mile down I have abroad view of it due to living on a hill,when i awoke the was the brightest light coming from it seems like the edge of the earth where it curves though I do not know how far my visibility is.This light was so bright the were huge shadows of me on my walls and as bright and far away the source was coming from there was no way it was from a boat or any kind of earthly vessel,it stayed lit for about 20 minutes,although it was early I tried to call my neighbor to verify what I was seeing and the phones were oddly busy,you know that fast busy sound,not a normal one."],"Date of the Event":"07/20/2009 03:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City"}
