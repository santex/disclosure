(we also noticed these same type of objects during june of last year 2009 looking directly south\\southwestard that moved slowly from right to left over the treeeline)"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25183.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25183.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date Submitted":"08/26/2010 12:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Diamond, Other"}
