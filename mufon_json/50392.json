On at least two different occasions, maybe 20-30 minutes apart, I saw a moving beam of green light in the distance toward the hills off to my left. It was coming from the ground and traversing the sky. I thought it might have been an artificial device to help aircraft see at night. I just wonder what it was. (Years later I learned there were notable UFO sightings in Montana in mid and late 1975, which added to my curiosity.)"],"Region":"Montana","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09032013-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50392.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50392.html"],"Latitude":"46.889352","Date Submitted":"09/03/2013 03:38 UTC","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
