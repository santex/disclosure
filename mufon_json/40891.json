The area was crowded with people. I had my camera with me to take pictures of the beach,my wife,ocean and different happenings on the beach. One of the pictures was of two umbrellas near the water the umbrellas with the ocean behind them made an interesting shot. I did not see anything in the sky other than lots of cloud formations. When I reviewed the pictures on my computer the the next day I noticed a dark object over the right umbrella over the water please see picture enclosed. I zoomed in on the object and saw a round object with maybe four antennas. As I further looked at the picture there was another object below the larger object. I thought about your organization and decided to send you the picture, maybe you can identify it. There has been a lot of news about Drones in the US, maybe thats what is in the picture."],"Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"noticed object in picture taken","Tags":"City","City":"Rehobeth Beach"}
