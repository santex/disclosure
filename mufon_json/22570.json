CAUGHT 3 SILVER SHINY DISC SHAPE OBJECTS IN FORMATION OVERHEAD GOING DUE NORTH, FAST. COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE SILVER IN COLOR REFLECTING ON THE LEFT SIDE, THEY TRAVELED 30 DEGREES FROM THE HORIZON CHANGED FORMATION,BUT CONTINUED TOGETHER; THAT'S WHEN THE REFLECTION FROM THE SUN WAS MORE APPARENT. A SECOND OR TWO AFTER THEY CHANGED FORMATION, THEY HEADED DUE WEST TOWARD THE GULF, AFTER WHICH MY VIEW WAS OBSTRUCTED DUE TO TREES, ETC. CAME IN THRU THE HOUSE OUT THE GARAGE TO SEE MORE OF THEM BUT THEY WERE GONE. I AM 48 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT -- AND I DON'T DO DRUGS! THERE WAS ALSO NO COM TRAIL, NO SOUND, BUT THEY WERE HIGH. DID NOT HAVE ANY OTHER OBJECT TO COMPARE TO FOR SCALE -- HARD TO JUDGE HOW BIG THE OBJECTS WERE OR AT WHAT ALTTITUDE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN AT."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.673697,+-81.509194(22570)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22570) map </A>","Tags":"City"}
