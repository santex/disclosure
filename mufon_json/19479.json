{"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"09/20/2009 06:40 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"New Mexico","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went out to get the morning paper about 0630. The sun was still behind the mountain and I could see another star in the east. Looking to the north was a very bright \"star\". This is the first time i've seen this prior to today. I went into the house to get my binocs. and when viewed, the object looked balloon shaped. It did not appear to be moving. After about five minutes two smaller lights desended from the \"star\" and created a vertical line of now three equal size lights. As the sun continued to rise the daylight washed out the object. I took a pic with my camera when first seen, but have no reference point. Just a bright dot in the sky. The sky was cloudless and clear. I have never seen a ufo, and living in Albuquerque could tell this was not a hot air balloon."],"Case Number":"19479","Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 10:48 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.090961,+-106.647597(19479)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19479) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19479.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19479.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Albuquerque","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were 3 other sightings in Albuquerque on or around September 20th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.090961","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-09202009-0019","Summary":"Bright light in morning sky turning into three smaller lights.","Longitude":"-106.647597"}
