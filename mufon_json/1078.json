It moved towards me and was movingslow over some trees, I looked up at it only for a second and continued on. When I got a mile or so down the road it didnt seem right, so I turned aroundagain and continued home. About a half mile down the road I saw it above afield moving slowly. I lost sight of it behind some barns but when it passed Istopped my car and looked up, it was 30 ft. up and 30 ft. off the road and ithad three glowing globes in an triangle about three feet apart with a dimflashing light in the center. I rolled my window down to get a better look atit, it made no noise. When I couldnt make out what it was I got the hell outof there. When I got home I called the state police and reported it.
