I noticed a bright light appear that was football shaped and was in a straight line parallel with the ground..... I had time to say \"look at that\" .... Which my coworker did and we observed it for 2 seconds before it just vanished. No light trail, no red lights... Just like it turned its lights out.... But it wasn't dark yet and it was like it cloaked itself or something.... Really strange... We were both freaking out."]}
