before you blow me off, i just want to say, nuforc, will regret not taking me serious, please don't make the same mistake. there is great video, and the whole story is legit!!!! if i can get a pro out here with a nice camera its all over!! i just need a creditable witness, cuz no one's believing me!! so here���s my story..... the climax of my first night, and all my other sightings, was when i was watching six of them and they all moved up at the same time in a very unique way! i���ve seen these ufo���s 5 different nights now. i���ve got four other witness���s , and as of now i���ve got about 1-2 hour���s of good video tape all together . on nov,22,2009 i was getting in bed . after i laid down i looked out my bedroom window and was gazing at the eastern night sky. it was around midnight and the sky was clear of clouds. i happened to notice a star flickering and calmly thought to myself, satellite? yeah most likely, but then i remembered a show i watched about quasar���s. which i believe are black holes that emit a flashing light from its center. but i was not alarmed or even startled. i was wondering if i was really looking at a quasar, or was it simply just a satellite?? well, that���s when it started moving and my jaw dropped and my heart started to race. i was so excited , i wanted to tell the world or start video taping , but all i could do was lay in bed with my head propped on my hand , for i feared i would never ever see anything like this again. which i was dead wrong about! but i didn���t want to stop watching , plus i just finished moving so i had no clue where my video camera was, and all i could think of was using my cell phone, but i knew it wouldn���t get anything worth while. so i laid and watched. usually when i see them its between 10:30 p.m and 1:00 am eastern time. they usually appear in threes, and only on the very first night was there ever more than three confirmed moving in the sky in one night. these ufo���s seem to have intelligent operator���s. i say this because i���ve went out side twice to try to see them better on the first couple nights but when i went out they became very still, and continued to remain still for 10 mins or so after i went inside my house. to be honest and upfront, they look and in a sense act like star���s. that���s the main reason why i said they had intelligent operators! in due time these ufo���s ���glide ���as i call it across the night sky. but they don���t only glide! they make short, very very fast jerky movements at times. i���ve seen them do u turns, complete vertical loops and double loops, and single and double horizontal loops! they do pointless maneuvers like, right-----> left , right--------->left, right------> and i���ve seen them do 45 degree turns one right after another, they flicker but usually are the same basic colors of the stars, but the same three seem to keep appearing and one of the three is always a amberish color. but they have a flicker effect to them that always catches my eye. i spotted the very first one only because it was flickering. they make, what look like very short, fast, and erratic movements, but if your not watching that one target you would never see it moving, but on the other hand, if your only watching the one so called star no human alive would doubt me when it moves !!! i���ve seen them slowly dim out, i���ve seen them flicker what seemed to be, at one another , and then start to flicker in sync. when they flickered at each other and in sync the did it very brightly, and instead of a flicker, they kind of flashed. but the night they flashed and flickered at one another and in sync was my first night. that night i spotted one, then i identified three, then out of nowhere three more showed up, and than i was watching multiple targets move at once, since at that time they all moved rather close to each other and grouped up, allowing me to see more than one move at once. that���s around the time they all moved up in a weird fashion ���which can be described if asked��� the only time i could really count them was when they all moved weirdly up together. they would dim down and disappear and reappear out of nowhere. but when they moved up together , they all stayed lit up, allowing me to count quickly. but the most craziest part is when a bright one, ���some are brighter than others��� shot out three more of these ufo���s . one came out straight down. then the other two shot out at a downward 45 degree angle , one on each side. the climax lasted maybe, 4-8 mins then if they didn���t dim down and disappear, they moved slowly out of the south east sky, and continued moving to and threw the south southeast sky, until i could not see them no more threw my window. but , the way they move makes no sense, and the way they accelerate is unbelivablely fast!! they seem to be able to stop just as fast as well! i have a lot more to say but don���t want to ramble on. there is so much to gain from what i���m seeing. i can only hope you take me serious. i would gladly upload the video i���ve got but my camcorder use���s 8mm tapes, but i���ve burned it to a dvd+r disc, but i cant get my computer to read it!!!! i could mail a copy????? when i video taped i opened my window ���even though it was freezing��� and removed my screen and video taped while my camera sat completely still on my window sill. i also have footage that was shot threw a normal window screen. the video is really convincing!!! now, i love outer space and stargazing! i just turned 29 this year , so for about 15 years now i���ve avidly looked at the sky. and i wouldn���t be writing this, nore would i have lost any sleep the first night, if i had stopped watching what i thought might have been a quasar, ��� which didn���t alarm me until it moved!��� just one second before it started moving. but when that star\\quasar started moving, well���. lets just say that���s 3 seconds of movement i���ll never forget! i need more and better cameras, i need professionals to see this!!!!!! please contact me!!!!!!!"],"Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","Summary":"They flicker and sit in the sky like a star.
