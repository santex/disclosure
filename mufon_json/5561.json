It was dark due to the lack of street lights in the rural area in which we reside. My friend suddenly asked if we had just seen that. We hadn't the slightest clue what she was talking about, so we asked if she could please elaborate on 'that'. She said that as we walked past my other neighbors house, she noticed a bright light that appeared to be a star descending slowly from the sky. She described it as star like with a slighly bluish tint, and told us that it appeared to be right behind the trees behind my neighbors house and had slowly descended until it disappeared. I had made sure to ask how it had disappeared, and she said that she had thought that it had slowly dimmed until it was no longer visable. I had also made sure to inquire whether or not she had been simply seeing things. She said she had looked away and blinked a few times before looking back. We had immediately walked behind my friend's house with a mini-maglite (which I had just happened to have been carrying at the time) and examined the area around the trees. My original theory was that a piece of aluminum foil, carried into the trees by the previous days wind, had finally been loosed and reflected moonlight as it fell (the moon was full that night,I believe). Finding nothing we returned to my neighbors house and discussed possible explainations. This account is taken from my memory of her desciption from the date of the sighting, so it may have slight deviations from her exact testimony. After we had all headed home, approximately 10 pm, I researched other cases describing a bright light that appeared to be descending from the sky on NUFORC.com and have formed a more plausible theory that my friend had actually seen the light of a celestial body reflected off of a passing sattelite. I have a limited knowledge of sattelites, but using this knowledge, I have formed this hypothesis. A sattelite had angled itself such that the light hitting it had been reflect to our position on Earth. The sattelite continued to angle itself towards what would be the ground to earthly veiwers. The light appeared to be descending and as the sattelite continued to angle, less light was hitting it directly and was being reflected towards us until no light was being reflected at all. If this theory were correct and my assumptions are unflawed, I believe this would account for the apparent dimming of the light."]}
