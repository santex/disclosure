I had just finished speaking at a Phoenix MUFON meeting and my wife and I where driving to a skywatch with the Arizona MUFON State Director Jim Mann. Traveling East on US60. Just before the Gilbert Road exit I noticed something in the sky to the south of us, or off to the right of the car. It was about 90 degrees above the horizon. Looking closer I realized it was huge cylinder-shaped ufo. I watched it for about 30 seconds to make sure I was indeed seeing a ufo before I alerted Jim Mann. The 3 of us watched the object for about another 30 to 45 seconds when it suddenly shrank in size and turn into a small, rapidly blinking light and then it dissapeared. The sky was clear and free of any clouds."]}
