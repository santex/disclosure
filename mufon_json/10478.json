LOOKING INTO SOUTHERN SKY I SPOTED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT, BRIGHTER AND BIGGER THAN A STAR. THE OJECT WAS NOT MOVING. I SAW A FLASHING STROBE LIKE LIGHT IN THE UPPER RIGHT, THE LIGHT WAS GREEN IN COLOR. A FLASHING RED LIGHT FROM THE BOTTOM CENTER OF THE OBJECT WAS SMALLER THAN THE GREEN. NO SOUND WAS HEARD. I WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE AFTER 25 MIN. THE OBJECT WAS STILL IN SKY AND NOT MOVING. THE SKY WAS CLEAR FOR THE MOST PART WIND WAS LITTLE OR NONE. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK AT FIRST UNTILL I SAW THE GREEN AND RED LIGHTS. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE WHITE LIGHT AND THE FLASHING OR STROBING OF THE GREEN AND RED I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A VERY BRIGHT STAR.
