Waterbury, CT. We were in the upstairs of our house when we saw a red-orange fireball through the window moving slowly across the sky. We went outside to observe. It hovered for about 30 seconds, then continued, traveling southeast. It appeared to turn. It returned about 4 or 5 minutes later, traveling back over our street, then turning to disappear over the tree line as before. It was silent. We thought perhaps it was space junk burning up as it entered the atmosphere, but when it came back, we realized that it could not have been that. It was mesmerizing because it was so unusual. We called the police, they came and took the report, but were obviously unable follow up in any way."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
