I noticed a slow moving, light orange light moving across the NW part of the sky. I knew it wasn't a satellite because it was light orange, and wasn't the right shape. I went inside and grabbed binoculars. It was still there when I came back out. I could clearly see the outline of the classic disc shape with the light orange lights the were glowing softly, and appeared to be from the top to the bottom of the ship. I watched it travel eastward. At one point, it \"jumped\", but otherwise, it did not blink or move sporadically. It just moved slowly across the sky. I watched for about 15 minutes until I lost it behind trees in the NE. At that time I drew a sketch of it. I was really excited because I was sure I was seeing something strange."],"Log Number":"US-07312010-0010","Region":"Nevada","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/10/2010 03:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.539483,+-119.812173(24862)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24862) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24862","Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/31/2010 02:32 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc"}
