When I reveiwed video I noticed this light appear forming into golden orb as its rising, dropping then disappearing in the lower left corner, reappearing again on left side and I also notice what seems to be 1 on left side of street light. I thought it was reflextion but noticed at one point it moves away from light a short distance. There seems to be alot of activity during cloudy and stormy days in this area so I have a few other pictures."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.874711,+-87.833873(31133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31133) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.874711","Region":"Illinois","Summary":"Taking video of strange cloud over river during storm","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Maywood","Tags":"City","Case Number":"31133","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
