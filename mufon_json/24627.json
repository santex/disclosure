{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile I was watching TV I was occasionally looking out my living room window. One time when I got out of my chair looking outside I saw a brief image of a purple plane without any back wings. It promptly went behind a tree on my front lawn. It was only about 55 high. Then minutes later I saw in the south a tiny dot of white light traveling eastward. It would get big and bright then dim then tiny again...I just stopped watching it, because it greatly resembled the lights I filmed between 2003 to 2005."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.838513,+-117.904654(24627)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24627) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/25/2009 06:18 UTC","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Log Number":"US-07182010-0019","Longitude":"-117.904654","Latitude":"33.838513","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/18/2010 04:40 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24627.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24627.html"],"Summary":"Why all the UFOs?","Case Number":"24627","City":"Anaheim","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There were no other sightings in Anaheim on or around November 25th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
