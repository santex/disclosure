It fell a very long time, with a very bright long trail behind it. It was falling stright down. Then, it suddenly stopped, and started shinning bright like a star. After about 10 seconds, it started zig-zagging down towards the ground with trails, until it disappeared behind some trees. It was definitely not a falling star. We don't know what it was though."],"trends":[],"Case Number":"13260","Date of the Event":"10/25/2008 07:10 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed"}
