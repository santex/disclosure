It transforms out of an energy shell when not in direct light.","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis wasn���t the first sighting of a UFO, in 1964 a friend and I watched many strange light traverse the heavens and with assurance we could say they were not satellites. Satellites cannot perform maneuvers of a triangle from horizon to horizon in less than 10 seconds. Part of this is important to the latter part of this saga because it is of a bizarre parallel event. My friend joined the Navy but while he was gone there were more UFO sightings near and around Bartlesville. I had seen many lights in the far distant stop in flight and descend where there had been reports made by other people. But on one particular afternoon I happened to look to the N.E. and see a Saturn type of UFO. It was a mirror like sphere with a disconnected ring about the middle. This I thought could only be an hallucination as there was as there was a helical cork screw of fire coming from the bottom that was distended from the sphere and rotating in a clockwise manor. The only thought I can recall of this is that all of this goes against the laws of physics. This encounter I remember happened sometime before I was married in 1966 and that was in May, I remember that it was warm and the grass was just turning green. That was an important factor as when I first saw this object I thought it might be a crop dusting craft. Well actually the first thought was that it was one of those aluminum sided trucks in the distance as the reflection from the metal from time to time was blinding me as I drove down highway 75 from Bartlesville to Tulsa to see my future wife. My background to this sighting is that at this time I was a confused 18-year-old teenager with anger management problems that had tossed a job as a photojournalist out the window because of psychological reasons. The total length of this event may have been as long as 20 minutes. It all began as a trip to see my girlfriend which was a 30 or so minute drive along highway 75. At first there was this annoying flash of bright sunlight in the distance on the road in front of me. It was much like the reflection of sunlight from the rear of a polished metal van and it was becoming irritating that truckers had vans like this just because they looked cool when parked. After about 5 min of this irritation this turned to the E. on what I thought to be a road in the far distance. But to my amazement this luminous object did a rapid turnaround and was traveling W. I thought this to be very curious because a big rig doesn���t have the capabilities to rapidly change directions; then again it changed directions so I thought maybe this was an aerial crop duster. I was thinking that it must be a Bell helicopter with the sun reflecting off the bubble canopy they have. Also at that time it was a widely used helicopter for crop dusting. In high school I was in the civil air patrol and became very good at identifying aircraft. An older friend of the family was a crop duster in Arizona so I thought I might stop a while and watch him work as it appeared that it was working his was toward me. The craft made two or three East to West and West to East passes then began a low lever flight Northward about 200 meters parallel to the highway much like a crop duster would do. The distance was still over a half mile away but I could tell that it was something hovering over the ground at about 10 meters or less. As it traveled toward me the first thing I noticed was the silence of this craft, it was still about a half mile away but there was no sound and that was a very curious thing to me, conventional aircraft make noise at miles away. I think one of my early impressions was that if this is a helicopter traveling that close to the ground why wasn���t there any noise or dust being thrown up by the downdraft? This object kept traveling Northward in my direction until I recognized that it was nothing like anything of this world. It was a perfect sphere like that of a mirror, reflecting all that is around it. On it���s surface I could see the ground the sky and the sun beaming back at me. The sun was low on the horizon just minutes before dusk now and the orange orb reflecting from this orb was tolerable enough to be mesmerized by the beauty of a 20 meter mirror sphere with all the world reflecting from it. It was like the sphere in 1984 movie the Starman. When I stopped my vehicle I did stop in the shadow of a surrounding hill and by chance gave me an opportunity to witness something I haven���t heard of anyone else mention in all these years of reading UFO reports. There could be I just haven���t read about it yet. The oddity was that when this spherical object crossed the line of sunlight into the shadow it was like dissolving of the sphere and out came the flying disk. At this point the hair on the back of my neck must have been standing straight out because the hair on my head was beginning to tingle. In fact my whole body was beginning to vibrate almost out of control. The object had changed course and was coming straight at me. The adrenalin was pumping so hard my heart went past my throat and felt like it was pounding somewhere in my brain. As it approached a red portal appeared and rotated to my direction, within that portal I saw a being shadowed with barely enough frontal light to distinguish that it was a humanoid face and it was looking directly at me. I have never been that terrified in my life because as it approached it had to rise in the air to clear the power lines to fly directly overhead. I don���t remember exactly what I thought at that moment but as that moment went I remember looking for my camera and thinking about temporal distortions. I sat there looking out all windows of my vehicle waiting to see where it was going but it never passed overhead. It was like that scene where the girl has to open the door even though she knows there is a boogieman out there. So I���m setting there wondering where this craft is and I know it is straight overhead. Finally I get the courage to open the car door and look up. The sky was clear and the sun had gone passed the horizon and it was one of those picture perfect spring afternoons. There is nothing that could have prepared me for this experience. It truly changes all religious views and your prospective on government information. Later in years I reunited with my high school chum and on comparing life notes it seems that he too had a UFO experience while on board of a frigate escort ship. From his recounting of his tale it would seem that we had our experiences around the same period except that he exclaimed that his UFO was much larger and followed the USS Joulet for a number of days. He was a fire control technician and said that it never showed up on his radar and for something that was about half the size of a frigate destroyer is an accomplishment. Said he had pictures but when they came back they were in quarantine and locked down. Also told that things would happen to them if they ever told anyone about this encounter. I have no idea if his encounter was real or not but then how would anyone ever know if mine was real."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","trends":["There have been 59 other sightings in Tulsa","There were no other sightings in Tulsa on or around April 25th 1966","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"04/25/1966 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"36.162292","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","City":"Tulsa","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.162292,+-95.984235(11898)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11898) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08032008-0010","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"Window(s), Other","Date of the Event":"04/25/1966 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-95.984235","Case Number":"11898"}
