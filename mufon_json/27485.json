The night was overcast and particularly to the west. They were flying SW and then turned west away from Sarasota (my residence) and flew into a bank of clouds. They were about three to four miles away and past the barrier island off the coast (my guess) and initially were under the cloud cover and easily visible. They were distinct and bright, brighter than any star. They appeared to be separate and only connected through proximity. I saw no other lights associated with them. If they were planes, they were perhaps standing on their afterburners. My question is, are afterburners orange? I always thought they were bluish I am very familiar with airplanes and I have never seen this color associated with aircraft."],"City":"Sarasota","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/22/2011 11:39 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.337755,+-82.525583(27485)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27485) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/15/2011 10:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01222011-0010","Summary":"Three apparently separate orange lights with no blinking.","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"27485"}
