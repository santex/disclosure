The man in the photo is my friend Tony and his horse. He does not remember who took the picture. He does recall seeing a flash of light at the moment the photo was taken. He loaned me the Polaroid and I scanned it in as a pdf and a gif file. It is the strangest picture I have ever seen."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.02224","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Cuba","Longitude":"-106.958372","Region":"New Mexico","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/30/1981 12:00 UTC","Summary":"odd photo","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.02224,+-106.958372(11441)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11441) map </A>","Case Number":"11441","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11441.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11441_submitter_file1__tonyincuba.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11441.html"],"Object Shape":"Flash","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07062008-0001","Date of the Event":"11/30/1981 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
