As I closed my door I looked up over the top the car to the southeast and observed 3 lights forming a triangle in the sky. The lights stayed on and did not blink. I was able to determine that the object that the lights were attached to was dark and triangular shaped. The object seemed fairly large. When I first observed the object it was hovering. I watched it for what seemed to be 30 seconds. All of a sudden the lights flashed very brightly and the object took off at a very high rate of speed. I also heard a \"whooshing\" sound that did not sound like a helicopter or airplane. I immediately came in and told my father, who suggested that I send this report to you."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43707.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43707.html"],"Log Number":"US-11042012-0020","City":"Herculaneum","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Witnessed a triangula shaped object in the sky with three lights on it.","Latitude":"38.239541","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Case Number":"43707","Date Submitted":"11/04/2012 10:44 UTC","Longitude":"-90.403764","Tags":"City"}
