Out of the corner of my eye I saw bright lights out of my bedroom window. When i looked over the lit up object was dropping in height very quickly. I thought i was seeing a plane crash. It looked unussually close for a plane and was so loud I could hear it. I stood up and got closer to the window and it stopped dropping and hovered for a couple seconds. I noticed its ring of lights and its strange, hollow-like (saturn-like), shape. Within seconds it took off into the fog like a slingshot and I could see the lights disapearing in the distance. Once i realized what i just saw i woke up my boyfriend and brother in a panic. I went over it in my head trying to find another explanation, but there isnt one. It seemed like it came out of a movie and i couldnt believe what i had just saw."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Saturn-like","Case Number":"26383","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Maple Shade","There were no other sightings in Maple Shade on or around November 4th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.952222,+-74.994722(26383)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26383) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"39.952222","Summary":"Bright lights, lowered in sky then hovered and took off like a sling shot.","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Date Submitted":"11/05/2010 03:24 UTC"}
