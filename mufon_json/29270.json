It VERY quickly elevated and traveled out of sight, while seemingly close to us, and made no sound. We then witnessed 3 more of these appear out of the same spot, and follow more or less the same 'flight pattern', except one that hovered, blinked, and lost elevation, before rapidly going up again. We were on a rooftop and could see these would leave from a neighborhood not very far away, and would be out of sight within a minute."]}
