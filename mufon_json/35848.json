I stopped my vehicle at the top of a high point in the road with my windows down and shut off my motor. As the object got closer i was in near direct path of it. as it went over just ahead of my vehicle (if i had to guess between 400-500ft above) i realized it was triangular in shape. It had white lights on all three sides and i could see all three sides as if it were on an slight axis. there were very low clouds due to heavy rain, it made no sound and was headed in a north west direction at a steady rate of speed. I saw no stars in the night sky, not even the moon, it was heavy overcast which on approach lead my to believe it was a helicopter. I am not 100% but it appeared to be moving in a slow, steady rotational motion as it went by in a direct line. I tried to follow it but it was heading in a direction i was not able to follow, nw. all roads in the area are east west, north south."],"Date of the Event":"02/14/2012 09:30 UTC","Summary":"Triangular shaped, under clouds (rainy night),no sound, blue glow coming from center","Log Number":"US-02162012-0009","Tags":"City","City":"Oxford Charter Township","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35848.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35848.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"35848","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.847329"}
