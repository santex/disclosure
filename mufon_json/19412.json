There were no clouds. I saw something and mentioned it. We all looked up. Before us was an unexplainable sight. There was an intense bright light high in the sky. It was very high and very bright. Beneath this light was a cone shape of light, as if it was a flashlight pointing from space. There was a fog or a smoke being illuminated by this light. The bright light disappeared. Then the smoke slowly dissipated, leaving no trace. Within 30 seconds all that was left was the clear night sky."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 08:45 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19412.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19412.html"],"trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 2 other sightings in New York on or around September 19th 2009"]}
