It was pretty high in the sky. We were near the Moutardier campground. We thought maybe it was a planet because we had already seen a planet in the sky earlier. It was a very clear sky no clouds. We were out looking for shooting stars. When we first saw it it was orangish red, then after a min or 2 it was more yellowish in color then it was gone. It did not appear to be moving to us, it stayed in the same position the whole time we saw it. Maybe 3 mins total. I have never seen anything like this before"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.486844,+-86.286564(25024)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25024) map </A>","Latitude":"37.486844","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other"}
