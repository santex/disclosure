I could not imagine what it was. As I watched it come closer I could see it had two lights on the body with a flashing light inbetween. The color of the lights were kind of amber. It did not have red and white flashing lights, FAA regs. It was flying in a straight line.I could see a jet flying in the background and I could faintly hear the jet sound, but this object that was closer made no sound that I could hear. I live in the mountains and it was a quiet nite. I can't tell you how high or how far it was but I can say it was defintly over my valley. I should have heard something. I watched the object and its large beem of light until it flew out of sight. I have seen a ufo during the day and I know they exsist! I'am pretty sure this was my second sighting."],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"44999","Latitude":"40.095557","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/03/2013 08:31 UTC","City":"Granby","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01032013-0033","Source":"MUFON"}
