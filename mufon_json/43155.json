I walked by my sliding glass door in my kitchen and a light caught my eye. I looked out the window and noticed a bright white pulsating light hovering in the SE direction, probably close to a mile away. At first I thought is was a light on a tower, I checked this morning in daylight and there is no tower in that area. I did see planes pass by and could tell this object was not a plane. I watched the object for 10 minutes and it just continued to pulsate and was almost like a diamond shape the more I looked at it. I then went to my bedroom to get my phone so i could get a picture. When I came back it was gone. I looked in the sky for about 15 minutes hoping it would come back. I did see a shooting star and a small plane flying towards the direction the object was at. I really do think that something was there. Whether its e.t or government."],"Log Number":"US-10112012-0013","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Erlanger","There were no other sightings in Erlanger on or around October 10th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"38.985042","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.591971","Region":"Kentucky","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/11/2012 10:03 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"Glowing object pulsated in white with red-orange pulsating on bottom.
