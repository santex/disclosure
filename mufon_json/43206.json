I had my friend tell me how he was looking at the google earth for destin Fl, and in the Pass of the bridge is an invisible ? in the water causing a huge wake, and draw. There are boats all around with shadows being cats, it is not. So why is it not showing anything, or casting a shadow? Its wake is 30 times larger than the other large boats in the area including the coast guard boat. Is it possible just this one item didnt show up, yet the entire rest of the area is perfectly clear? Is it a new type of paint placed on a water vehicle that the gov has made to not show up? I mean it is close to Hurlburt, and Eglin afb. I find it very odd at best. Let me know what you think, and Then I would like to go into many of my stories from living here over the years. Its almost an every night thing here>>>"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43206.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43206.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"Region":"Florida","Country":"United States","Latitude":"27.671647"}
