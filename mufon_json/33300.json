It was a very large bright white object hovering less than 500 feet from the ground. It had appendages coming off of it and several other objects, which were balls of a duller white light going to and from the larger object. It looked like the smaller ones were docking with the larger craft, then leaving it. The smaller objects moved around the sky and went down to the ground and out of sight. I watched this for approximately 7 minutes, then called to report this. The MUFON investigator told me to go inside to get my camera to get some photos but when I returned the smaller objects were all gone. My camera batteries were dead. I watched the larger object for several more minutes but it did not move. I got the dog and went inside because I started to feel anxious, then went back out again a few minutes later and the object was gone."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/12/2011 12:54 UTC","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","City":"Raymore","Summary":"Large stationary circular UFO with appendages and other objects moving to and from it","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Raymore","There was one other sighting in Raymore on or around November 11th 2011"]}
