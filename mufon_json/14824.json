My wife and kids were wandering around. I saw a star in the sky that was brighter than any of the other ones. I watched it for a while and it didn't move. It just pulsed brighter then darker. It finally started flying away. It didn't look like any of the other stars. I asked the guy next to me about it but he didn't speak English. It was a good place for sightings. I didn't freak out or anything though because I've seen them before especially up there because the view is so good. They never cease to amaze me though. When your watching it's like you just go into another world."],"Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-118.235825","City":"Los Angeles","Latitude":"34.059514","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around January 7th 2009"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"01/07/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Saw star in sky that moved.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14824.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14824.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"01/07/2009 12:00 UTC"}
