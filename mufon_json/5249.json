I was looking at the clouds and saw this thing in the clouds that I thought was a plane at first. I began to watch it move erratically. Stopping, going backwards quickly, then going forward again. Then it went through a cloud made a very quick turn to the south west and accelerated very fast till it was out of view. It was cigar shaped, metallic, looked like a silver color. It was rounded at the corners. Looked like it could maneuver very well. Way more than any commercial or military aircraft I have seen. Made no sound. That I would hear out the screens of the window anyway. I lost track of it when it accelerated to the South West very fast and went beyond my scope of view(trees)."],"Latitude":"43.146749","City":"Pembroke","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/13/2006 10:45 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
