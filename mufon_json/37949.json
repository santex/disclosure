Then we looked straight up above us. At first I thought I was looking at a constellation. The strange formation of about 16 lights moved extremely fast and never changed its formation. There was no sound. My husband had run into the house to grab the video camera. In about the 10 seconds it took for him to come back out they traveled too far out of range for him to capture it. They were traveling from west to east and I continued staring until I just couldn't see them anymore."],"Date Submitted":"05/06/2012 10:48 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Glendale","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-112.202411","Log Number":"US-05062012-0007","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.704448","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37949.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37949.html"]}
