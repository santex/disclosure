{"Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Diamond, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Longitude":"-80.207052","Latitude":"25.758096","divs":["Sighting DetailsAbout 7:00 pm, my neighbors and I were doing a barbecue outside my home while the kids were riding their scooters. We noticed right over us a bright orange flying object that looked like it was on fire. It was hovering right over us and it seemed it was descending. We were scared because we thought it was a plane on fire but it just stayed on top of us for about 5 minutes. Then it elevated and got lost in the sky. About 10 minutes later, another object came by, the same way. It hovered again over us for about 5 minutes then it \"flew\" to the south and it seemed to descend but again got lost in the night sky. It was not a plane or any other type of aircraft. Bright orange and very fiery like. Once it stopped hovering, it disappeared at very high altitude and speed. We had never seen anything like this. We live in the middle of the city. My camera is not a good quality digital camera but this is what I was able to capture."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"01/04/2013 09:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-01042013-0020","Case Number":"45023","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"01/04/2013 07:00 UTC","City":"Miami","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45023.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45023.html"],"trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around January 4th 2013"],"Summary":"Bright orange lantern type (2) about 10 minutes apart hovered then sped away over our house","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.758096,+-80.207052(45023)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45023) map </A>"}
