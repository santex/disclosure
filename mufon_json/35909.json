The jets were still flying around the next day, so decided to film them as they flew around. On Feb 16,2012 I was out in the early evening filming when I transfered my shots to check them out, I noticed that there were objects flying by these jets. I did not notice them while filming.I do not know what the triangular craft was that I saw, But it was not any kind of aircraft using jet engines, It was moving way slower than a small plane, and there was no sound from it at all. As for the objects in the film, I have know idea."],"Region":"Idaho","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35909.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35909.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-02182012-0008","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"02/16/2012 07:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/18/2012 11:29 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.58144,+-116.206211(35909)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35909) map </A>","Longitude":"-116.206211","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"observed triangle shaped object moving slowly, filmed objects flying near fighter jets","City":"Boise","Case Number":"35909","Latitude":"43.58144","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There was one other sighting in Boise on or around February 16th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle, Unknown"}
