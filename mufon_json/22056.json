I was in awe on how bright it was and all of a sudden I heard a puff sound followed by a counterclockwise spiral of a plume of smoke. As the plume of smoke made three full spirals an object shot out westward from the smoke, stopped as to get its composer for about three seconds, then shot northwest at an incredible speed. I was able to see the object for another two seconds til I lost it in the shadows of the night. I have been around aircrafts a good part of my life but never did I encounter anything like this. I like to admit I first thought it was an acrobatic aircraft but when I saw the object literally shoot out into view from the smoke and it stopped in mid air. The object had a round pod shape, I knew then we don't have anything that manuevers like that. This happened in late May or the first week of June in the year 2004."],"Date Submitted":"02/28/2010 06:30 UTC","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.60306,+-87.340947(22056)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22056) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Gary","There were no other sightings in Gary on or around June 1st 2004"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.60306","Disposition":"Unknown"}
