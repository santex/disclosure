I live right next to a small airport, so when I saw the craft fly by, I noticed only how odd it looked. It looked like two of the older style street lights attached. It flew by at single engine aircraft speed, with no sound. If it was a single engine craft, I would not have heard it at that attitude. After giving thought that it had no blinking lights, aircraft I see at night always have blinking lights, kinda like having your headlights on at night. blinking lights are to be expected. I'm hoping that someone could come up with what I had seen. I have reported sightings before, that Mufon has declared to be unidentifiable. So I do believe that my area can generate the unusual."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-122.182885","Log Number":"US-08032012-0014"}
