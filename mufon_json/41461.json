It was travelling with another object smaller and roundish in a southesterly direction, small object vanished,large cigar shaped object stopped, then suddenly small object was on other side of cigar shaped object, and moving in a northwesterly direction with cigar shaped object following it. essentially going back the same way they had come from. all of this took about 5-6 mnutes. I yelled at my wife who grabbed a camera and got the pictures on the return path heading northwesterly. They just vanished then. Looked to be very far away. Felt it could not be planes-they would not travel so close together and in the same line."],"Longitude":"-88.365258","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Elgin","There were no other sightings in Elgin on or around August 5th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Log Number":"US-08052012-0027","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41461_submitter_file1__IMG4507.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41461_submitter_file2__aug520121222pm2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41461.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/05/2012 06:13 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.022839,+-88.365258(41461)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41461) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/05/2012 12:22 UTC","City":"Elgin","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
