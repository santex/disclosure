My college roommate and I choose to go for an afternoon road trip. We were driving to back to Alpine, Texas on Highway 118 driving North. From the time we left Study Butte, Texas we noticed a red light in the North Eastern direction in the mountains. My roommate ( I will not divulge his name at this time, I do have his consent, and do not know his current location ) commented to me it was a fire, and I reply, ���With fires you will only see light from the edges���. As we got closer we could clearly identify the shape as a parabola as it was hovering in air about 500ft to 1000ft, and a solid bright red glowing light that covered the complete under belly of the object. I stopped the truck to relieve myself and to watch the object. As I fixed my eyes on a nearby electrical pole I could see the object moving from the left to right. Their was no sound associated with the movement of the object. The object was at least 500ft to 1000ft in width. At that time, we both got back into the truck and drove to the north back to Alpine. I felt fear during the sighting, and wanted to leave the area as soon I could. My roommate keep a strict record of the time, and started to tune in FM and AM radio stations from Alpine and Odessa, Texas. There was none of the standard phenomenon that is reported with such a sighting such as radio, electrical, or time distortion. On our way back to Alpine, we both noticed an Owl sitting on the fence, and we both knew what the owls represents in sightings. The hair on the back of our necks stood up. As we approached the boarder patrol check point we found it vacant. I have no clue on the origins of this craft we both saw, I���ve was raised around aviation, and know this was nothing I have ever seen before or after."],"Case Number":"26474","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.081968,+-107.284684(26474)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26474) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Study Butte","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"03/21/1993 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-11092010-0023"}
