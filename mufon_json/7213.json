For starters, it scared me when it happened and I am still a little confused as to what it was. The first of the video has something in it at about 5-10 seconds. Call it a rod, call it a bug��� I don���t know. I do know that I have taken about 4 videos of very strange fast moving (bug like) objects. I will attach another video of what I mean. Now skip forward to 1:15 in the video. Sorry for the long delay but I wanted to show that the ���rod��� was captured in the same video. I am still an amateur, using a new camera. I wish I would have spent more time on trying to video what I was seeing but you will still see what happened. I was filming to the northeast on Friday April 13th about midnight. There was a strange feeling in the air that night. From a distance appeared 15-20 lights moving from east to west. These object were illuminated some how. They were not birds and they were defiantly not bugs on any type. When trying to adjust my camera I clicked off the inferred button. By the time I get readjusted, you can see the objects almost directly north of my home. Another fast moving object passes by flying south to north. Wish I new what they were. hsibilly@hotmail.com"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/13/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"7213","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.452377","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There was one other sighting in Phoenix on or around April 13th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7213.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Phoenix","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-112.068387","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown"}
