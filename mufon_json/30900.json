My fiance then grabbed my attention to a large white fireball that was emitting pieces out the back. This object was pretty far off in the distance, decending in a South, south west direction. The entire show lasted for around 4-6 seconds approximetely. I started to question myself and think of what it could have been. There was no noise, no sonic boom of anykind (at the rate it was going and for as large as it was, there is no doubt it would have made one). It was not up in the atmosphere, it was below and close! Not close to where it would cause a panic, but close enough to see the discharging of small white \"Ambers\" come from the back of it. I couldn't be sure of what it really was, but it was quite exciting to see it."],"Date Submitted":"08/14/2011 06:43 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"41.255645","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-75.871738","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Case Number":"30900","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None, Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Wilkes-Barre","There were no other sightings in Wilkes-Barre on or around July 23rd 2011"],"Log Number":"US-08142011-0011","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/23/2011 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
