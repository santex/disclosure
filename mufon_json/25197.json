The same object that ive seen on several ocations. again traveling from west to east and again for the second time in 2 nights traveled over DIA Airport in Denver. The object looks like jupiter in shape and brightness and moves very slowly in a strait line. (seams to zig zag slightly, but could be an optical allusion). I checked J Track and found no satalites or HST at that time. I am wondering if J Track is showing real time, or something els. But after checking many posabilities of satalite movement I still didnt find any thing with the same trajectory as the object that I saw. Is any one els seeing this object."],"Summary":"Bright object moving slowly from west to east, unknown altitude.","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"25197","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25197.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25197.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.557361,+-105.780027(25197)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25197) map </A>","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"09:30:00"}
