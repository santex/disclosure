{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI am attaching a pictures extracted from the video sequence submitted for the Sept 30th, UFO. This picture was quite a good one, so I decided to enhance it further for detail. I put this picture through several techniques to enhance the image for detail. The laundry list of enhancements is as follows: 1. Applied a super-resolution technique to use multiple frames of the UFO (it paused a few times in flight for microseconds) via the software package QE Super-resolution to increase the resolution of the picture. 2. Applied bicubic resampling to further increase the resolution of the original image using \"IRIS\" free astronomy software. IRIS software is used by astronomy professionals to enhance pictures of stars and constellations. 3. I applied wavelet algorithms from the IRIS package to further increase the resolution of the picture. 4. I applied the open source GIMP software, specifically the GIMP \"NEON\" EDGE detection algorithm to improve the picture to the point where a truly alien looking vehicle emerged from the originally blurry picture. Please see attached pictures to see the sequence of these improvements."],"Latitude":"53.934401","trends":[""],"Country":"Canada","Case Number":"13101","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13101.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13101.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.934401,+-116.566594(13101)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13101) map </A>","Longitude":"-116.566594","Summary":"Update to September 30 report","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-10192008-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Alberta","Date of the Event":"09/30/2008 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/30/2008 12:00 UTC"}
