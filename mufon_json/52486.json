I am in Memphis, TN, I was just out in my backyard taking my dog out and I swear I saw something I can not explain! I have no evidence or other witness, but I swear I just saw at about 10:20pm a ring of lights that seemed to be in a fog, they turned from horizontal to vertical, first headed East, then when they turned vertical, they went North across the sky. They seemed to be in a fog, or a mist....if I hadn't looked at the right moment, I would have missed them....I can not believe I am sitting here on Thanksgiving night having just seen something so crazy! I am not asking you to believe me, just please please tell me if you hear a similar report from anybody else!"],"Date Submitted":"11/29/2013 12:33 UTC","Case Number":"52486","Date of the Event":"11/28/2013 10:20 UTC","Region":"Tennessee","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52486.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52486.html"],"Longitude":"-90.04675","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","City":"Memphis","Log Number":"US-11292013-0002"}
