Objects seen are described as metallic spheres, often observed shining light beams down to the ground below. Three family members (mother, son, and uncle) state that these spheres often move from very high up in the atmosphere down to several hundred feet of where the observers are standing on the ground. There are sometimes 3 or 4 of these spheres present at the same time. Two of the family members (uncle and son) have shone flashlights and an astronomical green laser pointer at the spheres, and it is their opinion that the spheres have responded by shining their own beams back at them and by swooping down as if to take a closer look at the humans. The son expresses fears about continuing to signal the objects and states that he is concerned about what the objects might do to his family as a result of the signalling."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Recurring sightings of metallic spheres since June 2009.","Log Number":"US-01132010-0008"}
