It was if it was watching the game too. I know it was there for a good time because I would watch the game for a bit and look back and it would still be there, then some good play would happen and I would go back to watching the game. The next time I looked it was gone. So it was there for about 10 min. I know others were aware of it but didn't make much to do about it and egnored the object. This is not my first incouter and was in the Air Force for a few years and know the capabilities of our aircraft and this was not our aircraft."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.666283","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.984692,+-96.666283(31672)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31672) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Calvert","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31672.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31672.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/09/2011 05:01 UTC"}
