While stopped and looking up at about a 45 degree angle though my windshield I noticed a flashing object at a very high altitude. There were no contrails associated with the flash. The flash was similar to a reflection of light from a mirrored object. It only lasted 4-5 seconds and there was no sign of any other activity as I continued to scan the sky. I am an aircraft enthusiast and quite frequently look to the skies for navy aircraft that train in our area."],"City":"Jacksonville","Summary":"Flash at high altitude with no contrails","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10272008-0025","Weather Factors":"Medium","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown"}
