When I think about it, I look out to see if there's any unique objects in the sky. Earlier today, I noticed one object that I'm now believing to be a star, but when I got my video camera to film it, I noticed a previously unseen object next to it that changed shape numerous times. This second object was grey in color and partially transparent. The second object did not move, but was in its place. After roughly three minutes, I had zoomed out on the video to please disbelievers that it wasn't some flashlight on a wall. When I zoomed back in, using the first object as a guiding point, the second object had disappeared. I have video if available, but I cannot transfer it to my laptop at this time (no firewire cable). If interviewed, I will bring the video camera."],"trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Queen Creek","There were no other sightings in Queen Creek on or around June 16th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17515.html"],"City":"Queen Creek","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Two objects; one may have been a star (unsure); other changed shape constantly.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"17515","Longitude":"-111.633289","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Object Features":"None"}
