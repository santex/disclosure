After I got done mowing the two yards. I loaded my commercial mower on my trailer and went home. After I got home. I drive my mower off of my trailer and pulled it up to my carport. I raised my mower with my hands and put a jack stand in front of my commercial mower to hold the front of it up so I could wash the wet grass off of my mower after I got done washing the grass off of my mower I had to clean up the wet grass it was getting dark so I got my flood light and turn it on so I could see better. I took a shovel and started shoveling the wet grass up and carrying it across the road and throwing it over in the woods I happen to look up. I thought I was looking at a star then I saw a plane going toward the star then the star started to move away from the plane then the object vanishes while I was looking up at the object but the plane keep on going if flew over when the object vanish."],"Summary":"i was walking toward the road i spotted a ufo hovering then it took off","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23341.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23341.html"]}
