I looked to the north and there was a disc like domed object hovering about one-half mile east of the Mesquite Airport. The craft was approximately five hundred feet above the ground. According to a map it was approximately 2460 feet from my position. I pulled my car over to the side of the road and watched the object for about two minutes. It did not move and it made no noise. It was sidewalk gray and reminded me of a pith helmet. After about two minutes in the hovering mode it departed in the northerly direction and within one to two minutes it had disappeared completely. It was the most incredible thing that I have ever seen. From my position it was about one inch wide and a half inch thick.
