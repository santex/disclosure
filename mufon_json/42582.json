that was the entire length of time it took these objects to disappear from my line of sight\\field of view..i did do some investigating and made a few inquiries into observable satelites\\paths\\positions and i did discover that in the nw quadrant of my viewing area that at 4:40 a.m. eastern standard time a positioned satelite had deployed(opened) an irridium solar panel at the time of my sighting.furthermore,the suns' positioning relative to the angle of the earths' curvature would have been sufficient to have reflected off of the solar panel and created the flash that i witnessed.this eliminated in my mind a lot of the wild ideas that immediately came to mind from watching too many episodes of star trek, battlestar gallactica,star wars,etc. my first thought was that they had \"jumped\" to warp speed or hyper-drive or what-ever...i've always had a wild imagination but i am not given to exageration or half or untruths.i saw what i saw.i have never in my life ever told anything like this and i am quite confident that i could take a polygraph or any other test and it would show that i am being completely truthful.i am not on any meds(except for my heart) never been diagnosed with any mental disorders...my wife might beg to differ though....never had any halucinations or heard voices or etc;etc;etc....i am curious though if any one else saw what i did.i also wonder if our gov't. tracked them or if neos had any info....or tracking info...that's about it.i wish i had an exciting story to tell but this was and is exciting enough for me to believe that this was of an intelligent design\\happening....unless someone can add an irrefutable explanation for what i witnessed .thanks for your time to read this. 9 truthful"],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Oval","Tags":"City","City":"Toledo"}
