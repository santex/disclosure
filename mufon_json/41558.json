The lights formed a triangle-like shape and hovered over the middle school for 28 minutes. Two of the bottom lights appeared to move slightly from left to right and didn't stray too far away from the top light. It remained in it's triangle-like shape and many planes were flying near it during the sighting. I made many attempts to capture it on film with a photo camera and a video camera and nothing appeared on them. I could see them very clearly using binoculars. The lights were orange-yellowish and reddish in color and appeared to be flickering. The top light however, was white in color and didn't flicker or move. The lights disappeared at 1948 and more planes appeared after."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"41558","Latitude":"33.589749"}
