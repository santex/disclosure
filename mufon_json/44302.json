She brought it to bed with me and I was afraid that she might go to the bathroom so I decided to take her out. We walked around behind my home, which I live out in the country, and then to the front of the house where I noticed the object. It was hovering above my neighbor's field just above the treetops. There was no noise no movement, just stationary with about 6 orangey-red lights glowing around it. It took about 30 seconds for me to realize what I was staring at and I grabbed the puppy and went into the house. I did not wait outside to see how it left."],"Case Number":"44302","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.307451,+-85.216244(44302)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44302) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/03/2012 10:32 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44302.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44302.html"],"Latitude":"39.307451","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Batesville","Date of the Event":"12/02/2012 02:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-12032012-0003","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Disk like object with 6 orange/red lights around it hovering in field near home."}
