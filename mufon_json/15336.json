I was trying to decide if it was a planet when another one appearred next to it, then another. They then faded out one at a time. this was repeated 3 or 4 times.The final time there were six or seven lights. Each time the lights appeared one at a time. The lights didn't appear to move across the horizon. When I first noticed the lights I just studied them for a bit. When I realized it wasn't a planet or a plane I was surprised and excited. My husband was coming outside and I asked him to hurry, he needed to see this. He saw 2 or 3 of the lights and ran back in to the house for a camera and binoculars. They were gone before he got back. I am so very sorry we didn't get a picture. I hope you believe me."],"City":"Stephenville","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 3 other sightings in Stephenville on or around February 5th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"02/05/2009 07:45 UTC"}
