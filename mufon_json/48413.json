A friend and I were outside on his patio and I noticed a bright orange light flying over us. It seemed way too quick to be an airplane and the orange glow around it was very bright. I took a video on my phone but unfortunately, there is no zoom so on the video it just looks like an orange dot. We also noticed that the object seemed very silent. A plane went by in the opposite direction shortly after and you could tell it wasn't moving nearly as fast as the orange object. Also this may be a coincidence but when we went back inside after the object had passed, the satellite TV had lost it's signal for a short time on an otherwise clear evening."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Date Submitted":"06/25/2013 06:46 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
