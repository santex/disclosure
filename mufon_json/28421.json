I first thought they were birds, but then realized that I couldn't see birds up that high. There were 3 triangular shaped objects with circular patterns on each of the corners. They were flying in circular motions, it was then that I realized I was seeing something abnormal. I ran in the house to get my girlfriend so she could see. When we returned outside, 2 of the objects were gone and one was still there, hovering in the sky. About a minute later a jet, traveling at a very high rate of speed approached the object and the object just vanished. The jet then circled around the area for about 5 minutes afterwards and left the area."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Prescott","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03272011-0007","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"44.191964"}
