{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I were staying at a hotel in Hollywood, CA, as we stood on the balcony facing the east, looking up at the sky we saw (what looked like) two planes that looked as if they were going to crash into each other. Only the one on the left that was blinking colored (red blue white) lights suddenly stopped in mid air for a second then reversed in the exact opposite direction that it came from. It did not turn around -- it just suddenly changed course from the direction it came then speed away toward downtown LA. No craft that I am aware of can stop mid air then change direction so quickly. Did anyone else see this??"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15005.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15005.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","City":"Los Angeles","Date of the Event":"01/14/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01192009-0010","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around January 14th 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15005","Longitude":"-118.319731","Disposition":"Hoax","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.096559,+-118.319731(15005)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15005) map </A>","Summary":"UFO in the sky in Hollywood CA.","Date Submitted":"01/14/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.096559"}
