I was feeling spaced out and paranoid that day, which might have been due to having a nephrite jade bracelet on. The reason I went outside was to recollect myself from the spaciness I was having. Then I looked up and this thing was there right over my head with some writing on it. I forget what the writing was. It wasn't much higher than the garage building which was a typical steel warehouse style building. I want to say this was the ceiling fan UFO. I'm not sure if I had heard about the ceiling fan UFO before or after this encounter though. When I first saw it I felt it was military. The way it made me feel: That \"they\" know who I am and what I've been up to. I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it but no one was there. Then it was gone next time I looked. It was around this time that I started to have had a lot of ringing in my ears and also deja vu."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23812.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/18/2010 05:23 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"23812","Summary":"Spaced out feeling and then I see it over my head.","City":"Colonie","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.830385","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Log Number":"US-06182010-0007","Date of the Event":"05/15/2006 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
