{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was preparing for bed and decided to have a cigarette out on my patio, when I noted an circular object in the sky to my right. At first I thought it was an airplane,though it looked strange, ie the lights were twirling around the aircraft unlike a plane. Then I focus carefully and became slightly frighten, but thought to myself, \"you have seen this before approx. 30 years ago in Wickliffe,Ohio and the aircraft back then just hovered above my car while I was parking or driving into my drive way and no harm came to my children or myself. So, I just peered at it while it moved side to side for approx. 2 to 3 minutes, then it zoomed away."],"Latitude":"38.362717","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/03/2009 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Vacaville","There were no other sightings in Vacaville on or around June 3rd 2009"],"Longitude":"-121.982444","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Date Submitted":"06/03/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17524.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.362717,+-121.982444(17524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17524) map </A>","City":"Vacaville","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-06172009-0003","Case Number":"17524","Summary":"Circular saucer shape w/lights around the bottom edge rotating, and moving side to side."}
