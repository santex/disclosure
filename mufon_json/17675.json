{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside smoking a cigarette in my back yard, i thought it would be cool to see a UFO,then for some reason decided to look to my left and saw the object coming from mountain area. It climbed and hover on top my house for a long period of time, i decided to go upstairs and tell my wife, she saw it from the balcony. At this time it was really high but it was at times very bright, we could see it really easy, after that i decided to get my camera and take some pictures from the balcony wich i have. At this time i didnt realize it because i was using the lens of the camera but it started to decent slowly. I took video of it and when i took video it was decending into the city, i lost it when it decended behind some trees. Maybe it was a smart weather ballon if such things exist!"],"Case Number":"17675","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw it coming from Lax area, climbed, hover and then it decended to city.","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-115.163706","Date Submitted":"06/26/2009 01:05 UTC","Region":"Nevada","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17675.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17675.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around June 26th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"36.117226","Log Number":"US-06262009-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.117226,+-115.163706(17675)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17675) map </A>","City":"Las Vegas","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/26/2009 01:05 UTC"}
