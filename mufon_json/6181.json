It was right outside of my window moving at a slow, steady pace. It was as large as the wing of the plane with a metallic body, a silver nose, and without wings. It was very close to the top of the plane and flew directly over my head. Behind it was a white stream of smoke. I do not think anyone else noticed it, as most people were sleeping or focused on something else. Because I didn't want to alarm anyone, I did not go to the other side of the plane to see it. I was not sure what I saw, so I didn't say anything until I realized what I saw was, in fact, a UFO. I will mail my sketches"],"trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There was one other sighting in Nashville on or around December 17th 2006"],"Date Submitted":"12/17/2006 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"36.17563","Case Number":"6181","Region":"Tennessee","Summary":"The object appeared out of nowhere in the sky from an airplane window.
