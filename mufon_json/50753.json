{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Latitude":"28.713652","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving EAST on Lester rd in Apopka, FL. It was about 7:35pm the sun was setting behind me and you could see the sunlight on the tips of the clouds to my east. Out of nowhere a bright light was ascending upwards leaving a light trail and you could see the clouds bending around it. There wasn't a clear view because it never came out of the clouds. It was if it was on the edge of the clouds. I lost sight because was stopped at a stop sign and a car came behind me and once i turned i lost sight of it. I was shocked because i could see it very clearly the light and the light trail it was leaving. I have a video but its very blurry due to the auto focus would not lock in on it."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Apopka","There were no other sightings in Apopka on or around September 10th 2013"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/10/2013 07:35 UTC","City":"Apopka","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Log Number":"US-09112013-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50753.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50753.html"],"Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"50753","Summary":"Saw a bright object ascending leaving a light trail and bending the clouds around it.","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.713652,+-81.533821(50753)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50753) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/11/2013 06:44 UTC","Longitude":"-81.533821"}
