(center for employment training ) and was working on my second job after taking second course(1st job was at watxxxs johxxxn) after going back to school to add to my studies (microwave theory)- (my studies where in electronic eng.)@ telxxxne micxxxxve in palo alto. i was drivng from hollister california where i had just played music for an outdoor party ( friends party) and was on my way to play another party in san jose california, i remeber i was suppose to arrive at the party about 8 pm so i left hollister about 6-6:30 ( i was running late). the sun was coming down, and weather was changing as i drove in gilroy california. i took 156 hwy to 101 hwy north ( had to pick up extra equipment in san juan baustist (my home). just after passing morgan hill i noticed a bright blue\\red light traveling along my side, i figured about 1-2 mile on my left side. at first i thought a helicopter because a plane wouldn't be flying that low, it look like it was flying about my speed then it shot 2-3 mile in front of me in an instant. i didn't relize this at first, i just thought oh these guys turned off there lights. as drove on i saw the light again in a field near a small lake but i notice it wasn't moving so i slowed down. then something amazing happen: the disc light up and you could see the disc shape semi oval with what at first didn't notice small windows in the center area. the bottom half of the disc look like it was rotating and the top light seem to dim down so i could see the size of it ( size of a football field). i almost lost it (driving) becuse i could beleive what i was seeing, then just as quick as it light up again it shut it light off again and moved another 2-3 mile ahead ( i knew this becuse this time there was nothing to block my view-mountain, hills, trees). i then got kinda excited and keep thinking this is hoax, this can't be real, but how can a blimp travel so quickly, i speed up to finally catch up to it just outside of san jose california near tully road exit. i stopped my car along the side of the road and got off as the blinking light got closer, i could'nt see the disc just the lights. then suddenly just like the first time, again it stopped, no sound of engines no sound period, then the lights at the bottom lite up... only that then, i saw something i had not noticed the first time, the windows seemed much closer and i could see figures in the wondows walking back and forth from one side of the disc to the other.. i was in shock because i knew then that this wasn't a hoax, i don't know how long i was stareing but if it hadn't started raining i might have not snapped out of it. i jumped in my car and proceed to honk at passing car's to see if somebody was seeing what i was seeing, but started raining harder so i couldn't tell. just as i drove into san jose i decided to stop again because the disc lite up again and i was hoping somebody would stop with me. the disc had crossed over me and now was hovering on my right side at least 300-500 ft above the homes in the area, then i did hear a sound.. which at first i thought came from the disc but soon relized it wasn't. the disc shot straight up at incredible speed and the sound i hear was 2 jet fighters coming in fast and low, the came in above and shot up in the same direction the disc ( it was dark but i could see there after burners ( that how i know ther was 2 jets) direction and the last sound i heard was a sonic boom, i believe came from the 2 jet fighters i believe to have gone to mac speed. well, i got to party late (9-9:30) but most of the people there where allready a little tipsy so no one beleived me. its get better, i made a lot of phone calls the next day to military bases and police (moffet field around the corner) but there where no reports filed on that night on my siteing, i told my friends, co-workers, and bosses in telxxxne and the next day they had put a giant flyer in the warehouse with cartoon pictures of me and aliens saying\" jose's see's little green men\". year's later i was watching tv and a special came out about ufo and there was a picture draw by a man which decribed the same ufo i had seen, almost 10 years later. i was happy to see it, i knew then i wasn't seeing things."],"Region":"California","Log Number":"US-03222008-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10007.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10007.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10007.html"],"Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned Surface","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Morgan Hill","There were no other sightings in Morgan Hill on or around July 31st 1983","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/31/1983 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"10007","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash, Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/31/1983 12:00 UTC"}
