{"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-73.991527","divs":["Sighting DetailsI took a photo on the way over to a boating party held the 3rd Saturday of August every year. It was mostly a far shot of the boats anchored on the island. When I got home I transfered the photo from my cell phone to my computer and cropped most of the sea and sky away. Thats when I noticed this sky blue object over the island. Just for your information, this island is across the bay from Earle Ammunition base. It was to high in the sky for a balloon which I thought it was at first. I sent the photo on to someone that may have had better close-up program. Here is what I have if I am able to download photos If not then feel free to call or email me HelaineNJ@aol.com or 908-309-9449 Helaine Camacho"],"Log Number":"US-08222009-0016","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.40372","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18816_submitter_file1__08150914496.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18816_submitter_file2__somethinginsky.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18816_submitter_file3__0815091449a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18816.html"],"Case Number":"18816","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Highlands","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/15/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","Object Shape":"Blimp, Disc, Oval, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.40372,+-73.991527(18816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18816) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"When I took the photo I didnt even see it there.
