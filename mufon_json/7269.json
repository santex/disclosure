{"divs":["Sighting DetailsTwo objects that presented as planes moving quickly from North to South toward and partially across the zennith. The objects were moving in perfect unison perhaps three-four fingers of a fully extended arm apart. Conditions were perfectly clear and there were no navigation lights or other lights usually associated with aircraft. We were in a stopped car in the middle of a traffic jam when we noticed the two lights. Four of us saw these objects and were discussing it as it was happening. The interesting thing about these lights is that first the lead and then the following light faded out of view completely just after they crossed the zennith. We are all college educated and we all assumed the same thing at the same time: the objects appeared to leave the apmosphere and their light faded as they climbed. Definitely UFOs."],"Case Number":"7269","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hamilton City","There were no other sightings in Hamilton City on or around June 19th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Two airplane like objects moving quickly and in perfect tandom with no navigation lights.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Hamilton City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.74266,+-122.013591(7269)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7269) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7269.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7269.html"],"Longitude":"-122.013591","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/19/2007 10:45 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/19/2007 10:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.74266","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-06202007-0005","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
