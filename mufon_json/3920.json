I was relaxing in a chair on my outside second floor deck. 2. Bright object racing across the sky came into my view. 3. I thought it might be a meteor. 4. It was a silent fiery type ball that moved extremely fast and then disappeared. It did not come to the ground, or disappear behind something else, it simply faded into the still clear sky. 5. I jumped out of my chair and had to take my eye off of it for a split second (to avoid a table). When I looked up again it lasted another couple of seconds before it disappeared. 6.
