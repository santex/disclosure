It had two lights one on each end that could be seen. The craft blocked the light of distant stars as it flew between closer ones or at least this is how it appeared to me. As this ship neared the constellation scutum there was this bright flash of light it then moved directly toward were the flash appeared. It seemed as if the flash had created a hole and the craft seemed to travel into it. This sighting lasted approx. 5 minutes, it moved from north to south."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.607825,+-90.805129(5181)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5181) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.607825","Summary":"Very long craft moving through space with 2 visible lights.","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08032006-0002","Date Submitted":"08/01/2006 12:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-90.805129","Date of the Event":"08/01/2006 12:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Pittsfield","Case Number":"5181","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5181.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5181.html"]}
