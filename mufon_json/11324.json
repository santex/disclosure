There were no clouds in the ski so you could see the stars very well that night. We stood there for a few minuets looking south skiward when I noticed what appeared to be a Satellite travling northward towards us. It reached right over head and then made a sharp turn towards the west and shot off very fast. I can only describe the speed as like a shooting star. I don't know of any Satellite that can do that. If anyone has seen a Satellite at night it just looks like a star moving across the ski so you can emagine what this looked like."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/21/2006 11:00 UTC","Longitude":"-83.490772","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06272008-0005","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11324.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11324.html"],"City":"Commerce","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Commerce","There were no other sightings in Commerce on or around June 21st 2006"],"Latitude":"42.591143","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Michigan"}
