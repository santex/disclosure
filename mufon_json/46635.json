At first I was just thinking it might be a sattalite but then it stopped. It twinkled like a star then stopped moving,it twinkled again then took off at amazing speed toward the same direction it was heading before it stopped. There was no sound no vapor trail . Nothing I have ever seen has moved like that. I know I saw it it had to be in space because it was so little like the surrounding stars"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hawkins","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Latitude":"32.675471","Date Submitted":"04/06/2013 08:01 UTC"}
