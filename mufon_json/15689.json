Seemed to be moving in a West or Northwestern direction, slowly, but was clearly moving, Started as a equilateral triangle, but looked like it was turning, and then the triangle began to get tighter at the bottom, then return to a more equal triangle. after about ten minutes of watching this, the lights began to flicker out, one at a time, starting with the top or the triangle, then the right bottom, then finally the left bottom. My brother is the one who first saw it, he called me on his cell, he was on the 8 freeway heading east, when he called to tell me to go outside and check it out. I witnessed the lights , as well as my mom and my dad. I'm a 30 year old Security Guard, and have never seen anything like it., I'm still shocked and amazed at the same time.."],"Date Submitted":"02/24/2009 01:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Hoax","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"15689","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in El Cajon","There were no other sightings in El Cajon on or around February 24th 2009"],"City":"El Cajon","Latitude":"32.801943","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"-116.958827","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02242009-0004","Summary":"3 bright red lights, triangle shaped, slowly moving west / northwest, then slowly disappear.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15689.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15689.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/24/2009 01:15 UTC"}
