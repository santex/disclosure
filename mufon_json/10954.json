I thought maybe it was Venus, I looked at it and took several pics of it but with the digital camera I couldn't get a close enough shot. The object looks like a small cloud on what would be a cloudless morning. I snapped a picture of the moon also, I will send all that I have. I am sure the object was there longer then 5 minutes, but I had to leave for work. Also on Thursday, May 22nd, about 6:15 - 6:20 A.M. As I was pulling into the underground garage at my job, a black helicopter was flying low and very slowly in the vacinity of Roslyn, Long Island, New York."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
