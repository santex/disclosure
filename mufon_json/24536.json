I noticed a light that looked like static at first, and then a bright pure type of light that was constantly lit. It turned into two lights and appears to hover. It appeared to get brighter which made me think it was coming straight downward at me until if finally moved to my left which is South. The DEC was between 70 to 85. These two lights moved together slowly, then stopped for about 3 minutes and hovered when a commercial airplane going from West to East on the north side of my house.(assuming it was headed to DTW Airport) When it passed, these two lights moved again going slowly back to the North right over my head. It stopped again and the two lights merged together as one and it looked like the light winked out. There was no noise at all. I was upset with myself that I did not run to get my camera because I was afraid by time I got back it would have been gone. I have to say I got the worse static shock when I opened my slider door to get back in my bedroom. It shocked me so bad it freaked me out, it's probably unrelated, but it made me curious if it had anything to do with this siting. This lasted for about 5 minutes."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Ann Arbor","There were no other sightings in Ann Arbor on or around July 11th 2010"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/15/2010 01:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change"}
