The ,movie was \" last tango in paris. About a half hour into the movie one or more objects startet dashing back and forth across the sky at high velocities and seemingly high altitudes. Eventually they turned off the screen so everone could see better. At least a hundred people saw this. Everone got out of their cars to watch. Soon several jets appeared and chased them off to the northnwest. The action was all to the west, mover the screen, end seemed to move north and south. I've often thought of this over the years but have never seen any press on it. I need to findnout the dates the movie was playing at a drive-in in that area to further nail down the timeframe."],"Date Submitted":"07/22/2011 09:47 UTC","Case Number":"30305","Summary":"Flyover chased by jets","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.52984","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.52984,+-89.981924(30305)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30305) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-89.981924","Date of the Event":"10/05/1975 09:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07222011-0016"}
