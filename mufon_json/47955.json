I was lookin' at the stars, talkin' to my brother. All o' the sudden, a light that was too bright to be a star just appeared outta nowhere. It blinked and flashed randomly. In perspective, it looked to be about the size of an aspirin. It looked as if the surface was blue and green and flashing red and orange lights, then it took off towards the North East. It kinda freaked me out, but m' brother's a skeptic, he thought it was just a plane, but I ain't to sure o' dat."],"Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"00:01:01","City":"Burbank","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Pretty friggin' insane","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"06/07/2013 06:46 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"47955","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.256261,+-118.845421(47955)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47955) map </A>"}
