{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWas the height of a jetliner. Looked like a steady moving dull yellow ball, about the size of about 2-3 Jupiters (the current one visable in the evening western sky. No strobes, or any type running lights what-so-ever. Smooth, and steady speed. No residue, ie: a meteor burning. Stayed horizontal in reference to the ground. I didn't see it fade in the distance, because when I went to get field glasses, it was gone when I returned.
