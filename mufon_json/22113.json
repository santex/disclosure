I then noticed movement of an object moving in a south to north path. I thought it to be a satellite at first. I tracked it as it passed over this lasted for about 8 to ten mins. and then the light just disappeared, I thought that it was odd and maybe just an aircraft and that it had changed direction, but I should have still see the red and green marker lights. If it was a satellite the light should not have been so bright - the light from the object was like looking at head light of a car across a football field, not blinding but bright still - the object did not give me any feeling other than puzzlement of what it was."],"Log Number":"US-03032010-0014","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Colorado","City":"Grand Junction","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.07258","Date Submitted":"03/03/2010 10:05 UTC","Summary":"Looked like a satellite moving at mid orbit south to north orbit or lights on a aircraft then disappeared","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Grand Junction","There were no other sightings in Grand Junction on or around March 3rd 2010"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/03/2010 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Disposition":"IFO"}
