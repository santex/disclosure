The day he arrived I went to Walmart to get stuff to make a poster. A shiny object in the sky caught my attention. It was a silver sphere but it kept changing shape. More like a blob. As it changed it went from extremely shiny white to silver to total black. It moved erratically back, forth, and side to side. IT looked to be at least 15 feet across when it was in a spherical shape. Many other people in the parking lot were looking and pointing. After about 10 minutes it started heading to the right quickly until it was no longer visible."],"Summary":"Silver shape changing blob in Killeen, TX.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8232.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8232.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Killeen","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Killeen","There were no other sightings in Killeen on or around March 12th 2003"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.120489,+-97.725956(8232)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8232) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/12/2003 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"31.120489","Log Number":"US-10282007-0001","Longitude":"-97.725956"}
