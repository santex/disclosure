I looked up and saw three black orbs in the sky.I had know idea what it was. The orbs apeared to be floating around eachother. The orbs flew horizontaly. I'm guessing they flew about the hight of a normal airplane and about as fast. I was pretty exited about the sighting, I told the people in the neighbourhood and they saw it too. In total about 10 people in my neighbourhood saw the objects The sighting took pretty long but eventualy they flew out of sight. Extra info: I live near a airforce millitary base, frequently helicopters and f16's fly over."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.175652,+5.464082(12802)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12802) map </A>","Longitude":"5.464082","Case Number":"12802","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Gelderland","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hoevelaken","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"52.175652","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"07/11/1999 05:22 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/11/1999 05:22 UTC","Object Features":"None","City":"Hoevelaken","Tags":"City","Log Number":"NL-09272008-0003","Source":"MUFON","Country":"The Netherlands","Summary":"Three black orbs floating silently through the sky"}
