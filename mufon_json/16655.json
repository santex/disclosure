I immediately opened the blinds and observed the sphere from my upper level apartment balcony. The sphere was brighter than anything I have ever seen in the sky. The sphere appeared to be traveling directly (northeast) towards my apartment complex before stopping in the sky. The sphere appeared to sit motionless and soundless in the sky for approximately two minutes. I quickly grabbed my cell phone (Sprint Treo 800w) and took a photograph of the sphere as it sat motionless in the sky. I then ran to my vehicle and retrieved my video camera (Sony Mini-DV DCR-TRV950). At approximately 20:18 hours, I ran back up to my apartment���s balcony and began video taping the sphere in the sky. I video taped the sphere in the sky for approximately eleven minutes before it was out of view. During the eleven minutes, I did not observe the sphere flash or blink. I continued to observe the sky looking for the opportunity to see the sphere again. While looking to the west, I did notice another object, which appeared to be flat with lights across the front in the distance. This object was very far away and I could not see it in great detail, but flat with lights across the front is how I would describe it. I tried to video tape the object but it was to dark for my camera to reveal anything. I then called my mother informing her of what I had witnessed. I continued to monitor the object in the sky while talking to my mother on the phone when I observed a sphere like object appear in very close proximity of flat object. I sphere just appeared out of nowhere. The sphere appeared to sit motionless for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing, like shutting off a light switch. The sphere then reappeared in the same exact location approximately ten seconds later. The sphere held position for approximately 20-30 more seconds before disappearing completely. I maintained observation of the flat object for approximately two more minutes and noticed lights which appeared to be circling the object. It���s hard to be certain due to the distance, but that is how I would describe it. I lost visual of the object from my position as it appeared to be traveling west."],"City":"Elk Grove"}
