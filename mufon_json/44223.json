I had stopped for a minute to open a drink I had in the truck. My window was rolled down (always is when I do the security checks) and I looked straight up and saw a red-orange light zipping FAST from the south across the sky. It was headed in a northerly direction but slowly making a turn to the west at the same time. The object came to a complete stop before it zoomed off to the east and dissapeared. This thing was NOT a helicoptor or an airplane, it was way too high and going way to fast. It wasn't a meteorite or anything like that either, because I'm pretty sure that they dont stop and change directions. I have never seen anything like that in my life and I'm pretty familiar with lights in the sky. I enjoy star gazing and I'm familiar with satelites and airplanes and shooting stars, etc. I have no idea what that was, but I'd sure like to find out!"],"City":"Vancouver","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-11292012-0007","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around November 17th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"11/29/2012 02:27 UTC","Summary":"Glowing object going FAST from the south, came to complete stop, then headed east, Abrubt and fast changes","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44223.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44223.html"],"Latitude":"45.654521","Case Number":"44223"}
