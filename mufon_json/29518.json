The living room is oriented to east, with a large window allowing a view to the east. I glanced out the window into the darkened sky and noticed a bright star in view. I didn't think anything of it until I looked away, in my peripheral field I noticed a small amount of movement. I refocused and noticed it was on a straight trajectory from right to left in my field of vision. I noted the time and went outside and stood on my front doorstep. The object had moved slightly more to the left and continued its trajectory to the northeast. At the same time, I noticed an airplane flying above an behind the object, the plane appeared to be headed in the opposite direction and more to the southeast. I watched as the smooth movement of the object took it beyond the horizon. At no time did it slow or speed up. Nor did it blink or change colors. The star like appearance remained constant. The size and brightness of it was very comparable to other bright stars."],"Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Moving, silent star moving across sky","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Ganado","There were no other sightings in Ganado on or around June 12th 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:10"}
