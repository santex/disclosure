I love to look up at the stars because of their beauty. Then I saw something hovering over my house. I was going to get a camer, but I was scared that when I come back it would be gone. I thought it was a ufo when I first saw it because, I love reading about ufo's and this was amazing and such a wonderful moment for me. Anyways, It stayed still for about one minute and then it started moving at a fast speed. It went side to side, up and down, I didn't know what it was doing. I was so excited and scared at the same time, when I was the ufo. It was amazimg and I enjoyed it very much. After about eight minutes, it zoomed out of sight. I waited to see if it would come back for about three minutes, but it was cold outside, and I had to go back in. It was an amazing sight. Sorry, I don't have any videos and photos, just an eye witness, but if I do happen to catch a ufo on video or in pictures, this is the first sight that I will report it on!!!"],"trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around October 12th 2008"],"Region":"Tennessee","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13018.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.17539,+-86.780603(13018)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13018) map </A>","City":"Nashville","Date of the Event":"10/12/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I was outside of my house","Log Number":"US-10122008-0006","Case Number":"13018"}
