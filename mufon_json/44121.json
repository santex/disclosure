It went fast across the sky. A second one we saw it's complete movement across the sky. It was very close and everyone could tell easily that it was a candle and balloon setup. we waited to see another but it got too cold to stand out and watch. I'm sending this because I'm sure if you only saw the first it would be mysterious. I would guess that it was launched in Brtlett. It did travel with the wind."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Bartlett","There were no other sightings in Bartlett on or around November 22nd 2012"],"Longitude":"-88.20559","City":"Bartlett","Summary":"lit candle and balloon","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Case Number":"44121","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/24/2012 08:42 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.946993,+-88.20559(44121)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44121) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44121.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44121.html"],"Log Number":"US-11242012-0007","Object Features":"Other"}
