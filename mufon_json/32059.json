But when the object remained stationary, hovering and \"shapeshifting\" or maybe wobbling, I knew it was not a bird. It was not a plane, nor a helicopter, nor a balloon. There was no noise. At one point, during a duration of around 4 minutes, the sun reflected off the right side. It's shape at first was round, but then it was an odd shape. When it took off in a north west direction, it became flat, like a disc. It did not move off rapidly, but it didn't take long to be out of sight. I tried to take a picture with my phone camera, but I mistakenly forgot to save the shot. Don't know if I even got the object in my view finder. I believed it to be a UFO as I watched it with one other person. I was excited to have seen it, as I have seen two other UFO's in my lifetime, one with this same person."],"Date of the Event":"09/24/2011 04:53 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.669107,+-81.511634(32059)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32059) map </A>","Case Number":"32059","Longitude":"-81.511634","Date Submitted":"09/24/2011 09:21 UTC"}
