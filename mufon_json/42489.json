{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was lying in bed around 1 am EDT, when I noticed a really bright star. I saw it move and I thought it was a plane so I ignored it. I continued to look out the window unable to sleep when I realized I had been watching this darting object for atleast an hour. The bright star was moving in a zig zag pattern, but always staying in the same circular zone. I knew I was looking at a UFO but I wanted to be sure, so I would close one eye and watch the object and the behavior was the same. I then decided to try and photograph it as well as video record the object but the camera on my phone was not able to record at that distance. I have the videos that are black screens if they are of use some how. I spent roughly 2-3 hours watching this object. It never left the pane of glass it was watching it through but it moved all over the pane of glass. I didnt really have any emotions or feelings at the time. I lost site of the object when I fell asleep I guess. I cant recall how it ended."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-74.620808","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","Date Submitted":"09/11/2012 09:24 UTC","Log Number":"US-09112012-0023","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.449966,+-74.620808(42489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42489) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/10/2012 01:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"(GS) Bright round Star Moving in straight lines zig zagging but staying in the same relative location","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42489.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42489.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Montgomery","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Montgomery","Case Number":"42489","Latitude":"40.449966","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
