While waiting for the dog to do his thing I looked to the east over the neighboring apartment block and noticed six dots of light. The points of light were easy to see because I live in the city and the stars are not visible. The six points of light were arranged in a long pattern. The lights were white in color. A single point of light out front, two lights side by side fallowing that one and three side by side fallowing those. * * * * * * This formation was moving at a swift pace in a north westerly direction. The first light moved in a straight steady manner. The second set of lights seemed to flutter or vibrate. The third set of lights moved back and forth rapidly along the path of travel. None of the lights changed there their position in the formation only moving within their respective positions. I watched the formation move off to the northwest for around one to two minutes. At this point I lost sight of the lights as they passed behind my apartment. At first I thought they might be jets from Barksdale Air Force Base witch is to the east of me. However the way the last row of lights were oscillating so rapidly they could not have been aircraft navigation lights."],"Date Submitted":"04/15/2009 08:45 UTC","Longitude":"-93.745899","City":"Shreveport","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16520.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16520.html"],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Shreveport","There were no other sightings in Shreveport on or around April 15th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/15/2009 08:45 UTC","Summary":"Lights flying in formation."}
