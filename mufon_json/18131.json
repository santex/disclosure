object appeared sphereicle, white ball like with dark and light sides like a half moon. the time before this in april, about mid april 2009, same situation, i was with my children in the pool about 4:50 pm same object same brightness, same size same clear sky. i first noticed object out at almost same position in north sky at about 85% above horizon due north of my position where it remained fo about 30 minutes then started slowly wandering around in all directions until it remained on a heading se until it positioned itself due east of my position at about 70% above the horizon. stayed there for about 5 minutes then started slowly drifting sw until due sw of my position in the south western sky. then it stopped for about 10 minutes then headed back north\\north west to about due west of my position, where it remained as the sun set. same scenario, got brighter as the sun set behind horizon (no clouds in the west this time) totally clear. looked like a bright star until sunlight reflecting off of object turned redish and gradually dimmed as night set in until all reflection is totally gone! again lag time between setting sun and darkness untill light stopped reflecting off of object. again about 80,000-100,000 ft. high. rough guess but sphere may be about as big as small bus or large van, but white ball like! even small through standard binoculars. too small in sky to get photo, as it dimms with lag time to setting sun at about 8-10 minutes. then other time in october of 2008 same situation, but it remained at about straight overhead, enough to kink my neck trying to watch it until sun set. it didnt move much then at all and still had a lag time from setting sun untill all light stopped reflecting off of object. i am an ex-private pilot and never seen such erratic almost slow jerky back and forth undulations and movements, while it is in transit to new locations, which are really not noticible unless you stare at it. undulations like a giant round ballon on a string in a slight breeze. i only thought possibly it could be one of those high altitude blimps for the military surveilance, but i have seen them before in key west and they are lozenge shaped with three tail fins and do not go this high.i would have seen the tail fins through the binoculars! and the military blimps have red strobe lights after dark!!!!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.790599,+-80.221839(18131)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18131) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"01:27:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18131.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18131.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"07/16/2009 07:10 UTC","Case Number":"18131","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around July 16th 2009"]}
