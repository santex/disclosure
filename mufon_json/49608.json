An orb being trailed by two small lights were flying toward my friend and I from the North East seemingly slowly. The orb was emitting a strange white light that was arcing around it very slightly. The two trailing lights seemed to be getting closer to the orb when the light surrounding the orb grew exponentially surrounding the entire object, brighter than any light I have ever seen in the sky. As it's flight path turned South, it sped up, and the distance between the two trailing lights and the orb grew quite visibly. The large bright arc of light faded and the orb turned to fly back East where in the distance it grew large and bright one last time before blinking out of visibility. The two trailing lights followed in the same direction and finally blinked out a few seconds later. The entire sighting lasted about 2 or 3 minutes."],"Longitude":"-80.09606","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Country":"United States","Summary":"Orb trailed by two lights was emitting a small arc of light as it moved.
