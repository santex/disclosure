After dark we were sitting in the cabin in front of the fireplace talking when my brother Mike went outside to check on the dogs in the back. He was gone a long time. David went outside to see what happened to Mike and he did not come back. We were waiting on them to come back so we could go home, then Jimmy went outside to see were they went. Just a few minutes later Jimmy opened the patio door and said ���Hey Danny, come look at this outside!��� I walked outside and saw everyone looking off to the North across from us on the next ridge was this Huge round object. It was just above the tree tops and glowing and pulsating. It looked like it had heat coming off of it. After watching this object for along time, a jet plane flew over us from the South and flew North over the object. The plane just went on like it never saw the object. As the plane flew over the object, the object moved up in the air a little and stopped. It sat for a second or two then it started moving very very slowly towards us. As it got closer we could see the shape was Triangle shaped. This object ended up coming right in front of us above our heads and paused for awhile never making a sound. It was right above the tree tops, so close I could have hit it with a rock. It was Huge, about the size of a football field. We sat and watched it for what seemed like along time. We could see all underneath the object, it had big clear lights spaced out all underneath it. We could see all the metal work and designs underneath the object. While we were watching the object, To the East of us was a group of C130's crossing over the river. After the last plane past out of sight, the object went from a pause to shooting off at a high rate of speed to the South East towards Conway Arkansas in a matter of 2 to 3 seconds. And we could still see it as far as we could see way off and stopped and started blinking. When the object took off it did not make any noise what so ever. On the way home we did not say much about it. We were all stunned I guess. Over the years since I have told a few people about it, some believe it and some don���t believe it. But I will swear on my death bed, I am a Christian and know what the bible says about all liars going to hell, so before God knowing this....This is my statement."],"Summary":"Triangle shaped UFO, made no noise, size of a football field, stopped above our heads for along period of time, and 4 of us saw it.","Latitude":"35.148417","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Menifee","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6415.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6415.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/01/1985 08:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
