I was with three persons who also was witnesses. I was in my room , then one of the person starts to scream: Look at the star! It'���s get larger! It took ca 10 minutes from they thought it was a star until it was so near that we could se it was a craft. I and another witnesses came into the living room where the two other persons where sitting watching TV. Then the light enlarged and shifted direction, fall down from the heaven, and flied 500 m otside the house in front of three 'collective apartments' ( I dont know the english word ) with some 100 inhabitants in each other. I dont know if anyone there saw this. Then it shifted direction and came in front of our garden, stopped over a tree for 5 seconds. Then we could se some mass dripping from it and a blue light comming from downside the craft and spread around. At the same time the whole craft pulsated. Then it flied over the treetops, and immediately we could se that it had three or four landing pads and it swept trought the garden twelve m forward us and we could se it lighteden up the gras. It flew to the other side of the garden, over and disapeared in the night. The garden is large about 100x100 m. I think the plan was about to land, but since we was three persons, not sleeping they hesitate. The three eprson I was with was actually shocked. I was teh only person who went silent and just staring. I was not shocked at all.. It was what most people will call a very unusual encounter."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00"}
