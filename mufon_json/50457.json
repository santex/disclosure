I was laying in my bed, I woke up to find three figures above my bed about 3-4 feet tall, it was hard to tell what they looked like as when they were by me I was totally paralyzed, I managed to turn my head, they seemed to be reptilian looking in nature, I couldn't speak or move, they were touching and what felt like objects or their fingers, were going into my belly button and genitals, I was very afraid and was trying to yell but couldn't, I managed to yell for help and when I did that they seemed to turn invisible with some sort of cloak, but they were still there and touching me. I blacked out and woke up two more times with them standing next to my bed touching me or doing something physically to my body of these times I was unable to move or yell."],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-87.836185"}
