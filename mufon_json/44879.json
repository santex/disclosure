{"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent outside to walk. Saw noticably bright orange object moving in the sky, then followed by sequentual orbs following the same pattern in the sky. I thought UFO, immediately because it, then they, didn't look like anything I'd seen before. The most I saw at once were five, as each one reached a point in the sky it disappeared at that point, then the next one that reached that point disappeared, and so on. For six minutes new ones would appear on the northeast while others disappeared on the south east."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Log Number":"US-01012013-0006","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Lake Havasu City","There were no other sightings in Lake Havasu City on or around December 31st 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lake Havasu City","Date of the Event":"12/31/2012 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Arizona","Summary":"sequentual orange orbs elevating to 110 degrees moving from northeast to southeast and disappearing at 120 degrees, bright orange","Date Submitted":"01/01/2013 01:59 UTC","Case Number":"44879","Latitude":"34.468176","Longitude":"-114.307799","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.468176,+-114.307799(44879)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44879) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44879.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44879.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
