I was so terrified because it was the weirdest thing I had ever seen. I ran back into my house and got my son, then I felt even more weird because when he came out all the lights were gone all he could see were three flickering lights in the distance and he could here the sound dying away, it was as if all the lights were now turned off."],"Summary":"round sphere like object flying low over house in Hampton Georgia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.753955,+-84.386612(25959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25959) map </A>","Region":"Georgia","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/18/2010 04:23 UTC","Longitude":"-84.386612","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
