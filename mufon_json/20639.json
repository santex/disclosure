I am a co-worker with Shawn Morrison at the mine here in Ruth. We were working night shift and I run the dump, so where I am at it is very dark, one of the drivers pulled me over and told me what he had just seen, he was very excited about it. I told him I would keep my eye out. I guess an hour had passed by, and all of the sudden this orange like ball was there, it didn't go up or down or side to side, it sort of hovered there for a minute and then just disappeared, needless to say I was a little excited, called the truck driver on the radio and told him I had just seen it. I ended up seeing this same object about 3 different times that night. The only thing over that direction is a housing community known as the Gap and Ely State Prison. So needless to say it was a little exciting."],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"09/30/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20639.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20639.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11212009-0009","City":"Ruth","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"39.278272","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ruth","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
