(about 1.2 miles) we lost sight of the lights. the object was heading south. while driving from crestwood to tuckahoe, we were freaking out a bit after seeing it, and when we got to tuckahoe there were a few people on the street, and we had rolled down our windows to yell \"did anyone else see that?\" however no one seemed to have known what we were talking about. what really freaked us out about the object was that it was completely vertical the entire time, and we just knew that we had definitely never seen anything like it before."],"City":"Tuckahoe"}
