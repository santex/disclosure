It was a reddish light that changed slowly toward a bluish hue. It did not look like an airplane or helicopter. It flew below cloud level, crossed the St Mary's River into Ontario, Canada, and continued North-east. Its motion was steady but seemed to accelerate slightly then return to its original speed. As it passed, we noticed that the light either went out or had been projecting from the forward side only. When it was above us, we noticed that it was egg-shaped and dark in colour. There were no flashing lights and no sound. The body seemed to be striped, as if made of bands. It continued on under the clouds until it disappeared from sight. Several times as it receded, I lost sight of it. At its farthest visible distance, I could see it only with my peripheral vision. There was one other witness."],"Date of the Event":"07/22/2013 09:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/23/2013 09:09 UTC","Country":"Canada"}
