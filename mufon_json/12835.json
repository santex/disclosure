At approximately 3:40 EDT, I witnessed an aerial object at cloud height approach my line of sight from the SE heading NW. The object appeared to be a silvery-white color. The object was rather unusual because no wings could be detected, nor was there any sound associated. The object resembled a blimp in shape, cigar-shaped more or less and was moving at a steady speed. The object disappeared into one of the thicker cirrus clouds and did not reappear. Sighting lasted approximately 70 seconds."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.821642,+-85.293912(12835)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12835) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar"}
