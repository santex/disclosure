I looked up and pointed, then my 5 friends all saw the same thing. A bright light that looked like a star with a cone shaped light coming out from the star, looked as if it were coming down to earth. the star disapeared about 30 seconds after we saw it, the cone stayed but slowly disapeared. this all lasted maybe 2 or 3 minutes at the most! it was too quick for us to get a picture once we thought of it. it appeared as a foggy cloud but when it disapeared we realized there were no clouds in the sky at all. the light we saw was much higher then any airplane would travel. it was NOT and airplane. after wards we heard of 6 other people in our county who saw the same thing!"],"Latitude":"38.973725","Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 09:50 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09202009-0015","Tags":"City","Region":"Maryland","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 08:20 UTC","Case Number":"19475","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Greensboro","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.973725,+-75.804933(19475)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19475) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cone, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19475.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19475.html"],"Summary":"Small star-like light with a cone of light shooting out from underneath. \"Star\" dissapeared then the cone slowly dissapeared."}
