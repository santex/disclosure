I was located 3 miles south of South Havens main public beach. The object was at high altitude and appeared to be as bright as what Venus would be. After a few minutes it vanished. The sun had not set yet and I was surprised because at first I thought it was a planet, there were no clouds in the sky and you could see the blue in the sky because the sun had not yet set below the horizon. I scanned the area and located a second star like object 50% above the hozizon moving SW in the direction of where the 1st object had been. This vanished after reaching the area of the 1st objects location. 3rd object star like located 10% north of the other objects previous location moving NE after reaching about 50% above the horizon vanished.
