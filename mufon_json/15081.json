At first we thought they were stars but they were in FRONT of the clouds. Then we said they were planes but then a commercial airliner plane flew right thru the formation and they didn't move. We watched them as we journeyed to school and they would slowly disappear into the clouds and then return later to their original position. We watched then for about 40 minutes. During this time they would come and go... sometimes very bright and blinking. After dropping my daughter off to school I found a spot to watch them until they disappeared and then went home. Unfotunatley we didn't have a camera to take any pics. We thought we were dreaming at first. It was just weird."],"Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.926411","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01232009-0011","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-105.08466","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Broomfield","Summary":"3 starlike objects in the sky in FRONT of the clouds!","Case Number":"15081","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
