Immediately we observed a red-orange ball of light in sky moving slow but steady South to North. We watched it silently fly overhead. The light only appears at the front of the object and the back is unlit. Several more appeared on the same path and going the same speed. During these sightings an airplane appeared higher than the objects and you could hear it. During each appearance a bat would appear flying erratically...don't know if that matters but did not want to leave anything out."],"Longitude":"-95.36156"}
