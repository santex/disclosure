I was in the passenger seat. When around 10 pm, we both noticed a white grey orb like sphere, come over the left side of the top of trees, and heading toward our car, and down to over our roof as if it was going to crash into us. (kind of like if someone was throwing a snow ball at us from over a hill). My wife screamed to her mom saying \"What was that!\" while I was looking around to see if I could follow it. but the road was dark and trees on both sides, I dont know where it went or what it was. It came as close to the windshield to see it really good, almost hitting it."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Region":"New Hampshire","Case Number":"15560","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less"}
