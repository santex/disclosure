It sort of sounded like a blimp-with a wriling sound-not real loud but loud enough,i felt a vibration. At first I was wondering if this is what an earthquake felt like but then I thought-you can't hear an earth quake. By the time I got to my front door,I just stood there for about 5 minutes and listened, never saw anything but it sounded real close I looked behind me,briefly,but still didn't see anything. what worries me is,there a power plant visible from the end of the main drag. I then went in my house as I then kind of put 2&2 together as to what I thought I just witnessed. When I saw the article in our local newspaper this week,I thought I would pass out.
