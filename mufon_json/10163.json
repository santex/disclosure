It sounded like firecrackers as it passed by . It was liike it had an aura to it. I talked to people at school, and they said they heard it aswell, but only in certain areas. You couldn't tell where the sound was coming from, until you looked up. I saw the ship and it looked like a triangle. It was bigger and closer than normal airplanes. It's lights were flashing , and it was traveling slower than normal airplanes. Also the lights were much brighter, i rembemr a red and white ones. After one of them passed, yet another passed going in the same direction. Both made the huge staticky, firecracker, gunshot noises as they passed.
