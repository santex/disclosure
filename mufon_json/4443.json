There is always lots of air traffic almost every day. I carry my camera with me and take pictures when things look interesting to me in the sky. A week does not pass that I don't catch something anomalous in one or several of the photos. I am sending the untouched original and an enhanced photo. The camera was pointed in a NNE direction. The Atlantic Ocean is about one mile from where I took the photo. There were an unusual amount of chemtrails being laid when I took the photo."],"Region":"North Carolina"}
