[there has been recent news coverage of a 2 satellite collision last week (maybe around tuesday- wednesday). also there has been coverage of close range asteroids that were found last autumn, and several large objects that entered the atmosphere last october-november 2008. also, i saw one of these on 10\\31\\08 at 2:58 am and the color was yellow amber with a faster speed and longer visible duration which appeared to break into several pieces]. what i saw this morning was different than normal in speed and color from previous experiences with meteor phenomenon, and may be part of recent satellite activity. what i thought was most interesting was that it occurred in charlotte airspace, and could have been spotted on radar."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Kannapolis","There were no other sightings in Kannapolis on or around February 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02162009-0031","Country":"United States","Case Number":"15538","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
