I watched a little bit of coverage of this on Larry King on Youtube.com. Prompted by curiosity to find out more, I surfed the web to get some more information about his case. After I saw his drawings and accounts of the orbs, I thought it might be worth something to at least notify someone involved with his case of some occurrences that have happened within the last year, mostly the end of summer and fall 2007. They seem related to Stan���s sleep-walking episodes of a hypnotized state involving the writing of unknown equations. In August, my sister had similar hypnotic experiences where she did not remember what she had written. This occurred with progressive intensity during a five day (plus) episode where she did not sleep for many nights, eventually leading to her going to the hospital. During some of this, she did have recollection ��� but her logic and way of speaking was very strange, as if she was awake in a dream-state of mind. Throughout, there were many drawings involving planetary alignments and other ���codes��� and symbols with numbers corresponding to dates and letters. She spoke about shadows and orbs. I witnessed strange noises outside of her window one night. I was too scared to investigate further, as was she, and the two of us both ran out of the room. She drew things on her body, as well, which were still there when we took her to the hospital. One symbol bore resemblance to Stan���s. In addition to this strange experience, to which other events were related, I also have another friend who went through the same sleepless experience and ���figured out codes��� and described the episode with very similar language. If you have any information about this kind of ���code��� writing that might be of use to us (perhaps others who have experienced this too) we would appreciate your pointing us to something."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Log Number":"US-06012008-0008","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"10994","Longitude":"-75.923215","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/27/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Reading","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.340428","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10994.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10994.html"],"Summary":"orbs and code during hypnotic state"}
