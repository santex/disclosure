I saw at first what i thought was a airplane.But I was farmiliar to UFOlogy and didn`t see a exhaust trail.Which indicated It was now a Unidentified flying object.Then more came out, three, then two objects.There were there then five.I walked further into the yard and looked into the opening.I quickly got on my bike, and went up the road and followed them. I only saw them shortly because there was a giant cloud to the south.And they blended into the cloud.But I wouldn`t be able to see them anyways to the south because there was the forest. I assure you this really happened."],"Summary":"I was on my grandmothers`s swingset, and i saw a UFO."}
