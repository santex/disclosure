We come the same way every night. We noticed an amber reddish orange orb brightly lit flying towards us.It got progressively bigger because it was getting closer. We had pulled over and were had our eyes fixated on the object. It increased speed greatly for a brief moment and then kind of wobbled and slowed and then completely changed direction flying to the right of us. It then started to lose brightness and color intensity and then kind of disappeared into a small red dot and then it was gone completely. I am an avid UFO and ET believer which kind of helped me to recognize the basic characteristics of a UFO as I have read in other peoples experiences. It was the 1st time I have witnessed anything that I would bet money was a UFO. We went back up the road and around again and didnt see it again."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10252011-0018","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
