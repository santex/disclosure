I was very exicted about this and told my father to look because I had tried to get him to see one because I see them quite often he hurried out of his truck and looked up. He made no excuses for it and didn't even try to come up with a possible explanation of what it could be. I do believe that he believes in UFO'S now. Ever sense this he looks up a lot more!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/15/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32793.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32793.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.20703,+-91.822583(32793)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32793) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"32793","Region":"Arkansas","trends":[]}
