It was moving silently from the SW to the NE and it had no other lights on it as would be normal for jets. It did not blink as it moved slowly across the sky. I thought it could have been a satellite but it was much too bright. It was however trailed by a much dimmer object which did appear to be a satellite. They moved together about a hands width apart at arms length. I watched it until it dissappeared over the horizon. Total sighting lasted approx. 3 minutes."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"17916","City":"Charlestown","Log Number":"US-07072009-0022","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/06/2009 12:00 UTC"}
