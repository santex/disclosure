( i was facing west) all of my sightings occured at night and predominantly over the catalina channel, which was the main view from our house. as a side-note, i'd like to point out that my father, deceased, was a theroetical phyisist working on his em theory (of the universe) at that time and my mother told me that she had heard that same sound on many nights. as i lay in bed that night, shortly after these event, i witnessed my father come into my room (i slept in his den\\office at that time) in an appearent \"sleep-walk\" and write down equations on the large blackboad on which there were very intense\\high-order calculus equations relating to his ongoing work. later that morning on his \"awakened\" discovery of the additions to the equation, he was very irratated and demanded an explanation, he was completely unaware of his contribution while in the translike state. being a staunch non-believer in anything that would not pass his scientific proof criteria, he certainly would never entertain any suggestion of \"outside\"-interventive assistance a viable explanation. by the way, he had built a very large ground-plane antenna base just below our house which was used in various antenna designs, many for the u.s. navy submarine contracts(ulf). i tried unsucessfully to view several ufos through an 18\" astromonical telescope w\\low power eye piece. they were always \"just\" out of focus. i sometimes wonder if perhaps what i was viewing was somehow vasilating between dimensions..not quite \"in\", or \"out\". these sightings continued to occur over several years untill we eventually moved. i was always filled with a sense of frienship and beauty from these objects and never felt any fear or threats. i felt somehow almost a spiritual connection."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/20/1969 12:00 UTC"}
