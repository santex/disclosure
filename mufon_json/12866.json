At the same time we saw an airplane close by. The UFO speed was ruffly 4 to 5 times faster then the airplane. Our reaction to this was that I was sure that it must have been something else the UFO, but the speed of the craft was so much that it was not an airplane. 2 weeks after I got on-line to see if anyone else saw something similar in the Berlin area, and all the reports and videos were on the same thing.... ;) T"]}
