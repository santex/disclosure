The town is in the vicinity of Sea-Tac airport, so we saw plenty of commercial aircraft and single engine planes flying across our FOV. about ten minutes in, we all observed a fast moving object flying in a straight path above the treetops. The object was gone quickly, but i was able to note that it seemed to have a dark body (ovular or teardrop in shape), with dull yellow lights emanating from the front and sides as if they were lights from an illuminated interior (which gave me the feeling it was being piloted by a crew). The object was completely silent, and appeared to fly less than 300 feet above us. Though it was only in sight for a matter of seconds, we all responded in mild shock and surprise. One person suggested it could be a meteor, but given its appearance and lack of sound this seems unlikely."],"Object Features":"Window(s)","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25348.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25348.html"],"Summary":"Low flying, teardrop-shaped object with points of yellow light","Longitude":"-122.357065","Case Number":"25348","Object Shape":"Egg, Teardrop"}
