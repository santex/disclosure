(btw, there is an ancient belief that on this day within the 24 hr time frame , the heaven & earth are bridged together). i went outside, sat down & asked a specific question , asking for a sign if indeed the ets we see are indeed benevelent , yes even me does have doubts at times. i must point out 1st , that the weather was absolutely fantastic without any rain what so ever . at few seconds of intensely formulating this question in my mind , turned my head towards the es direction & my mouth 'dropped' in a gasp of amazement . there was in that spot i was looking at was forming a rainbow ! not only that , but a visible light white huge sphere-like above this rainbow as well ! (a mother shop perhaps ?!) i begun taking photos , smiling & thanking g-d for this manifestation. there also were cloud faces forming , could it be the lord's ?! in total i took 11 photographs , from 7:08:35 pm to 7:17:37 pm . only the last 2 photos didn't register anything unusual , but few jets flying . needless to say i was standing there in amazement :-) after coming inside & loading those photographs on the computer , i noticed more unusual things that the camera captured . too bad , we can only upload 3 attachments with the report . however if mufon wishes i can provide these via e-mail . as usual , i felt elated & happy at the sighting & afterwards . the whole appearance formed itself in the lower part of the horizon level where i was at , at approx. mid point of es direction & above the lake . the visible half moon was very high in the sky (like 3-4 times higher ) & way to the right as in the south direction , & exactly above the 14 floor apt. building ."],"Region":"Ontario","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.661156","Longitude":"-79.375224","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.661156,+-79.375224(23831)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23831) map </A>"}
