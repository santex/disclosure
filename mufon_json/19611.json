I thought they were clouds, but the clouds hept moving, these did not. So while driving I grabbed my Canon EOS 20d and shot some pictures, but noticed one was gone, the other never left and stayed there until I finally drove away from it, and it went behind some clouds. Attached are the pictures. Note these pictures are over a 15 minute period. There are many more pictures than these that are full resolution, these submitted pictures are resized for use on the internet. Never saw any movement, I was all by myself, and was driving and when safe would take pictures through my windows."],"Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
