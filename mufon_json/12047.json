{"Date of the Event":"08/03/2008 09:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Very bright light traveling across Sierra ridgeline silently and then vanishing before our eyes","Case Number":"12047","Date Submitted":"08/03/2008 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["sighting detailswife's account on monday august 3, 2008 at approximately 9:00 p.m. in tollhouse, california my husband, ed and i witnessed something in the sky that neither of us have been able to fully explain. our home sits at just below the 2000 ft elevation and our front yard faces towards true north. our home sits upon a rise putting our home higher than the other homes in our immediate area. most all of the houses in this area have about 5-10 acre lots. there is a home directly north and below our yard and then a country road that runs east-west that is even lower. once across that road there is a valley that i would estimate to be about 4 miles wide and 14 miles long. directly north of this valley is the first major mountain ridge that begins to make up the sierra mountains. there is a highway that cuts up the lower 1\\3 of this ridge that leads to shaver lake and beyond. this ridge rises from 2000 ft to about 4500 ft. there is a smaller ridge that juts out towards the southwest from the main ridgeline that is called razorback mountain. from our front yard we have very good visibility of all of the skyline above both of these ridges. on the evening mentioned ed and i were sitting at a table in our front yard enjoying the cool evening air when ed brought to my attention a very bright light that was moving around razorback���s ridge and starting to proceed east along the major ridgeline. at first i didn���t thing anything of what i was seeing except for wonder of what it could be due to its brightness and intensity of light. the light at first registered as a possible spotlight from a plane or helicopter but then i realized that there was not a beam coming out from the light source. as this object came around the first ridge and moved more easterly i was began to run through my mind what i���ve come to know over the 21 years we lived here of other objects we have seen in the sky. i looked for blinking lights, none - colored lights, none - change in appearance as the object changed its position in relation to use in the sky, none, change in intensity of the light, none - sound, none - shape, none other than a bright true white light with rays emiting from it. it reminded me of the bright halogen light that we have in our home. as this object traveled along it did not flicker or move up or down in elevation, it just seemed to float at a constant level. as mentioned earlier, it also moved silently. due to this i felt that it was moving slowly, ed on the other hand said that it seemed to be moving very quickly. a few moments after our first sight of the object ed got up from his seat and moved away from the table and positioned himself about 10 feet southeast of where i was sitting. he was still able to talk to me but had a slightly different point of view as he could see towards the east without any obstruction. i stayed seated at the table and continued to observe the object as it went behind some shrubbery. due to the brightness of the object i never really lost site of the object as it moved along. once the object got about 8 miles down the ridgeline it began to become smaller although it continued to retain its intensity of light, it went from its original size down to a pin-point and then gone in less than a minutes time. when the object vanished i said to myself out loud, ���oh my god, its gone���. ed immediately said to me, ���you saw that���? it was an immediate confirmation for him that i had seen exactly what he saw. after the incident was over we stayed outside for quit sometime to see whether there were any other appearances in the sky. as we sat there we started to discuss we saw, we tried to determine how high it might have been. we discussed the size of the object. we believe it was mars that was in the southeastern sky, the object appeared to be at least twice its size. i know from watching other objects in the sky it is very hard to determine size and how high they are. husband's account big, bright brilliant white ���light���, (object?) at least 3 times the size of mars in the sky. the white light was so bright it appeared to have light shafts emulating from it, not flickering or changing, they were constant shafts. i noticed a unusually bright light north and a little west moving south in my direction, coming around razorback mountain. i���m at about the 2,000 foot elevation. this light moved?���very slowly���but quickly and followed the ridgeline towards the east. as it followed the ridgeline, its path paralleled our valley in tollhouse, giving us a perfect view and several minutes to observe it. our view was, first, it coming towards us and slightly above, second, it turned giving us a ���side��� angle view and third, a rear quarter and rear view. i am saying front, side and rear only to describe our perspective, not the object seen. there was no object - not a helicopter, plane, air balloon, ultra light, hang glider, comet, star, falling star, bird, etc. it did not turn, it just began to move along a different line. the light was seen shortly after dusk. we have a great view and can easily see green and red navigational lights. our area also has natural acoustics. we can often hear planes and helicopters from many, many miles away. during the sighting we could see several plane lights and silhouettes in other areas of the sky. as the light approached us i pointed it out to my wife. i stood up and moved about 15 feet from her to a better spot, giving us slightly different angles of view. this light was silent, i tried to gauge speed, it seemed to just float on a level, soft, calm, tranquil line, but then i would lower my eyes to take in the ridgeline, it made it seem to be moving at a good rate. its path���s distance: coming towards us view - about 10 miles turning, arch about view - 5 miles across the ridgeline\\over the valley - 15 miles all through the sighting we are discussing the light, shape, size, perspective, height, speed, sound, other objects in the distance. as the light gets even with us the light���s intensity stays the same level in brilliance but the size begins to get smaller, slowly going down to a brilliant point of light and then���its gone���it vanished right in front of us. there was no tell tale signs, nothing, gone. there is just open sky where it was. after talking about the sighting was were able to determine the following: brilliant light with no visible shape constant non-flickering ray bursts shooting out from light silent running no navigational lights it did not turn in a flight maneuver, it just moved off on a different course the size of the light changed but not the intensity of the light what bothered me the most was we saw something, an object or light that went from something to nothing in a very good observational setting with no source left behind to account for the light in a clear twilight sky. both my wife and i are highly trained in observational skills and we have been in this home for over 20 years. from our observations we are sure what we did see but most importantly what we did not see nor hear."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Auberry","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Auberry","There were no other sightings in Auberry on or around August 3rd 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.030885,+-119.373339(12047)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12047) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.030885","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12047.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12047.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08132008-0004","Longitude":"-119.373339"}
