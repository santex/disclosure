{"divs":["sighting detailstonight (8\\3\\12) at approximately 9:50pm, my wife went outside to sit on our deck. after being outside for about a minute, she called for me to come outside quickly. i got up off the couch and ran to her. she pointed to a large black oval flying through the night sky from right to left above the tree line. she said that when she came outside, it was almost directly above our home. about 20 seconds later it was out of sight. we thought for a while what it could have been. we are not that far from the pittsburgh intl. airport (about 10 miles) and see a lot of planes every day\\night. however, every plane we see at night normally has red and white lights. this was completely unlit and black. it moved much quicker than anything else we've seen in the area too. furthermore, when we've seen planes that close before, we normally hear their engines. this object was completely silent. after talking for a while, my wife and i decided to contact this website. hopefully other people saw it too. we would like to know what it was because we can't explain it. it gives us chills just talking about it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.422684,+-80.080284(41405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41405) map </A>","Longitude":"-80.080284","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Carnegie","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Summary":"large black oval flying quickly and silently","Case Number":"41405","Date of the Event":"08/03/2012 09:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-08042012-0006","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Carnegie","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41405.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41405.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/04/2012 12:48 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"40.422684"}
