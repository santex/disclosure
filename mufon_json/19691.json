I assumed she saw them too so I pulled over behind her. We both got out of our cars but when we looked up they were gone. I mentioned it to a friend who thought we were crazy but later called me back to inform me that she had received a call from her sister in-law who reported seeing the same things. What I know for sure is at least three people saw them that night."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City","Region":"Oregon","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.806703,+-120.550361(19691)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19691) map </A>","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"19691","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"09/28/2009 01:36 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19691.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19691.html"],"Longitude":"-120.550361","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/26/2009 08:45 UTC","Summary":"5 orange orbs southern sky","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
