It caught my eye out of my office window because it was as black as anything I ever saw and was moving real slow due south, while the clouds were all moving due east. After about ten minutes of moving due south it turned and headed due east until I could no longer see it. It didn���������t make any weird moves or anything but the intense black hue and going across the prevailing wind made me think twice. I have no idea what it was but I took some pictures, none of which came out very clear. But when you zoom in on them there are weird colors and shapes.
