VERY FAINT HAD TO LOOK AWAY FROM IT TO SEE IT WITH PERIPHREAL VISION IT WAS SO HIGH UP. NO BLINKING LIGHTS. ABOUT 5 MIN. LATER SAW IT GO BACK FROM EAST TO WEST IN SAME LINE IT TRAVELED PREVIOUSLY FROM WEST TO EAST. DIDNT SEE IT FOR ABOUT 10 MORE MIN. THEN FOUND IT AGAIN GOING EAST TO WEST AGAIN BETWEEN THE SAME STARS. I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE & IT REALLY FREAKED ME OUT. I KNOW THIS WAS NOT A PLANE IT WAS SO FAR UP IN THE SKY. I COULD SEE THE STARS BRIGHTER THAN THIS OBJECT. I AM GOING TO BE WATCHING AGAIN TONIGHT. THIS THING WAS FAST & IT WAS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS FLYING IN A GRID LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. NO BLINKING LIGHTS AT ALL JUST A FAINT RED LIGHT. I FINALLY DONT HAVE TO BELEIVE SOMEONE ELSE IVE SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES!!!!"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Alabama","Date of the Event":"05/03/2009 08:51 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16791.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16791.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/03/2009 08:51 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Pell City","There were no other sightings in Pell City on or around May 3rd 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.593645,+-86.276369(16791)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16791) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.276369","Latitude":"33.593645","Country":"United States","City":"Pell City","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05042009-0007","Summary":"Red object from west to east & east to west back & forth.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Source":"MUFON"}
