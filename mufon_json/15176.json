I was told that there have been a slew of sightings of glowing discs in the Mat-Su Valley, seen by folks in Anchorage and Wasilla. The same sort of objects have been seen recently in Fairbanks and North Pole (in the interior). We had three pictures from the Newsminer's webcam (ufo sightings found on MUFON) of an old ufo caught on film. Many people said that the glowing discs look exactly as the glowing disc from the newsminer's photos look."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"61.582809","Summary":"Not Provided","Date Submitted":"01/23/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15176.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15176.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
