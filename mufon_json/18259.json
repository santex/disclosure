Many lights, green yellow red white, some oif which would go out occasionally. Did not move at all, was COMPLETELY stationary. Sat and watched it for about 10 minutes, was still there while we drove away. At first thought it was a plane, but was too low, and completely stationary, and no nearby major airports or military bases. Not helicopter, too big and was a clearly apparent triangular shape. Sorry, no photos, just reactionary audio on a mini-cassete."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.638682,+-77.568605(18259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18259) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Saw a triangular hovering stationary object with blinking lights","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:10:37","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18259.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18259.html"],"Log Number":"US-07232009-0016","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Burnham","Case Number":"18259","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
