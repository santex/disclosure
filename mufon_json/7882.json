It disapeared in 30 to 45 seconds. The 90 degree point was the leading edge in movement. 1) We were all just out side the back door of our house not far from Monroe Ave and 1st Street. Bob and Jay were chating about the night scopes I was looking up to the South east at stars and listening to them. 2) Jay said look at that. I had to turn around to see it and dim lights on it were in a triangle shape. 3) I think maybe it was the flying wing but it was to fast in my opinion to be that, and again no sound from it. 4) It was heading a few degrees south of east and it moved fast. 5) Surprised nothing more. 6) It disapeared behind trees.
