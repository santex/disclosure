as a consequence there's a lot to tell. just after half past nine in the evening of october 6th, i was walking my dogs as usual. the sky had been exceptionally clear compared to previous weeks, allowing me to spot a satellite passing overhead at relatively great speeds with the naked eye just prior to the actual incident. about two minutes later, with me walking across a narrow, non-illuminated trail leading up to some exercise fields as well as dense forests + additional trails, i stood in awe when witnessing a bunch of tiny, bright objects gently moving along the tree line right in front of me (well, a bit to the left, that is). from my recollection, these little circles were red in color, although i cant tell from the pictures ive taken (in which they turn up blue\\whiteish). a slight pulsating of light seemed to be occurring, although not as distinct and wide apart as youd expect from, say, civilian aircraft. the most amazing thing was the fact that the individual objects seemed to be part of some sort of formation - they were moving as a whole, although every now and then, one of the objects would speed up and 'fall out of line' (towards either direction), so to speak. all in all, i was able to count at least 4 objects within said formation - its likely that there were 7 or more. i have to add to this that the tree line (used as a point of reference) was no more than a 100 yards from my person, with the actual objects seemingly much further away (at least a few miles, i reckon) - so perhaps ive missed out on a few additional ones. either way, having seen the formerly-mentioned satellite pass by just yet and being all-too familiar with the brute power of overflying f16s and a10s (my house is pretty much located underneath a military flight path), i was pretty clueless as to what was happening before my own eyes. seeing as how i live in a forested area with lots of natural beauty present there, i never leave the house without my digicam - the evening of october 6th was no exception to the rule. however, with darkness gradually kicking in earlier every day (compared to reasonably-clear summer evenings), and my photo-taking skills limited to simple broad-daylight\\macro shots kind of stuff, i had no idea what to do with my camera other than to switch between various modes and just 'snap away'. at first i felt very nervous about missing out on the experience altogether, seeing as how long it took to switch between the various camera modes with nothing other than the on screen display to assist me. however, much to my surprise, the event would go on to last another 3 minutes or so. whilst shooting pictures (15 or so in total, half of which ive deleted instantly), i tried to somehow get a decent light source near the vicinity of the objects - again, i had virtually no point of reference other than the tree line and lamp posts. my digicams built-in lcd wasnt helping at all, leaving me to act on gut feeling rather than anything else (not a good thing, that is). pointing at the thingies in the sky with a flashlight didnt turn out to be genuinely useful either. in order to improve the situation a bit, i proceeded to walk closer so as to look past the actual tree line (then partially blocking my view). in the process of doing so, i felt a bit distracted by a small gathering of partygoers to the right of me (another 200 yards away from me), forcing me to focus attention on my dogs and getting them their leashes on. after noticing said people, it just struck me how quiet everything had been beforehand. just the motorway's humming of passing vehicles, 400 yards or so in the distance - no roaring of jet engines as can be experienced when the f16s and a10s are up to their business as usual (every two weeks or so, can be heard from miles away, especially in such clear conditions). besides the tranquillity, another fact that conflicts with the 'military craft' (or civilian airliners for that matter) option is the fact that these objects seemed to be hovering 10 miles or so away, which would put them very near (if not across) the belgian-dutch border - not a typical place for 4 or more belgian (or dutch for that matter) fighter jets to pull off all kinds of weird stunts. plus, military jets tend to not randomly disappear en masse either, unless i've missed out on lockheed���s latest production cycle. in all fairness, the actual airbase is located pretty close to said border, but its fighters never venture northbound (towards the border) - rather, they will usually end up going south (inland) and then east (towards my place) before returning to base. it wasnt until having walked up to the well-lit cross section of this areas various trails, that i lost track of the formation of objects entirely. i've tried to look out for it in the following 10 minutes or so, but to no avail. all the while i was still very much in a state of curiousity-meets-nervosity, trying to make sense of what had just happened. i was assuring myself that others (within a radius of at least a few miles) surely must have witnessed the same phenomenon, as it occurred on a saturday night, during (or just prior to) 'going out' time. all the way back, i couldn't help but looking over my shoulder, yet nothing popped up anymore other than noisy civilian aircraft. after returning home, it turned out that most of the pictures contained nothing more than utter darkness and a few faint lights (from the lamp posts bordering the forest zone). luckily enough, after a few iterations of enhancing two particular pictures i was able to at least extract some evidence of the formation having been there in the first place. naturally, i've kept the original pictures to provide as evidence should anyone really care. the \"evidence\" i'm providing through these pictures is a little rough around the edges, to say the least - i personally have always hated vague material like this, but given the circumstances i'm hoping for you to bear with me. in between, i managed to shoot two movies as well - unfortunately, these show the typical 'jerky movement' kind of pictures of a few lights doing nothing in particular. again, i've enhanced this material a bit yet the results are quite appalling still. if anyone's interested i could still provide the enhanced and\\or the original video footage, though. to conclude all of this, i will add that i've always taken a liking to looking at the skies above, yet remain extremely skeptic of anything related to extraterrestials and whatnot. i've seen my fair share of weird stuff up there, yet was mostly able to track down the meaning of it all afterwards. in this particular case, however, i stand empty-handed and have to ask for possible additional witnesses to come forward. maybe these are thai floating lampoons (quite a fad as of late)? perhaps, but they're illegal here due to forest fire hazards - plus it wouldn't account for the rather sudden position changes at times. feel free to fill me in if you can."],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8094.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8094_submitter_file1__IMG_3749_lines2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8094_submitter_file2__IMG_3750_lines2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8094_submitter_file3__IMG_3750_unmarked.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8094.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/06/2007 08:40 UTC","Region":"Flemish Region","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Diamond, Square, Rectagular, Other","Country":"Belgium","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Maaseik","There were no other sightings in Maaseik on or around October 6th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Maaseik","Longitude":"5.783762","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"BE-10082007-0005","Summary":"Formation of several bright, slow-moving objects relatively gently rolling westwards before disappearing altogether","Case Number":"8094"}
