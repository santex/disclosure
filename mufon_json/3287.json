The time of the event was somewhere between 11am and 1pm, respectfully. As I drove up the Watterson Expressway on-ramp located next to the Mall St. Matthews heading towards the interchange with Interstate 64 (westerly direction), I noticed a small black object in sky over Interstate 64 from that distance (at least 3-4 football fields away). At first I thought it was one of those ballons car dealerships hang above their lots to get your attention. As I went under I64 I became afraid when I saw that the object was a perfectly circular and flat. Black on the bottom and reflective metal-like surface on the top. It stayed in the same position for quit sometime. I pulled off the shoulder and watched it for at least another 5 minutes before it went out of view. I called the police and local tv stations, but no one reported anything to anyone as far as I can tell. I am considering checking with the local airport to see if they recorded anything unknown on their radar."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/15/2005 06:09 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.262235,+-85.749966(3287)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3287) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/15/2005 06:09 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.262235","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Louisville","There were no other sightings in Louisville on or around March 15th 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3287.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3287.html"],"City":"Louisville","Case Number":"3287","Region":"Kentucky","Summary":"Not Provided","Source":"MUFON"}
