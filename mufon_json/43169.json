I have seen this same lights before, last summer, the light are not from any spot lights, nor aircraft in the area, nor are they from any drone planes, which have stationed themselves out in this are during the G8 summits. I am located near Toronto International airport, these lighs only happened now twice. it seems to emit from something above the clouds, shoots out then they, lots of lights, circle around. NO sound smell or anything. I have given alot ot theory on this, but nothing adds up, even thought of plane stacking positions of reflections, not so. I really wnat to know what these lights are and where they are coming from. this seemed to be the only way I could put out what I was seeing. My other half also seen them but chooses not to be concerned. I notice everything. I have seen the drone planes sitting in the sky, it took a few nights to convince my partner that they were not stars, esspecially when they can just take off in an instant."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Mississauga","There were no other sightings in Mississauga on or around October 11th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"10/11/2012 08:13 UTC","Longitude":"-79.697888","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
