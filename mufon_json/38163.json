Ive been intrigued with looking up and catching the moving stars. on May 10,2012 Around 8:40pm I was outside facing east when i noticed a star moving south (T.J,Mexico direction) towards the North as it passed in front of my View it Dropped rapidly(what looked like 2 inches) and became 4 to 5 times the size of a basic star and grew very bright, like a truck light. as it was moving towards me I felt the need to look at it all the way through. until all the hairs on my body lifted then it ascended and continued north..It almost looked like it never left just stayed farther. Then I ran in to the house and told my sister and 2 kids what i had seen. (I have last years Video which was Identical to this one. just opposite direction but on Video!)"],"Log Number":"US-05152012-0014","Longitude":"-119.410952","Latitude":"36.786631","Case Number":"38163","Summary":"south to north path until reached in front of me and decended towards with a bright light for about 2 sec, lights when of and went right back up and away..","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":[],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38163.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38163.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"05/10/2012 08:40 UTC"}
