Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Kingston","divs":["sighting detailsi live in the vicinity of woodstock, new york and have a mostly clear line of sight from the north north-east towards the berkshires in the north-east, all the way to the south-west, inclusive of mohonk mountain preserve, where the lights of the mohonk mountain house are clearly visible most nights, with parts of tivoli, annandale-on-hudson, kingston, rhinecliff, rhinebeck, and saugerties clearly visible by day and night. so in principle much of what i describe could have been observed from those locations. for skygazing this is an exceptionally busy place, on the side of the catskill escarpment, directly beneath the main approaches for military and commercial aircraft to stewart int'l airport, 30 miles to the south behind mohonk. i can also observe aircraft ascending from descending towards albany intl. airport, have on occasion observed air traffic associated with regional airports in kingston, rhinebeck and red hook. at higher altitude there are regular flights (but especially between 5-8:00am, and 4-9:00pm) headed north and south, presumably to and from saratoga, plattsburg, montreal, and the ny metropolitan airports. those lanes follow the hudson river closely. still higher-altitude lanes from points further south are superimposed on the same lanes that serve stewart int'l. there are high-altitude lanes, and regular flights to be observed around dusk, headed west from massachussetts, and east towards massachussetts. smaller craft bound for the regional airports here and beyond tend to fly on the intermediate points of the compass. and then there are the anomalous craft -- those also fly from every which direction, usually at intermediate altitude and between dusk and dawn. my point is, i observe aircraft frequently, and have done so (with increasing interest) for 12 years from this location. on 9\\11 i stood outside and listened perplexedly to a full-throttle jetliner race south over the hudson river, 10 miles to the east, invisible behind morning fog. i can hear amtrack on the dutchess county side of the river, and freight trains daily through saugerties and kingston, etc. in other words know what \"loud\", \"moderate\" and \"silent\" aircraft and automotive engines sound like. anything out of the ordinary is sure to capture my attention here where distant sounds and sights are easily perceived, weather permitting. in brief, tonight was a full moon so in addition to what seemed an exceptionally busy time for air traffic around 9:00 pm to 10:30 pm, it wasthe first time i could actually see the outlines of some of the craft i observed with 7x,50 field glasses. i am accustomed to two sorts of (slightly anomalous) craft, visible almost daily: hovering lights around rush hour (presumably helicopters monitoring the ny state thruway traffic), and large silent craft (sometimes visible by day, often with bright headlights which obscure their shape until they approach close by)--which large craft often turn out to be helicopters, of the sleek turbine-propelled variety. these make almost no sound, if any, except for occcasional slight jet engine noise. i observed at least one of these this evening. additionally, due to the moonlight conditions, i can confirm sighting of two triangular-shaped craft. the first of these, visible around 9:30 pm, shone bright headlights in front, two white flashing lights from behind, one or more flashing red lights at wingtip, and no less than four large (and i mean large, maybe 4' in diameter), round, non-flashing lights visible underneath, two white, one red and one green. this lighting arrangement i have seen perhaps a dozen times before, but due to the darkness could not verify the shape of the craft until this evening. the craft in question flew out of the northwest above overlook mountain and headed southeast towards kingston. no less than seven other aircraft were visible in the air at the time, at various distances and altitudes, and at least two of them -- bright yellowish spots of light, similar in appearance to the \"helicopters\" i regularly observe above the thruway, except this time one was approximately above woodstock town, the other approximately above the intersection of 212 and county rte. 30 -- turned and headed in the same direction as the triangular craft when it appeared. the triangular craft was flying at approximately 2500-3000 feet, or 1500-2000 feet above my location, at 200mph+. (in other words, noticeably faster than a cessna 172, with which i am familiar as a passenger as well as ground observer). at about this time (9:30) i observed flying west to east towards kingston what loooked to be a triangular craft, flying at 250mph+, marked only by flashing red lights as well as non-flashing red underlighting. i could not be sure of the details as it was several miles to the south. later, around midnight, i saw a brilliang yellow light approaching slowly northward from the direction of stewart int'l. i observed the light until its proximity caused it to fade, at which point i could see only a dim outline, two red flashing lights (similar to the craft just mentioned), with dim red lighting visible underneath the craft. as it continued northward, it passed slightly to the east of my location, perhaps 2000-3000 feet above (eg 5000' total, or less), and approximately 1\\2 - 1 mile to the east. so it was clearly visible through binoculars, and in the moonlight, as a flat, dark gray or black triangular craft. it appeared to pick up speed as it passed by, accelerating to 250mph approximately, making no sound whatsoever. with the exception of the first triangular craft, which made a slight jet-turbine sound as it passed overhead, none of the craft thus far mentioned made any audible sound -- all the more notable for the fact that while i was observing first-mentioned craft at 9:30pm there was other, more easily identifiable traffic in the air including one or two single-engine prop planes, which were audible at a similar or greater distance, even while the first-mentioned triangular craft flew directly overhead at a higher rate of speed, yet silently. finally, two separate sightings associated with visible aircraft (i.e., in the distance, as bright yellow headlights and\\or flashing beacons), but not identifiable as aircraft: around 9:30pm, observing a bright yellow light hovering and gradually approaching from the direction of mohonk, i suddenly noticed a very bright, greenish-white light headed towards me from the same direction (due south) just a bit above eye level, and seeming to move very quickly to my vicinity. within two minutes the light was passing by my observation point, moving slightly irregularly, the east and just a little above (i.e. at about 30 degrees of incline). when i jumped up from my chair to get a better look with binoculars, it seemed to slow down and change course. it drifted by slowly moving with slight irregularlities of speed and direction, and appeared to be very close, perhaps even as close as 50 feet (which would have made it a very small object, the size of a baseball), but it was difficult to judge size and distance because the object was brilliant though (seemingly, even through binoculars) small, and almost featureless. after i observed it for another minute or so (and rapped on the window to alert my wife, as a witness, from the kitchen), the object turned towards the northeast. as soon as it did so, appeared to gain altitude quickly and dimmed from view altogether within thirty seconds. a nearly identical object appeared directly overhead, same shape and color, around 12:00 midnight, within two minutes of the appearance of the second triangular craft described above. perhaps because the object was directly overhead (not to the east, in front of the moon, as was the first greenish-white sphere), it was possible to observe atmospheric effects around the object as it passed over my house (in an arc, from the south east towards the north north-east) which made the object appear to be relatively distant, perhaps 1000 feet above, perhaps as high as 5000 feet -- but like the other sphere, this sphere appeared to slow down when i jumped up from my chair, in order to keep it in view of my binoculars. this (apparent) reaction to my movement made both spheres very hard to judge as far as distance, speed and size were concerned -- by the same token, they gave every impression of being intelligently controlled, whatever they were. while i have viewed numerous unidentifiable or strange-looking aircraft from my location in the last six months, at this point none of this is particularly alarming to me personally, much less so to my wife (who could care less what these lights are). however i note that my three cats and dog were noticeably anxious this evening, even though i cannot say whether they actually observed the celestial phenomena themselves. also i have a young child at home who has commented recently on \"flashing lights outside\" at night -- though i don't know how he could have observed the same craft as i, since he is invariably asleep when i skygaze. evidently there is something strange, and perhaps not altogether \"material\" in the usual sense going on with all this... it may sound odd but one way i am able to anticipate an approaching (anomalous) craft when i am outside, is that the wind almost always picks up before one appears, and sometimes, the wind blows warmer than the ambient temperature on such occasions. if we're dealing advanced propusion technology, perhaps that would be a side effect, or an indication of focused radar ground scanning (i.e., night vision infrared beams?) it may sound strange but i have observed this effect so many times in the last several months that i am quite certain it is no mere coincidence, and not just imagination."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Kingston","There was one other sighting in Kingston on or around April 29th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
