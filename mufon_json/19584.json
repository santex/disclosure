I looked out the window and saw a shootong star. I was just dazing off into space. But I kept on staring at it and then I realized it wasn't a star. It was going really fast NE at probably 300 mph. AT LEAST! So I kept on looking at it and it was standing still after it was traveling at a fast pace. Iwas really scared and I didn't tell anybody because I thought everyone would think I was crazy. Now I know that a airplain cannot stay in one spot. So I know what I saw! I have a picture if you want me to mail it to you. Just mail me and say either you do or you don't."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Frankton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.222818","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"19584","Sighting Duration":"00:13:44","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","City":"Frankton","Summary":"Loud boom, very clear picture"}
