I guess to keep from colliding with other aircraft...you could just barely see the lights the naked eye...they would come and go...that is how I could see where the next flare or flares would appear...The flares would only last 3 seconds at longest...high altitude and many miles from Abilene...guessing the start of the hill country or so. Odd that I could not pick up the red lights on the planes at all...just the bright white strobe light that would appear at different times...I followed one of the planes that did have lights on breifly and saw the object drop the flares...These are the same lights that I have previously seen."],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-99.899813","Case Number":"23140","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
