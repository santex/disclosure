{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAs my husband was driving down the street, I(passenger seat) took a random picture with my new camera. I'm learning the manual settings so I am always practicing. I rolled down the window and snapped at nothing in particular. I checked my lighting and focusing in the camera and saw this white object. I quickly scanned the sky where I had just shot and there was nothing there except one wispy faint cloud. I took another picture about a minute later in case something was stuck on the lens. It was clear. My son thinks it is a refractory something having to do with the camera. My sister wanted me to send this in, even though I am quite skeptical of all UFO stories."],"City":"Mesa","Date Submitted":"04/14/2011 06:51 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28677_submitter_file1___MG_9002.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28677.html"],"Latitude":"33.416614","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-04142011-0014","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There was one other sighting in Mesa on or around April 10th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"showed up on a picture I took","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"04/10/2011 02:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.416614,+-111.828112(28677)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28677) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"28677","Region":"Arizona","Longitude":"-111.828112"}
