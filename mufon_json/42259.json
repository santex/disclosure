He was worried he was seeing things, but another employee and myself walked outside to see three glowing red objects in the sky. Two were closer together, but stationary, while the third was off to the side and stationary. over the course of two minutes the two that were close got closer to each other, it looked to me like the one stayed still while the other moved in but that could have been misinterpreted. The third, while the two were moving towards one another, moved father to the right of the other two orbs and then seemed to move into the distance, I am judging only by intensity of the light and that it seemed to move beyond the slight cloud cover. Once the other two seemed to \"meet up' they also moved away. Lights were brighter and larger than air craft lights, and each was a single pulsating light, while aircraft tend to have several on their undersides that stay lit. They also seemed a lot brighter, especially given the light cloud cover and the fact that stars tend to be harder to see in Waynesburg because of the lights being on. Very exciting stuff! They appeared to be southward."],"Latitude":"39.905914","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Waynesburg","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-09032012-0006","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Waynesburg","There were no other sightings in Waynesburg on or around September 2nd 2012"],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"42259","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.905914,+-80.17786(42259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42259) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
