It was translucent except for a glowing outline of a triangle in white light. It had three or four strange fins on the back like sharp knives. sticking straight out but very jagged. Not like aircraft wings. It was completely silent as it flew right over my head. I froze thinking again and saying to myself out loud THEY ARE HERE!! THEY ARE HERE! I could not get my camera in time."],"Summary":"Translucent Triangle Ship near LAX with Glowing light edges Headed over the Ocean under a plane,","Longitude":"-118.424346","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31931.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31931.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/09/2011 04:45 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.963824,+-118.424346(31931)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31931) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/19/2011 03:45 UTC","City":"Los Angeles","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"31931","Log Number":"US-09192011-0030","Object Features":"Wings"}
