When I looked at the photo I noticed these facelike shapes flowing down from the sky. I was amazed at what I was seeing!! I did not hear anything or see anything unusual when I took the picture, just a plain sky shot and not one I would normally be inspired to photograph. I was simply\"told\" to shoot here so I did. now I know why. The first shot is the original,second one is enlarged and enhanced to define the faces."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"Delaware","Longitude":"-75.544537","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/29/2009 07:51 UTC","City":"Wilmington","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"16619","Date of the Event":"03/29/2009 07:51 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16619.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16619.html"],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Wilmington","There were no other sightings in Wilmington on or around March 29th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
