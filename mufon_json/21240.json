At around 10:00am I gazed out my living room window - looking west, scanning the horizon as I frequently do, since there is alot of industry with smoke stacks that I informally monitor for excessive pollution. I saw that there wasn't too much to be concerned about that morning, however, I noticed a very small \"cloud\" which stood out, not far above the horizon. I watched this for a while as it moved slowly to the right (southwest). I picked up a small, cheap set of binocluars to get a better look (as my eyesight is not the greatest for distances).What struck me was that it did not dissipate or change like most small clouds do. Will continue later...there is much more to report.."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Windsor","There were no other sightings in Windsor on or around December 26th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"12/29/2009 10:38 UTC","Region":"Ontario","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.987555","Summary":"1st impression: small cloud, by itself, moving slowly above/along horizon, not dissipating; 5 minutes later, same shape, changed direction","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21240.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21240.html"]}
