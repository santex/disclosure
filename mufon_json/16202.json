A Navy base and a regional airport are located near my home. Airline and Helicopter traffic at night is common in the eastern pensacola sky. At approx 8:30pm A \"spiral\", for lack of better term, of lights began glowing a very bright red-orange in the east sky. This was not a helicopter or plane. It would glow for approx 1 - 4 sec then fade out from tail to the center of the \"spiral\". I called into the house for my wife to come out and see, which she did. The event lasted for approx 3 mins. with 10 - 30 secs in between appearances of the \"spiral\" in different configurations and also bouncing left and right in the sky from one appearance to another."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.425689,+-87.212145(16202)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16202) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"03/23/2009 08:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
