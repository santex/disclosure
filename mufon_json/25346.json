I looked up at the stars, since it's been a while, and I wanted to see what constellations I could recognize. Turning around, I see this VERY bright light staying stationary in the sky, ESE from Levittown, PA where I am. It's like 4 or 5 Venus's in one, when it's close to the earth. 20 minutes I check again and it's still there. My brother's already asleep or I'd get his telescope. There is no sound or movement that I can tell, since the pine tree branches are waving about. Planes with their lights have passed near it, so it's not a plane. I never saw anything like it. Now it's 20 minutes later and it's STILL there. I do believe we're not alone in the universe, and naturally, I very curious about this."]}
