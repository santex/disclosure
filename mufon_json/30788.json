I first noticed what appeared to be a satellite to my West, however it was moving pretty fast. Then around 5 minutes later, I was looking north east and I see this object just rising from behind the woods. It's huge like a star and at first I thought that it was a helicopter. However, knowing that there are a few houses behind this woods and further down is a church and then a farm.. this could not be a helicopter. I tried to get my video camera ready to focus, however since I was in my screened-porch it was not showing up great. So I went outside and tried to set up my tri-pod and it rose so fast that it was already above me. (Accelerated so fast) and no other lights from it. Then it started moving faster East and leaving my area. I ran out front of the house to see if I could catch it, but it was gone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.581302,+-78.619257(30788)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30788) map </A>","Longitude":"-78.619257","Latitude":"35.581302","Case Number":"30788","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Country":"United States","Region":"North Carolina","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08102011-0009","City":"Garner","Date Submitted":"08/10/2011 06:43 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30788.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
