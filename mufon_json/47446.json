I looked up at the moon and noticed what seemed to a VERY large star very close to it. The star then seemed to slowly move 45 degrees to the side of the moon and stop. It then slowly moved another 45 degrees to the bottom then stop. within a few seconds of the last stop I noticed a contrail that seemed low to the ground, going from south to north. I then looked back up at the shape and watched it do exactly the same thing in reverse. This happened right after the meteor blew up over russia, so I kind of thought it might be military. I have pictures that you can have, They are from my digital camera but may help. P.S. If you know what this was please let me know. I have pretty much tried to forget it, but have watched your show since and may'be I'm not crazy."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47446.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47446.html"]}
