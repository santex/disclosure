It was so loud I thought our house was going to be struck by an aircraft. I heard them coming back and went outside to see what their doing. When I looked to to see the jets, I noticed a black spec hovering in one spot of the sky about a mile away. two military jets were on their flight path in line to collide with the object. They flew directly through where the black spec was, and it vanished. I didn't see anything go any directions other then the two military jets never returning. My neighbor down the street said he saw the jets encircling the area and he too had heard a weird missile launching-like sound."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/13/2012 01:15 UTC","Summary":"Stationary Black spec hovering above Eugene","Region":"Oregon","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
