Its been in the same direction for second group of times for the second stright year. Dogs bark with hair standing on their backs. The light in the sky star like birghter then stars. Moves around quickly all directions. I have a couple of trees that it appears behind and can see the movements compaired to the trees. Seams to be .5 to 1 mile on the harison. This time was a little diffrent. Two glimering lights (eye like) close to the grond. They moved acrossed the yard. Called my wife out to see and get flash light. Wanted to make sure not some kind of animal. Turned flash light on the eyes and could see nothing. Turn light off and they were there again. They moved to the back of property and went stright up and gone. 3 min later the light that I have seen so many times moved down below tree level and the up an gone. This light looks like a brite star but moves so free. Up down left right close and far. Not a plan or hele. Makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck also."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22596.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22596.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.363078,+-89.390348(22596)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22596) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/31/2010 09:26 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":[],"Case Number":"22596","Summary":"Light moves all directions zippy like.
