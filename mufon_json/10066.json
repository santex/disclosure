North of Laredo, Texas. I saw four or five lights, North North East of me, that would blink. They would blink three or four times, Sometimes just one would blink and other times two or three at a time. They were moving around as well but not in a straight line. Just randum movement. If they had blinked stedily I would have thought they were planes but they only blinked on for a few seconds then nothing. I tried to think of what could behave like that but came up with nothing. Lights in the sky that blinked. Oh Wow. I wasn't going to even consider saying anything but after what was happening in Stephonville, I figured maybe this would add to someone elses sighting. They were high and far away, Maybe over the Artesia Wells, Texas area.??"],"Date of the Event":"03/26/2008 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-99.500112"}
