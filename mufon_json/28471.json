(again, very strange, because you can hear every plane that travels overhead here.) i asked *(name deleted--cms\\sg) if she knew what that was, and she said no...i was overly excited, because having seen things before, i have never seen one this close...we lost sight of it as it very quickly disappeared out of our view. i could not tell what kind of craft it was, and i tried to see it better with the lightning, but to no avail. it just appeared to be a very large spherical white light."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Summary":"Holiday","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.733825","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Holiday","Log Number":"US-03302011-0012","Date of the Event":"03/30/2011 08:40 UTC"}
