The light did not blink or wink, but remained constant and bright. From my standpoint I would estimate the light to be at about cruising altitude if an airplane, 60,000 ft or so. I moved to watch the light as it moved overhead, and as I looked up, the light dimmed and then faded completely, as if the light were only on one side of the object. I sat down, still looking up and out over the horizon. Looking out I briefly saw a distant white light moving north to south and then vanishing mid-flight. The first sighting lasted about 14-16 seconds, and the second object was in view for only 2 seconds or so. Night was clear. No sound. First object was very bright."],"Case Number":"39670","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06212012-0006","Region":"New York","Date Submitted":"06/21/2012 12:49 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.780197,+-73.666279(39670)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39670) map </A>","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Troy","There were no other sightings in Troy on or around June 20th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"sighted a solid, steadily moving white orb, altitude of approx 30,000 ft, moving east, over my location.
