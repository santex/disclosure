This ufo has been in the east-northeast sky hovering periodically, for months. Sometimes, there are several others. I had walked out onto my back patio and looked east because I have become accustomed to seeing this ufo there. It was hovering as usual, at about the height a jetliner would fly, as it usually is. After a few seconds, it appeared to drop 2 objects separately. They appeared to be \"falling\", but were going too slow to be in free fall. They appeared to have flames or fire coming out of the bottom of them. I was unable to see if they actually hit the earth because my wall around my backyard is taller than me. I think there were others in my neighborhood who saw this too. I was awestruck. I've NEVER witnessed anything so clearly, so unmistakably. I want to know what in heaven's name is going on in the desert in Arizona. Unfortunately, I do not have photos or video."],"Log Number":"US-01092011-0003","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27323.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27323.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Phoenix","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/08/2011 08:00 UTC"}
