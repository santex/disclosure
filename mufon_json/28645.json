I was looking at the Sirius star shining very brightly below the half moon suddenly a large light similar in size to the sirius star slowly faded in between the sirius star and the moon. At first I had thought that it was a star coming into view but the object became brighter and larger untill it was as bright and as large as the sirius star, after watching it slowly fade into view it shined as brigthly as the sirius star for about 15 seconds and it slowy faded out, it seemed to either cloak it self or leave the atmosphere. The whole sighting lasted only about 20-30 seconds. It was a Calming beautiful sight to see and I hope I will see it again soon."],"City":"Salem","Latitude":"44.952088","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28645.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
