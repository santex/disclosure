{"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"10/21/2010 08:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving West on 23rd Street just a few blocks East of Sterling in Independence, when a light caught my eye just to the North of me. It was a very large elongated fireball with no defined edges, and was traveling from South to North. The object was moving very slowly, and appeared to be about 200 feet up and two blocks away from my position. I pulled over to the side of the road to observe it, but did not follow it because I was a little bit afraid of what it might be. I didn't have my camera with me. The color was dark orange in the front part, and lighter orange in the back. It was the size of two thumbnails put together. I watched until it went out of sight, which took about 10 minutes. I've never seen anything like this and am still quite shaken up by it. I'd like to know if anyone else has seen anything like it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26030.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26030.html"],"Longitude":"-94.406357","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Independence","Date Submitted":"10/22/2010 12:34 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","Case Number":"26030","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.097616","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There was one other sighting in Independence on or around October 21st 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.097616,+-94.406357(26030)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26030) map </A>","Tags":"City","Summary":"Large orange glowing object moves slowly over Independence, MO","Log Number":"US-10222010-0010","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Missouri"}
