There was a orange, reddish, as bright as day looking sphere about thirty miles out to the left of my car as I was driving. It stayed in the same spot for about a minute and then disappeared. Then it reappeared about five miles from my car at an altitude of about nine or ten thousand feet. It moved at a northeast direction before disappearing again. Five minutes later it reappeared about five miles away in the front of my car at about the same altitude. At the same altitude the sphere moved consistently with my vehicle before shooting off to the south and disappearing. During the closest encounter my car radio went dead. It scared me and my girlfriend."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04012009-0003","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-119.049603","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.593871,+-119.049603(16357)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16357) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/31/2009 12:00 UTC"}
