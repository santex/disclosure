We were having a conversation when one of them pointed and said \"It's a UFO\". There were two reddish orange balls of light traveling Southwest. They were probably a quarter of a mile away from us, if that. We thought at first it was a very low flying prop-plane, but as it came closer, there was no sound and at one point the lights were vertical of each other. They appeared to move in tandem, rotating about 270 degrees counter clockwise, then slightly back. After that, one fizzled away, and the other disappeared to the South. I captured the sighting on my iPhone and will be uploading to youtube within a day with the title, \"UFO in Middlebury, IN\""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","City":"Middlebury","Object Shape":"Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Middlebury","There were no other sightings in Middlebury on or around September 26th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-09272012-0004","Longitude":"-85.679912","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42852.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"42852","Date Submitted":"09/27/2012 03:13 UTC","Summary":"Reddish orange lights seen by five workers in Middlebury, IN.","Region":"Indiana","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"41.661299"}
