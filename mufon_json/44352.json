I ran inside to get my camera and alerted my 10 year daughter, 16 year old son and my girlfriend. the craft began to move slowly east and began to flicker. Immediately after flickering two craft dropped out of the craft and descended straight down until no longer visible. My attempts to film only ended with short unfocused videos because its a new camera and I was unable to focus quickly enough. The craft then blinked out and immediately teleported west a few miles, then blinked out again and was gone."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.68893,+-117.993557(44352)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44352) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/04/2012 09:37 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.993557","Summary":"Orange UFO ejected two other objects","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-12062012-0003","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44352.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44352.html"],"trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There were no other sightings in Huntington Beach on or around December 4th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"12/06/2012 01:41 UTC"}
