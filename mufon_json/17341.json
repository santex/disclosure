It moved very fast around the city. Toward dusk and into the night I continually was able to see it and two other starlike objects repeatedly flying back and forth, zooming and slowing down for about an hour and a half. At this time, I can still see them. They are very high in the sky and I don't think satellites can move this quick, nor maneuver as the lights are doing."],"City":"San Antonio","Date Submitted":"06/04/2009 09:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.490738","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Log Number":"US-06042009-0018","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"06/04/2009 09:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around June 4th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.426022,+-98.490738(17341)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17341) map </A>"}
