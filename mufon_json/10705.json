I do not recall the exact time, but it would have been between 8 and 9.30pm. We were located at Mackerel Beach, which is west (across the bay) from Palm Beach and Barrenjoey Head (north of Sydney). We decided to go for a walk after Christmas dinner. It was a warm summer night, with a very bright full moon, and you could see clearly without the aid of a torch. There is a path that leads south from the beach, to a lookout on the headland, and it was our intention to walk up to this lookout, to see the bay under the light of the full moon. The first thing we noticed as we arrived at the beach, was the king tide that left us a very narrow path of sand to walk along, with mini tube waves crashing at the shore. These shore breakers where so strong, that they had dug a trench along the beach, and they were much stronger than the waves normally are at Mackerel Beach. As we were walking, I looked up, and saw on the horizon (above Palm Beach), a massive dome shaped ���mother ship���, flanked by two enormous cigar shaped objects. Even to this day I find it hard to believe what I saw, given the epic size of these objects. They where a dull grey color in the moon light, without any markings, seems or windows, and they remained completely motionless. It was the sense of depth, the ���3D��� effect, and the perfect symmetry of these objects, that rules out any possibility of them being clouds. My cousin was awe struck, as I recall, and she kept saying ���It���s the mother ship, it���s the mother ship!���. As is often the case, there was no noise associated with the objects, and as if they where some strange apparition, the objects promptly disappeared! We resumed our walk down the beach, with the bright silver moon overhead. We completed the short hike up the hill without incident, and from the top of the headland, the view of the bay and Barrenjoey Head was spectacular. In the bright moonlight, the water below was a sparkling silvery colour, as if it had magical properties. My cousin was the first person to see the flying saucer; I think I was talking our friend at the time. She remained silent, we didn���t notice it at first, but she was dumb struck as she stared at the horizon to the SE. She said something to get our attention, and when we looked in the direction she had been staring, we could see in the distance a flying saucer that was flashing randomly in different colours. My cousin told us that she had just seen it perform a maneuver where it was flying randomly in different directions, at an extremely high velocity. The object kept changing colour, and it had two round orange lights in the centre (reminiscent of eyes). The illustration shows the shape of the object, if you can imagine it changing through all different colors like a strobe light, and the outlines are like neon tubes, that is what it looked like. When I first saw it, it was in the distance, and moving towards us, occasionally changing direction. It was soon flying over the bay, where we could see it in more detail, as it was now much closer. I couldn���t really make out the object directly; it was the coloured lights that outlined its shape. As it flew right in front of and past us, it���s hard to describe the feelings of excitement and amasement that where going through me at the time. It was flying on an upward angle, and its path was pointed directly towards the moon (the moon at this time was about half way towards its midheaven). As it flew passed us, it continued gaining altitude, and it was getting smaller and smaller as it climbed, it looked as if it would fly to moon! When it had reached a point where it appeared, from our point of view, to be right in front of the moon (and smaller in comparison), it then dropped to a position below the moon, and quickly darted down and westward, until it was out of view behind the next headland to the north. At no time did the saucer make any noise. We waited for a short while on the rocky outcrop, hoping to see more UFOs, and excitedly discussing what we had just witnessed. At this point the water police arrived, I suspect that someone else had seen the object, and had called them to report ���strange coloured lights above the bay���, or something of the sort. As they cruised past, they had a bright flood light that where using in an attempt to search for the object. It���s interesting to note, that rather than having the searchlight pointed at the water���s surface, as if to look for a boat, they were moving the beam of light in upward arcs and all over the place, to examine the headlands and sky above them. Realising that we weren���t going to see any more UFOs that night, we started heading back to the house. I remember talking to my friend as we walked, who was quite excited, and he kept saying that he wasn���t sure if he believed in UFOs previously, but now, he was convinced beyond a doubt, that they do in fact exist."],"Case Number":"10705","City":"Palm Beach","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.713701,+-80.02822(10705)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10705) map </A>","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Summary":"Brief sighting of a huge dome and cigar shaped objects, followed by flying saucer sighting","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10705.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10705_submitter_file1__xmasufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10705.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10705.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"12/25/1996 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc, Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None, Dome"}
