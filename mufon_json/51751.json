I first saw a red pulsating light with a smaller white pulsating light following it. What caught my attention was there was no sound for how low they seems due to the size. I always watch the sky for helicopters and expected to start hearing a sound. But no sound then I noticed how the light seems to be traveling together because the spacing never changed. They were moving south from north at a regular flight speed for a helicopter. I was in awwww because of the red one and the fact I never heard any sound for how low they seemed. Just then I looked to my right and another red pulsating light was following to first two, in the same path, it looked just like the first red and same speed. All three equally faded off the more south they flew."]}
