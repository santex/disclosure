{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were packing a moving van to move to Denver on Oct 21, 2013. At 7pm I carried some boxes out to the truck where my husband was loading them in the back. When I walked up he said a UFO had been hovering over the mountain for about 20 minutes and although it hadn���t changed position he said the size was changing and sometimes it changed color from white to orange. We only lived 3 miles from the mountain and had a clear view so I looked over to our east and there was a bright light over the mountain. Since it was still light out there were no stars or planets showing so this bright light was the only thing in the sky and it was just hovering there. It was round and larger than any star or planet if they had been visible at that time. So we stood there watching it for about ten minutes and then it started to get bigger until it was twice as big as when I first saw it. The color also changed from bright white to orange and back to bright white again. Then it started to get smaller and within a minute or so just disappeared. My husband said he felt like it was watching him but I think anyone would have felt that way because it looked like a big eye in the sky. There were no spotlights, planes, helicopters, balloons, sounds or clouds at the time so it was definitely a UFO. I have seen other UFO's in the area in the two years I lived there so I wasn't alarmed by it, just excited. Unfortunately, it didn't occur to me to get the camera and take a picture of it."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Observed a bright light over the East Sandia mountains for 30 mins","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10222013-0013","Object Features":"Other","City":"Albuquerque","Date Submitted":"10/22/2013 11:50 UTC","Region":"New Mexico","Case Number":"51738","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51738.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51738.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-106.560053","Latitude":"35.168857","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.168857,+-106.560053(51738)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51738) map </A>","trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around October 21st 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"10/21/2013 07:00 UTC"}
