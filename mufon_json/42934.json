I noticed the odd color of the lights and i thought it was a plane at first, But they were traveling in like groups of three and moving not like any plane i have ever seen. There was numerous amounts of the lights. They would disappear after awhile. When i first noticed them i thought they were meteors coming right at me. But then i saw them moving awkwardly and knew it was something totally out of the ordinary. I lost sight of it when i went inside the batting cages, They were gone when i came back to my car."],"Log Number":"US-09302012-0027","Longitude":"-76.633591","Date Submitted":"09/30/2012 06:31 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 08:30 UTC"}
