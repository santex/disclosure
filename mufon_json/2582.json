At 3 am, looking up we realized somethingwas moving like a top on a table surface. Soon afterward we noticed another,this one much closer as we could see the colors of the exterior lights. Weattempted to photograph the objects, and notices several more. Upon laying onthe ground and looking up at the sky, about 12-15 of these objects were visibleat varying altitudes. We saw evidence of synchronized movement between the first2 that we saw. We stayed and watched for 2 12 hours. Most of the objectsresembled stars at first examination, but all were moving in the spinning topside to side and sometimes up and down motion, perhaps 2 degrees each direction.We both watch the sky regularly, and more so when we are in the mountains. Aclear sky last night allowed a tremendous view of the night sky. Neither of ushas ever seen stellar motion or any other object of that nature. We want toknow if any other sightings were reported on this event.
