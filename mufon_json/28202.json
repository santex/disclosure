At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter but it neither made any noise nor had any flashing lights. It came from an easterly direction and then turned to the north. It was not flying very fast and just cruised in the aforementioned direction. I stood there watching with great interest until I lost sight of it when it just dulled out and then disappeared. The sky here is very clear tonight."],"Latitude":"35.159434","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"28202","Log Number":"US-03112011-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28202.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28202.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-90.04314","Date Submitted":"03/11/2011 08:25 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.159434,+-90.04314(28202)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28202) map </A>"}
