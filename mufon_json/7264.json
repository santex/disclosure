I looked up at the sky to see if I could see anything that might resemble the Atlantis shuttle (it is on its way home this evening). I noticed two white lights around 9:34pm (Central) which were moving from west to east in the distance over our back field. They were moving at a fairly fast pace, although I have no idea what their altitude was. They retained the same distance from each other, and eventually faded off into the distance beneath a low-lying cloud. I brought my family outside to see the lights, because they seemed very differnt from the obvious planes that were also in the sky. There were no flashing red lights - only the constant white light. Martin county is very close the Crane Naval base, so we thought it may be military aircraft, but the constant distance between the two lights seemed too precise. Maybe it was related to the ISS or Atlantis, afterall - I don't know much about them??"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Moving Lights","Latitude":"38.676994","Date Submitted":"06/20/2007 09:34 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/20/2007 09:34 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
