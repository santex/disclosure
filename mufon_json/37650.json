I ran back inside and told my brother in law and niece to come outside. We obsereved them coming from the west and heading east. They were in a triangle formation, but I could tell that it wasnt one object but three because each one moved a little to the left or right on its own. It took them about five minutes to reach us and they were almost right above us when two of them slowly disapered. The last one was bright for about another minute before it disapered."],"Date of the Event":"04/22/2012 12:00 UTC"}
