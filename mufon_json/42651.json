My initial thought was wow the street lights are really bright. It was so bright my eyes couldn't focus for about 5 seconds, in which that time came my second thought- that isnt a streetlight thats the moon. Then my eyes focused and I realized the orb was moving in a downward pattern. It almost looked like a plane was on fire and crashing. I thought holy sh*t, there is going to be a plane crash less than a mile from my house. Then it started going in circles and changing colors. The pattern it was moving was like a vertical figure 8, but it would sometimes stop and reverse path. This lasted for about 30 seconds. It started as the very bright vibrant orange and slowly turned a dark red. Towards the end it turned white. At this point I realized I was witnessing something crazy as I completely ruled out star, meteor, helicopter, plane, crashing plane, and any other type of flying device I had ever saw. I ran upstair to get my cell phone to video this. When I returned to the window downstairs it had alradey began its straight line path to the east northeast. It was bright white at this point and looked like the slowest shooting star ever. Way too big to be a plane even at this point. I began video taping and witnessed it look like it exploded red twice before it left sight. Craziest sh*t I ever witnessed."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.450275,+-79.989646(42651)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42651) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"40.450275","Case Number":"42651","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around September 18th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-09192012-0001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
