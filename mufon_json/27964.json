I was laying in bed and looked out my window and saw 2 lights (one extremely bright) so I focused on the brightest. Both of them moved North slowly. The smaller one dimmed out very quickly. The brightest one moved very slowly and once it dimmed it's lights it shot out (I could see it because the light wasn't completely out) very quickly and in an erratic pattern. It was nothing like a plane moves. I was stunned and amazed. I listened to the news and looked in the papers for any reports but haven't found any. I can't say if it had sound or not because I sleep with earplugs to drown our my husbands snoring. I sure would like to know if anyone else saw what I saw."],"Region":"California","Longitude":"-121.525364","Case Number":"27964","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in West Sacramento","There were no other sightings in West Sacramento on or around February 23rd 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"02/23/2011 04:30 UTC","Latitude":"38.581761","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Log Number":"US-02232011-0010","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.581761,+-121.525364(27964)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27964) map </A>","City":"West Sacramento","Summary":"Bright lights (2) moving slow and dimmed and shot away","Date Submitted":"02/23/2011 04:37 UTC"}
