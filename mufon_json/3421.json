The object looked to be like a glowing orb of light very spherical and it is hard to determine the size because I do not know the distance it was from me. I only saw it briefly the one time although; I parked near to the sighting and looked for several minutes to see if it would reappear. It did not reappear and I gave up the vigil after a few minutes. I found out about MUFON after photographing Scott Arnett, an Investigator for Louisiana and Mississippi, for a newspaper article."],"Longitude":"-90.4612","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Louisiana","City":"Hammond","Case Number":"3421","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
