{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI have numerous photos that have objects in the pictures from this day, that were not visable to the eye while taking the photos. Some are like these three cylinder shapes. I have others that are spheres in formation. If you would like to see those, just email me. I took all the photos on BURST MODE, so the camera took 4 or 5 photos at a time. The objects appear in one photo and are gone in the next photo, with exception to the objects that are moving in formation for numerous photos. I can email those to you if you like, but I will give you these three to start with and hopefully explain or ID. I saved the whole series of 244 photos to a CD. Please DO NOT post these photos on the MUFON site. They are for MUFON to review ONLY."],"Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10322.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10322.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10322.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Warrenville","There was one other sighting in Warrenville on or around July 20th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"41.817807","Log Number":"US-04142008-0005","Date of the Event":"07/20/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Objects unable to see with the eye while shooting pictures of the moon.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.817807,+-88.173402(10322)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10322) map </A>","Longitude":"-88.173402","City":"Warrenville","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"10322","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","Date Submitted":"07/20/2007 12:00 UTC"}
