Then it stopped above the tree tops around half a mile away and it slowly descended down behind the trees. I know this was not an airplane and it was not a helicopter. I watched for a few minutes but it never reappeared."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.234631","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Savannah","There were no other sightings in Savannah on or around September 26th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Summary":"Flat object with about 6 to 7 red and white lights visible descending behind trees about half a mile from my house.e.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.227293","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.227293,+-88.234631(32122)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32122) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Savannah"}
