I looked at it intensely while it was in view and I could not tell what I was looking at - it was unlike anything I've seen before. It looked like it was moving directly over downtown Denver. It was moving at a decent rate and within a few seconds went behind a building in the foreground and I lost sight of it. I didn't see it again. An airplane went by shortly thereafter on about the same route. The object was MUCH larger than the plane I saw just after. As soon as I got in my car I realized I had truly just seen an unidentified flying object especially since I saw a plane after it which looked so completely different in the sky."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.740914,+-104.981783(17573)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17573) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/20/2009 09:36 UTC","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around June 20th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"06/20/2009 09:36 UTC","Latitude":"39.740914"}
