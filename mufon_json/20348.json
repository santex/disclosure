As I was walking home i noticed a little ball of colorful light and looked at the object through my binoculars. That was when I saw a circle object that had colors changing going all over it. As i watched it the object moved in a triangle pattern counter clockwise. I also noticed that the object had smaller white circles on the inside edge of the circle object. I walked a little forward toward it and it was gone."]}
