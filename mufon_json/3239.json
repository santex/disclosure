It wasn't the aeromed, just a huge helicopter. Grabbed the camera and snapped a picture, watched the blinking light so I could take a second picture before it got out of view, and they were there underneath it. I wasn't sure if it was spots on my glasses, or something real. But the sun was glaring off them. And they showed up in the picture. They came in from the Southeast, almost directly at me. Then they were gone, not slow acceleration, just zero to gone in a split second, if there was noise it was covered by the helicopter noise."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Orleans","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.068643,+-85.135012(3239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3239) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06242005-0001","Date of the Event":"06/23/2005 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Looked like they flew in to see the helicoper, then left."}
