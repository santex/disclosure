I went in my back yard and looked at it, at first because of the blinking lights you would think it was a plane, but it didnt move it stayed in the same place. So i went back to the front where ppl had binoculars and i asked to see with them. I saw and very noticably it was changing colors from red, blue and green and white. it was there for at least an hour, thats when i stopped watching. Several ppl saw the same thing."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.313655","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21362.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21362.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"flying object with blinking lights","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.073902,+-117.313655(21362)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21362) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cross","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01052010-0005","Case Number":"21362","Latitude":"34.073902","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"California","City":"Colton","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Colton","There were no other sightings in Colton on or around January 4th 2010"]}
