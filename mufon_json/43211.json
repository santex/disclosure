When I realized a fleet of orange lights in the sky. Descending upon the lights of south mountain. All moving in one directional path, with no organization of it, all the orbs were scattered all over the place. Like a cooralation graph. For about 5 minutes these orb like things kept coming, then decreased to about to about 4. Though this creeped me out more than the haunted house."]}
