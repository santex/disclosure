When I saw what appeared to be a huge triangle in the sky. I pointed it out to every one and we were all amazed. Then I saw a faint light in the center so i pointed that out to them to and not a second after i said \"hey look at the little light in the middle\" the very faint light all of a sudden got real real bright and moved across a large portion of the sky from north to south in seconds and then came from an amazing speed to a dead stop. I look at my friends and we found each other speachless then looked back and watched it dissapear to nothing."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/20/2006 09:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-08212006-0003","Date Submitted":"08/20/2006 09:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cylinder","City":"Salem","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Oregon","Latitude":"44.944048","Case Number":"5280","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around August 20th 2006"],"Summary":"I saw a faint light in the sky then it turned to a very bright white and flew north to south and in seconds it was gone","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.944048,+-123.026256(5280)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5280) map </A>","Tags":"City"}
