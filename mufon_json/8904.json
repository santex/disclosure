{"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi do not remember the date. we were on the west side of the salton sea. it had been dark for about 1\\2 hour; we had just finished riding our dirt bikes. i left the motor home to get in my truck to drive home. i was admiring the bright stars. in the southeast sky five lights appeared one by one. they were high in the sky and in a straight line and the same distance apart. the lights did not move at all and appeared for 30-45 sec. i am guessing but the distance between the first and last light was about 1 1\\2 miles. the lights simply went out after 30-45 sec. i immediately new the objects were foreign. they lights were too straight, too bright, too far apart and did not move at all. i was very excited and yelled for my friend to get out of the motor home. as soon as i heard the door shut was when the lights disappeared. and of course he laughed when i told the story. i never told it again until now. thank, kurt"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"8904","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8904.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8904.html"],"Region":"California","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.30734","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Salton City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Salton City","There were no other sightings in Salton City on or around March 11th 2006"],"Date Submitted":"03/11/2006 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01152008-0047","Longitude":"-115.948511","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/11/2006 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.30734,+-115.948511(8904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8904) map </A>","Summary":"series of lights appeared in the sky in a straight line","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
