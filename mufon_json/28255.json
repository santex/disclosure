(anti-gravity) the who bible is full of clouds that talk; take up jesus; glow at night and a pillar by day; ect... it goes on and on. jesus when he accended into the \"clouds\" said he would be back the way he accended; all the signs are here that jesus said the world condition would be.one of the signs is\"signs from the sky\"!!! i believe ufo's are angels; good and bad...as in demons or fallen angels; and the guardian angels that modern man talks about; comes from a verse that says; i will give my angels charge round about you ;to guard you in all your ways! i believe; because of the ii kings chapter 6 that only certain people can see them. that they may be there all the time..and maybe the walk in apple hill were my angels watching out for me and telling me that they are here and not to worry. read that bible...all you ufo folks! enjoy."],"Case Number":"28255","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Placerville","There were no other sightings in Placerville on or around February 18th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28255.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28255.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Summary":"walking my dogs in apple hill orchards in Camino California; saw ufo at high altitude","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.734245,+-120.789206(28255)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28255) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/18/2011 04:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
