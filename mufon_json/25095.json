It was a very cloudy day with the potential of storms. I looked up at the clouds when I was walking infront of the local bank and saw the clouds looked awesome so I quickly took a picture on my iPhone and continued on my way. Two weeks later on August 14, 2010 I was looking through the pictures on my iPhone when i noticed on the cloud picture, after the menu bar went away, that their was a weird object in between the hydro lines. I really dont know how to explain this picture, it honestly doesnt look like a bird and thats the only thing that would be flying in the air because I know there were no plaines in the air at that time."],"Date of the Event":"08/02/2010 02:27 UTC","Case Number":"25095","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-08142010-0005","Summary":"Took a picture of some weird clouds and a couple weekes later I noticed there was a weird object in the picture I couldn't explain.","Latitude":"49.903294","Date Submitted":"08/14/2010 03:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25095_submitter_file1__clouds.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25095.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
