My father in law and i were having a cigarette in my backyard. He noticed it 1st. He pointed and said look at that. We couldn't explain what it was. It wasn't a jet or a plane or a helicopter. We were baffled. It was a glowing orange circular orb like object. It made no sound at all. It seemed to be brighter on the bottom and and glowing on the top all orange. Almost like a hot air balloon. Not sure if they fly at night or not? But it moved to fast across the sky to be a hot air balloon. It moved across the sky from left to right (west to east) in a straight line at about the height a helicopter would fly. Not to high. There was no engine sound at all. Strangely quiet. It only lasted about 20 seconds and then vanished over the horizon."],"Region":"Ontario","Source":"MUFON"}
