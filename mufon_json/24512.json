{"Log Number":"US-07142010-0015","Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were about to go to the store when my wife said \"look how twinkly that star is!\" I looked up and it was just a bright star but now we were watching the sky. My wife said, \"look at that over there, that's a plane flying high right?\" I said, \"no planes have flashing lights.\" We then decided that it was still too bright outside to see a sattelite as we could only see Venus and one other star at the time. It was confirmed, in my mind, not to be a sattelite when it flew in an arcing type path silently pusating and moving in front of and behind clouds. We lost sight of it when below the tree line of the neighboring street."],"Case Number":"24512","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Utah","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-111.99715","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24512.html"],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in West Valley City","There were no other sightings in West Valley City on or around July 13th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Summary":"Pulsating orb moving in front of and behind clouds.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.701463,+-111.99715(24512)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24512) map </A>","City":"West Valley City","Date of the Event":"07/13/2010 09:40 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/14/2010 02:17 UTC","Latitude":"40.701463","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None"}
