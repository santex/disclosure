I went into the backyard and I heard voices behind my fence out on the road. I went to grab my propane tank and i noticed the bright lights in the sky. I woke up my wife and sons. I went in and grabbed my camcorder. I recorded 12 mins. of the 30 mins it was in the sky.The three blue lights circled clockwise most of the time then they slowed down and started turning counter clockwise. The flashing red light would disappear at times. I also noticed a dark round circle in the middle.As well as some weird lights in the middle that seemed to move around.I also recorded it taking off.There was also several other people out on the road behind my house that witnessed it and called 911. Not sure what this means but the following afternoon 2 f-16's buzzed our neighborhood according to several of my neighbors.
