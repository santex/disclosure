We then stopped at the Arco gas station and began taking pictures with our cell phone camera. The pictures obviously do the event no justice but at least we caught them. One of the pictures has serious motion blur and cause the lights to take the shape of nines. So just know that the objects did not in any way look like that to my eyes."],"Latitude":"45.506226","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.506226,+-122.944966(45902)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45902) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45902.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45902.html"],"Region":"Oregon","City":"Hillsboro","Log Number":"US-02252013-0014","Object Features":"Other, Unknown"}
