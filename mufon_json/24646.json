While tracking this satellite we unexpectedly observed a very large burst of bright white light that illuminated the whole night sky in the area we were looking. This circle of light resembled a tube with it darker in the center and as we were watching, a large cigar shaped dark object came out of this circle and exited down and out, stopped and made a couple of turns and moved a short distance and come to a stop. After this object came to a stop, the circle of light closed up and went out. The object could not be seen after that point. It was very close to what one has seen in the movies such as Stargate and other various movies and TV shows. The whole event was very clear and it lasted around three to four seconds with both of us observing the same thing."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/19/2010 04:26 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24646.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24646.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Large burst of light, cigar shaped object came out, turned and stoped, light went out.
