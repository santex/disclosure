Lights were not blinking, and no sound was heard. Speed felt fairly slow... the triangle shape remain steady throughout the observation until I lost visibility behind a tree and house. It was striking weird to all people around me who witness this (about 6 person) First thing that came to mind was 3 planes in formation, but the color of the light and the fact that no sound could be heard was rather strange. See link for video I shot with my phone."],"Longitude":"-96.696986","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/16/2013 10:40 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Plano","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45789.html"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.026413,+-96.696986(45789)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45789) map </A>","Summary":"Yellow triangle shape lights over Plano TX","Case Number":"45789","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
