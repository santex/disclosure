{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Monday, August 25, 2008 I was driving eastbound on Third Street in Williamsport PA when I took two pictures while driving with my LG EnV2 2.0 mega pixel camera phone of the Goodyear blimp. After reviewing the pictures later that day I noticed an object on the second picture of a cigar shaped object above the Goodyear blimp. The day was clear and sunning without a visible cloud ceiling at 12:15 hrs EST. I was driving approximately 10-15 mph near the Rite Aid at 1913 E. 3rd Street in Williamsport in Loyalsock Twp. I noticed the Goodyear blimp off to my right and decided to take a picture of it since it was flying around Williamsport after the Little League World series games. A minute later the blimp was directly in front of me when I decided to take the second picture. I held the phone camera with both hands and braced both arms against the steering wheel to stabilize the picture and snapped it. After returning from the trip, I reviewed the pictures taken and noticed an object to be cigar shaped above the blimp at a 1 o���clock position when the picture was zoomed in on the blimp."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.24857,+-76.992769(12239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12239) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08272008-0010","Object Shape":"Cigar","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/25/2008 12:14 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"12239","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12239.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12239_submitter_file1__0825081214.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12239_submitter_file2__0825081214a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12239.html"],"Latitude":"41.24857","Summary":"Picture of a cigar shaped object above the Goodyear blimp in Williamsport PA while driving","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/25/2008 12:14 UTC","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Williamsport","There were no other sightings in Williamsport on or around August 25th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"Williamsport","Longitude":"-76.992769"}
