It moved at a Slow pace from South to North No noise was heard it was almost like it was floating in the sky and no it wasn���t a weather balloon it���s altitude wasn���t very high. It had what appeared to be ports on the side of the object which appeared to in circle this cigar shaped ship. Can���t remember the exact date but it was witnessed by myself and my sister I believe the time frame was mid 70���s to early 80���s ��� Why haven���t I mentioned this to anyone before now, Well I didn���t know about M.U.F.O.N or I would have - I also read the Project Blue that was released to the Public ��� I Believe they should have called Project White Wash, That���s about all it was The so called Investigation into the Possibility of Exterterestrials Visiting our planet was have explained the real truth, They intimidated those who did report such sightings and stated they where only a few reports that couldn���t be explained they used the usual excuses, Swamp Gas,Blimps, Aircraft, Stars and even Hysteria ��� My Question is how would they explain Mass Hysteria considering all the UFO sightings that were reported throughout the years even back to the ancient times.. I as well as my sister have observed several UFO���s of different shapes colors and sizes of which when you contact me about the copy write of my stories I will be glad to help fill your data files. Can you imagine how many reports that went not reported for fear of being called crazy or more intimation from the Military? ��� MN 6-05-2012 date written 06-05-2012."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-87.692507","Country":"United States","Region":"Kentucky","Case Number":"38906"}
