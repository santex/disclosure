I noticed one of the stars getting brighter then dimmer. I went in to get my camera, and I really didn't think I would get any clear photos because I have tried to take photos at night with my camera and nothing ever shows up. Well I have photos of exactly what I saw. At one point the orb was as bright of the moon. You can tell in my photos that it definately is not the moon. It had got really bright then went back to the size of a star again then vanished. This is not the first time I have seen weird lights in the sky here. It's the first time that I had my camera though. i have way more photos but there is only enough for three. I will send the rest soon. The weird orb began to move and left weird patterns and streaks."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Louisiana","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
