I first thought these were Jupiters moons but upon investigation on the internet I soon realized you're not supposed to see Jupiter's moons without aid. Also they were not in the correct formation. All six of these lights were white, non blinking like stars and were sitting in a some what pyramid formation on the right side of Jupiter. I looked at them with binoculars and got a much clearer view of them, I think they appeared much to large to be Jupiter's moons. As far as I know there is no constalation and as I said they were all white and non blinking like stars. Not sure what to make of it. My parents were also observers of this event."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"37110","Log Number":"US-04032012-0022","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Strange White Lights Next to Jupiter","Date Submitted":"04/03/2012 08:58 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37110.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"28.280176"}
