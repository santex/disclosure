I saw a rather large circle,, much larger than a star, moving in a staight path. It was about 40 seconds, then I couldn't see it due to trees blocking the view. It was a circle, white and looked just like a cloud, only it was a circle and it moved, and the circle shape never changed. It was not a cloud, it looked different than a cloud, it was cloud like. It moved straight like an object. Latter a plane flew over, it was a larger white plane, which I thought was odd, because all we see is small aircraft, or passenger jets."],"Summary":"moving circle cloud like","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Goshen","There were no other sightings in Goshen on or around July 30th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/02/2011 09:38 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"07/30/2011 12:00 UTC"}
