It looked like a big silver square i could see the heat coming off of the exhaust or what ever was holding it in the air. After i passed this i headed up te hill to my house and got a shower to head over my girlfriends house. I headed back down the road i came up toward her house. when i got to the bottom of state line road it was still there! but much higher in the air and it still had that exhaust heat stream from the bottom. i slowed down again to make sure what i was looking at. i pulled over with 3 or 4 cars and watched this thing go higher and higher up in the sky . whatever it was it didnt care we were watching. Hope ypu guys can figure ths out it was weird. this is awesome i never belived in this [pd]."],"Latitude":"39.218388","Date of the Event":"10/14/2008 05:37 UTC","Longitude":"-84.856063","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13055.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13055.html"],"Tags":"City","City":"Bright","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
