I saw Venus in the W SW and Mars was S ofme. I looked toward my right and saw what I thought was another very bright,white colored planet. I was curious and gazed at it when a light cloud came infront of it and partially obscured the light. I stood and waited for the cloudto pass but when it did the light was gone. Im sure there is a naturalexplaination for this but I dont know what it would be. It was stationary whileI was gazing at it and it could be that I mistook its fading out behind thelight cloud for the light actually travelling away from me. I was calm theentire time and very curious. I was never frightened or nervous but a littleannoyed that I lost sight of it before I could identify what it was."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Country":"United States","City":"Bartlesville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/30/2003 06:00 UTC","Latitude":"36.747311","Region":"Oklahoma","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.747311,+-95.980818(2976)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2976) map </A>"}
