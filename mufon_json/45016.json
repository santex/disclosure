It was about 5:30 AM. I had just finished one of my work-out routines. I took a couple of steps leaned against a park table and looked up. In the dark between the trees I saw two very bright objects moving north by northwest and together very slowly, one behind and to the left of the other. I watched for about 10 seconds as they both slowly disappeared together. They were going too slowly for satellites or airplanes. They just seemed to appear all at once and slowly disappeared together at the same time."],"Latitude":"34.133556","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around January 4th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-01042013-0013","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-118.277307","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"Two bright objects moving and disappearing together.","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"45016","Country":"United States"}
