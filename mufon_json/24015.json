I grabbed a small pair of binoculers and I could see a large orange shape with a short (about one and a half times the shape) tail also bright orange like fire. I noticed it seemed to stop moving, then began going in the other direction but more like a v pattern. it was certainly too bright to be an airplane, and did not continue its course to be a meteor."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Greenfield","There were no other sightings in Greenfield on or around June 28th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-06282010-0016","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Teardrop","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24015.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24015.html"],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"42.595976","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/28/2010 09:40 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.595976,+-72.591904(24015)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24015) map </A>","Summary":"A large orange object with an orange tail, traveling slowly toward me, then began going the other way.
