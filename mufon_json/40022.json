Before she even said anything I had already observed the 3 lights aligned in a triangle form in the southeastern sky. At first I thought they were stars since they weren't moving and of a white color, but then they each brightened up a bit individually then dimmed out one at a time. Not too far away from that was another object pulsing red, but moving in the direction where the triangle was, and I observed closely to make sure it wasn't a plane, but after it traveled a short distance, it also vanished in mid air. The pulsing of it was different than a plane also. It was not cloudy in the sky, so it didn't go behind a cloud. We both agreed that we had witnessed something extraordinary that evening."],"Case Number":"40022","Region":"North Carolina"}
