{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was waiting for a bus at the station and off in the distance (not sure how far), a faint flash caught my attention in the sky. It blended in quite well to the cloudless, sunny sky. I observed an object, cigar-like in shape, on a straight and downward path at first, then the object became smaller and spherical in shape. It stopped moving after a bit and stayed in one spot, where it seemed to have vanished completely. I was unable to continue to view it as I was traveling at that point. Prior to leaving the station (and after it \"vanished\"), I had noticed an airplane in another part of the sky opposite the ufo. It was lower in the sky than the object I observed, and there was a clear contrail whereas the object made none."],"Summary":"Cigar shaped day ufo changes to sphere, vanishes.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.809603,+-120.551481(49172)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49172) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/24/2013 07:22 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"43.809603","Region":"Oregon","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar, Sphere","Log Number":"US-07252013-0003","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Case Number":"49172","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"07/25/2013 01:57 UTC","Longitude":"-120.551481","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49172.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49172.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
