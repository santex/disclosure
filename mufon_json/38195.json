Tried to look at it with binoculars, which were difficult to steady. Object was moving north or northeast, so it became lower on the horizon as I watched. Light was too bright and moved too fast to be a star. If I had to narrow down the description, I'd say I was watching flames from the back of a rocket of some kind - bright white to yellowish white, but red at the trailing end. If it was flames from a rocket, I could not see the rocket itself. Last week's sighting was at about 9 PM and it was farther west; tonight around 10 PM it was farther north. The International Space Station does occasionally pass overhead, but it only stays visible for a few minutes at a time, so this object was not the ISS. Never saw anything in the newspapers last week about such a sighting."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright light/object north-northwest from Bay Area skies","Case Number":"38195","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were 2 other sightings in San Francisco on or around May 16th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/16/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","City":"San Francisco"}
