At first I thought it was a part of the St. Joseph Hospital renovation, but then I noticed that it was not over the hospital. The lights were in a triangle formation. There were a few helicopters flying towards it. The object was hovering and it didn't remind me of an airplane or helicopter."],"Date of the Event":"12/05/2012 06:05 UTC","Longitude":"-83.287387","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/05/2012 10:36 UTC","Log Number":"US-12052012-0021","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44345.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44345.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States"}
