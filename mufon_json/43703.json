About 20:00 I came out for a cigarette. There were no clouds, only the stars and a bright moon. Then I saw a small object flying at high altitude. I thought it was some satellite passes over. I've seen them hundreds of times. But suddenly I spot second object flying parallel to the first one. Suddenly second object changed direction and began to approach the first one. Then for a next 15 - 20 seconds I saw these two objects like playing with each other. They changed direction, accelerate, slowed down, overtake each other. They look like living creatures, playing with each other, like two birds or flys, but they were very high and glowed orange-pink light. They were too fast to be a airplanes or something like this. Then flew off the roof of the building next door. I quickly went into the street, but the street lamps were too bright and I lost them. I've seen a lot of things in the sky which I can explained like : satellites, meteors, iridium flares, etc, but this was something very strange and inexplicable for me."],"Date of the Event":"11/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/04/2012 07:48 UTC","City":"High Wycombe"}
