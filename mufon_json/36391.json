It was near the area of the Toledo Express Airport in the southwest part of the sky. I watched the object and it began moving irradically up,down,side to side and I knew it wasn't a plane. I found my binoculars and looked at the object and could see a disc shaped object with the lights spinning around. I watched it approximately 5 minutes and took another look without the binoculars. When I tried to view it again with the binoculars it disappeared. March 8 the same object was appeared in the same area and I watched it for about ten minutes and it had the same lights and appearance."],"Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Toledo","Case Number":"36391","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Toledo","There was one other sighting in Toledo on or around March 7th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-03112012-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36391.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36391.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.671338","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Bright white light with red light under travelled near Toledo Express Airport .
