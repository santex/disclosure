Some were swimming, others sitting around enjoying the fireworks from all of the surrounding homes. Suddenly one of the kids said, \"Hey! What is that?\" Everyone outside and inside the home were facing North at the time. I believe all attendees at the party witnessed what the child pointed at. Five to six orange balls floated about in the distant sky (approximately a quarter of a mile away and about 500-600 feet above the terrain). These glowing orbs seemed to move with a type of intent or purpose outlining geometrical shapes, triangles, semi-circles, etc. After much discussion we collectively ruled out fireworks due to the nature and behavior of the objects. (Fireworks do not hang suspended for extended periods of time, fly in suspended formations both rising and falling, rising again, and then slowly shrink out of existence.) The predominate feeling discussed by all was one of wonder and curiosity. Though one or two children did get quite scared. This was compounded on our trip home by an intense, blinding fog. Quite sorry that we did not get any pictures or videos but typically none of us ever have brought any cameras to our celebrations save for anniversaries, weddings, etc.."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 10:35 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 10:35 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17894.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17894.html"],"Log Number":"US-07062009-0039","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Longitude":"-86.110838","Tags":"City","Case Number":"17894","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Granger","Latitude":"41.753382","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Granger","There were no other sightings in Granger on or around July 4th 2009"]}
