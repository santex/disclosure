It arced down ...its heading NE at top of visible arc and down to the ESE OR SSE out of vision near horizon in 3-5 seconds. It was big enough , if far away , to make me think of the \"Dinosaurs Extinction\" and I waited a little nervously for its impact sound which didn't occur. So I thought it probably landed far away or burned up completely before it hit . Since it was a fireball , I assumed it was passing through the earth's atmosphere and was possibly space garbage reentering like the French ESA craft loaded with garbage will if it hasen't already, as it descends from the ISS. It is the largest meteor (shooting star) I have ever seen , if thats what it was. I reported it to the US Airforce and to NICAP and Montgomery County Police."],"Date of the Event":"05/13/2008 11:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","Country":"United States","Region":"Maryland","Summary":"Saw large comet like fieball - fireball angle to horizon 60-70deg steep arc down to horizon- Direction ENE to ESE","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10748.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10748.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Wheaton","Log Number":"US-05142008-0009","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/13/2008 11:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.047891,+-77.053696(10748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10748) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"10748","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-77.053696","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
