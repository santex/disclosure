(not devin) these galaxies reminded me of the falun wheel, in falun dafa's teachings of the buddha school. i think their a warning for human kind or for those who witnessed them not to miss the truth that people don���t see with distractions in our world these days. i know their are aliens but i don't care. i cultivate buddha hood so theirs an issue of nobility. this takes great importance to me so i wanted to share. anyways my name is jerrod i witnessed this & wanted to share it was north of wheat ridge as if 50 or a 100 miles away yet they were still visible as they descended fading from their flam likeness before seeming to hit the groined. then light was flashing maybe like silent lightning. i saw a black helicopter flying that way 15 minutes latter.. if people are covering up these things i find it ridicules! human beings are very special & we have nothing to gain by working with the grays. human beings can cultivate buddha hood & return to the heavens yet those beings belong just down here! this is my thought of the 4 changing objects that left tails when moving as ball's & formed into a cross then turned into discs like the ones shown in falun buddha law. these thoughts are my own. falun dafa healed my spine from scoliosis many years ago so i can walk full time. it teaches truth-compassion-tolerance thank you for reading (name moved to fi box) cms 09\\14\\11 07:41 cst flg oh yes. i know of those who care deeply for god or have mead a habit of the formalities of realigion. i think maybe this phonamena is for you to look wihin to e saved. i cultivate buddha hood, so this is just my thought ps, maybe pictures or videos will turn up"],"Case Number":"31796","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/12/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.773668","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/13/2011 08:25 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.773668,+-105.067836(31796)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31796) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-105.067836","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31796.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31796.html"],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Other","Log Number":"US-09132011-0017","Region":"Colorado"}
