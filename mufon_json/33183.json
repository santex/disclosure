The object was below the scattered cloud cover and started descending slowly. I pulled over to the side of the street and exited the car with a digital photo camera. A bystander that was in his driveway also looked up and asked what the object was. I explained that I could not identify it either and that is why I started to take photographs. I observed the object for several minutes as it slowly moved southbound across the eastern horizon and took a number of photographs of the object until it slowly moved out of sight. There was absolutely no indication that the object was any sort of known aircraft or balloon especially due to the brightness and color of the object which was as bright in the sky as the moon and remained a red-orange hue for the duration of the flightpath observed."],"Longitude":"-122.711697"}
