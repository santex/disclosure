We are approx. 25 miles from Charlotte airport an see many planes decending for a landing or taking off. I happened to look to the south west over the roof of the mobile as something caught my eye I assume. There were one or two enlongated thin cyndrical objects above the trees. It could have been one object due to atmospheric conditions. They were bright as if having the sun reflected off of it or them. They bounced around for the most part for id say 20 mins max. The object then sped off and disappeared. It was a clear morning for the most part."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
