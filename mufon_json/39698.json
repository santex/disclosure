I was not scared, but fascinated. I spent the afternoon telling my brother about previous experiences and then joked that they were listening to me from my implant from a childhood abduction, which he remembers as well. my niece claimed to see a ufo while we were discussing it. I dont like to sound paranoid, but I feel I am being observed."],"Date of the Event":"06/21/2012 08:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-89.417442","Case Number":"39698","Latitude":"40.703234","Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39698.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39698.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around June 21st 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.703234,+-89.417442(39698)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39698) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
