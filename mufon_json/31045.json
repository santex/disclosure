{"Log Number":"US-08202011-0015","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I was driving home from work at roughly 11:10pm, I saw a formation of 4 glowing red lights in a straight line. After viewing them in awe for several seconds, the 2nd red light from the top appeared to \"break formation\" if you will, listing to my right (the object's left) and a second or two after said movement, it appeared as though the red lights scattered in numerous directions. It was at this point that the skyline was blocked by trees and I lost sight of these lights several seconds later. The whole sighting experience lasted roughly 15-20 seconds. I was alert to the western sky (where the sighting took place) the rest of my commute home which was approximately another 7 miles home. I am somewhat of an astronomy nerd, and I can tell you in all of the star observation I have done I know what a star, planet, airplane, satellite and the ISS looks like in the night sky, and this series of lights was unlike anything I have ever witnessed."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Michigan","Latitude":"42.547031","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/19/2011 11:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Walled Lake","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31045.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31045.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"I saw lights in the sky","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","Tags":"City","Case Number":"31045","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.547031,+-83.479768(31045)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31045) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/20/2011 06:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Walled Lake","There were no other sightings in Walled Lake on or around August 19th 2011"],"Longitude":"-83.479768"}
