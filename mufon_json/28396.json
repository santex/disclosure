HUSBAND NOTICED TO THE SOUTH A FORMATION OF AIRCRAFT WHICH APPEARED LIKE A VERY LOW-FLYING AIRPLANE. AT THE SAME TIME TO THE WEST NORTHWEST I SAW A BRIGHT GREEN LIGHT FALLING IN A SOUTH TO NORTH STRAIGHT PATTERN IN A SLOW DESCENT TOWARD THE GROUND. ITS APPEARANCE WAS SIMILAR TO A SHOOTING STAR, BUT MUCH LARGER, BRIGHT GLOWING GREEN, AND FOLLOWED BY WHAT LOOKED LIKE A TRAIL OF FIRE. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS WAS A SHOOTING STAR. IMMEDIATELY AFTER ITS DISAPPEARANCE INTO THE TREELINE, THE AIRCRAFT TO THE SOUTH GOT CLOSER TO OUR HOME AND TURNED OUT TO BE 3 HELICOPTERS FLYING IN A TIGHT TRIANGULAR FORMATION. THE LEAD HELICOPTER SEEMED TO HAVE A SEARCH LIGHT ON. THE REAR TWO HELICOPTERS HAD NO SPOTLIGHT, ONLY A RED INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE FRONT OF THE CRAFT. THEY CONTINUED IN A NORTHBOUND FLIGHT AND DISAPPEARED."],"Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"03/25/2011 12:08 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
