{"divs":["Sighting Details At 3pm P.D.T. I heard many jet aircraft flying above my neighborhood. I went outside to see what was going on. I observed more than 8 aircraft flying above at a high rate of speed .There were all types of aircraft.I paused and looked up and then saw a rectangular object with red sides . As I looked up the object appeared to be high in the air and must have been large as the jets passed under \"the object\". As I stood in the driveway ,a mailtruck on its route pulled up next to my box. I asked the mailman if he had a moment to look and see if he could see anything.As he handed me my mail he agreed to take a look . As we stood in the driveway to my house the mailman said,\" oh yes I see it\" . We stood there together for several minutes and then the mailman said \" wow, look , it appears to be going up higher\" . At that time we both observed the red color on the side of the object to glow really bright. Then there appeared to be a yellow flash in the middle of the object and the whole thing became bright. I asked the mailman his name and he replied ,\" Phillip\". Then as we observed the object it darted sideways and startled us. I became so nervous I asked the mailman his name again. He appeared to beginning to become nervous also . He said he was getting out of here . As he left he grabbed a cellphone he began talking in a foreign language in a very \"excited\" manner . After that I went in to grab some binoculars ,came outside but whatever it was I could not find. For several hours jets flew from every direction over the area. My name is William J.
