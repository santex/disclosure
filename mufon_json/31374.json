{"Log Number":"US-09012011-0003","Longitude":"-86.578947","Region":"Tennessee","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my pool on a clear night when I noticed 3 lights in a triangle formation hovering South-West of Nashville. I watched them for a period of 45 minutes hovering at times. At the time it was hovering there was another small UFO flying back from one light of the boomerang to the opposite light with extreme, maneuvering. I thought that it could be planes, but after I noticed the size, way over 300ft this could not be planes moving in the same speed and direction. The lights were at the tip and at the ends of it. The lights were pulsating from rose colored to red to pink. The smaller ufo was leaving a slight blue and red trail behind it (like a shooting star), and moved from one wing tip to the other with great speed and maneuverability. I searched the sky the following nights to make sure that this was not a star constellation and the 3 lights were not there. The object moved slowly in the South-West direction."],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2011 09:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"31374","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Latitude":"35.524741","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[],"Summary":"Boomerang UFO with small UFO's near it","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.524741,+-86.578947(31374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31374) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31374.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31374.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/01/2011 04:03 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
