It looked like it was flying in the culver city area. Last night around 1:15am I was cleaning my apt and looked out the window and saw the exact same aircraft again. It would fly from end to end faster than any helicopter or plane. It would ascend very high and then swoop really low and disappear, the reappear in another side of the sky. At times it looked like a disc with a row of blue green lights, then when it would fly higher and higher, it would only show a reddish orange light. The thing about it, was that it kept flying in the same pattern. I had never seen anything fly, disappear and reappear the way that thing did. I ended up driving towards it in culver city, and of course couldn't see anything. I know that other people who were driving or were out in the city saw it too."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Culver City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
