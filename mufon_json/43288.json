I did not take note of the time but the Orion Constilation was just over the east horizon (and my mother stated it was at about 10:30pm). The Object Flew from east to west at what I would call a high rate of speed. It was silent (I know this as I live about 3 miles from an airport and 1 mile from a military base from which there where no sounds of planes at that moment which is strange in itself as the phoenix airport always has planes up in the air.) I did take note of this. The object Had a light blueish white glow around it and I could not tell what shape it was but if I had to guess it was longer then wide. The object had no blinking lights like a traditional aircraft would. I would say it was about the size of a USD nickle. Had to have been flying lower then a cargo jet at which you can hear those fly over. It flew from the east to west horizon in about 1 min."]}
