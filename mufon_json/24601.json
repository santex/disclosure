{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhen I went to bed at night to sleep in about 20 seconds I rolled over. As I was rolling over I saw outside my window a very beautiful object traveling eastward at about 1 mph. It was just above the carports. It looked like an outline of a concoction of boxes. Like boxes that were piled up where you can only see the outline of them. Each corner had a different colored Xmas tree type light. The lights blinked randomly. The center of the object looked like bubble glass where there was white light inside. In the center of the glass was a perfect cross. I could not determine the material of the cross. Other than the lighted glass the face of it could not be seen. The object seemed to have arguing going on inside. Just something I sensed, and not heard. I lost sight of the object when it went out of my view behind my window. This sighting happened so many years ago. I do not even remember the year. I believe I was accurate in describing it."],"Object Shape":"Other","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Case Number":"24601","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24601.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24601.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/10/1991 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-117.906374","Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 09:53 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There were no other sightings in Anaheim on or around October 10th 1991"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07172010-0025","Summary":"Beautiful concoction just outside my bedroom window.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.844913","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.844913,+-117.906374(24601)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24601) map </A>","City":"Anaheim"}
