I looked outside the window and saw an orange sphere traveling in a south westerly direction across the sky. I went outside and saw more orange spheres traveling in the same direction but not on the same flightpath. In about a period of 30 minutes I must have seen about 30 orange spheres .(Approximately about 1 sphere a minute). They were about 1000 feet high , very bright , traveling about the speed of an propellar aircraft. There was no noise at all coming from the spheres. I look at them through binoculars. I called all my family to view the spheres and my brother took some photos of them. They were definately NOT a firework , Chinese Lantern , Balloon or an aircraft. I and my family have never seen anything like this before."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"GB-01012010-0006","City":"Northampton","Case Number":"21295","Object Features":"None","Region":"Massachusetts","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.33167","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.637771","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Northampton","There were no other sightings in Northampton on or around January 1st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/01/2010 09:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.33167,+-72.637771(21295)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21295) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
