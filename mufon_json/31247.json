It started at the swimming pool,when people like me in water or around the swimming pool looked up when helicopters belonging to the french \"gendarmerie\" went to and fro above the glass roof.Shortly after,as I was out at the poll's exit, one helicopter was just above the canal in front of the s.pool, in the same position (not moving) above the water.Until that time I had thought of a car accident or trouble with a gang etc.(The helicopters were 2 or 3 at least).Then I started going home...shortly after, still hearing and seeing the helicopters, I was going home,on foot.Shortly after I entered my street I heard a helicopter on my left, looked at it and saw, just at its right and behind, a small round disc or sphere going rather slowly,very regular.It was going at times in front of the blue sky and at others in front of white clouds,which gave me a feeling that this object was small and not very far from me,althought it is difficult to tell...I walk home during a bit more than 10 minutes,looking at the strange object untill it approached the horizon,almost (above the distant houses and other buildings),it went on a straight line from beginning to the end,never changed its direction,as it seemed.At the beginning of the observation it seemed that it went clearer on the top,I thought it was due to sunlight. The important question I put to myself was: What were doing the helicopters in the sky? Was it coincidence?Were they trying to find something they could have found on their radars? If only I could give an answer!!!!! This is very serious t���moignage,I wish I could find somebody who saw this object that day!I remember I crossed somebody and I almost stopped him but I hesitated,what a mistake!!!!"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Calais","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Nord-Pas-de-Calais","Longitude":"1.866275","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"small black disc or sphere,silent with regular path,","Date Submitted":"08/28/2011 01:14 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/24/2009 03:30 UTC"}
