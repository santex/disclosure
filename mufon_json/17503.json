I saw one shooting star and as I was looking at a patch of sky in the opposite direction, a \"star\" I was looking at grew extremely bright (10-20X brighter than Venus) and then faded quickly and \"went out\". I suppose it could have been a meteor that I was seeing head on (as it did not streak or move as normal shooting stars do). The only natural phenomenon I have ever seen that was that bright was a fireball meteor, but this just looked like a \"star on steroids\" for approximately 3-5 seconds. I believe I was facing NE at the time. If you saw what I saw, or maybe got a better glimpse, please let me know! P.S. I am an amateur astonomer and avid UFO hunter. I know what shooting stars look like, I live in the city, so I know the flight paths of incoming aircraft, and I know where all the planets are. This was a \"UFO\" in the purest sense of the term."],"Summary":"Star-gazing on a clear night. A particular star I was looking at glowed VERY bright, and then disappeared.","Latitude":"43.098674","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","City":"Fairport"}
