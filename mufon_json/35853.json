It only lasted about 5-10 seconds max but it was a bright blue light streaking across the sky and just befor it disapeared there was a bright white flash on its tail the it was gone. I have seen a meteorite come into the atmospher and burn up befor, that was a bright red fire ball with a redish yellow flash upon disintigration. This acted the same but the colors were all wrong. Did anyone else see this besides me? Call me and I'll tell ya about the fireball (meteorite?)because i could never find anyone who would admit to seeing it either. that was in 2007 I think."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.5628","Date Submitted":"02/16/2012 07:25 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"35853","Summary":"looked like a meteorite but, do they look like a bright blue light that flashes white for a couple seconds befor disapearing?","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35853.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35853.html"],"Latitude":"42.640335","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Delhi Charter Township","There were no other sightings in Delhi Charter Township on or around February 14th 2012"]}
