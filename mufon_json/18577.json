I am an international long haul Boeing 777 airline pilot, so I understand airplane lights and I am also familiar with atmospheric phenomena. I have flown all over the world and am familiar with the night sky. I am also a qualified microbiologist with a master's degree. In a nutshell, what I am trying to say is that if something unusual catches my eye, I analyze it carefully and eventually am able to classify it rationally. A bright red almost orange red light caught my eye far off in the NE sky. It was moving in an easterly direction. It seemed rather unusual, and I tried my best to look for other lights like a green right wing tip light that would help me identify it as an airplane. There was no apparent engine noise, but that may be because it was far away. It moved about through many different directions and all this time I was able to assure myself that there were definitely no other lights, only one red-orange light. I called my wife and two boys (12 and 6) who also watched the event with me. We watched it for at least 30 minutes from the time I first noticed it. I tried to film it with my video camera, but could not capture it? Through my binoculars, it had definite solid spherical qualities like a solid red ball. It did not flicker and glow like a flare. At times it almost appeared to have a red spike protruding below it? Suddenly, a second smaller ball of the same color appeared to either fall from it or fly from it. It went straight down towards the ground very slowly directly beneath the first ball of light until we lost sight of it on the horizon. The first ball of light then appeared to gain altitude smoothly and reversed direction heading NW. We continued to observe it and then noticed what appeared to be a faint bluish- whitish dim light appear to be on an intercept path beneath it. We lost sight of this second very dim light. Suddenly there was a split second intensely bright white flash some distance beneath the first orange ball. The orange ball appeared to flicker? A few seconds passed and I saw a second bright white flash and then without warning the orange ball flickered and disappeared. I could not tell if it dematerialized or disintegrated or simply shot off so fast that I could not see it, but one second it was there and then the next it was gone. The whole thing has left me slightly confused and irritated. I am not one who thinks every light in the sky is a UFO, but I did feel that this observation was unusual and significant enough to report. Could it be a flare, I do not think so. Was it an airplane, definitely NOT! Maybe someone else also observed the same thing?"],"Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Queen Creek","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
