Looked directly up and saw object come from behind cloud into clear sky, then fly directly behind another cloud which blocked it completely. Very clear details of rounded triangle shape, bright metallic gold color, and misty white glow from center of triangle shape. Appeared to be moving at speed approximately twice as fast as previously viewed Lear jets leaving nearby airport. Watched for several minutes, but did not see object come from behind clouds in any direction. I was somewhat ecstatic to finally have clearly seen an object that I could not explain by any other means other than as an intelligently piloted, non-military craft. I would have liked to get a video or still-frame, but the sighting was less than 10 seconds in duration."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.608985","Log Number":"US-07262013-0011","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Kennesaw","There were no other sightings in Kennesaw on or around July 26th 2013"],"Case Number":"49201","Summary":"Short flyover of triangular gold craft with whitish glow in center.","Latitude":"34.02531","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.02531,+-84.608985(49201)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49201) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49201.html"]}
