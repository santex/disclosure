It didn't appear to be reflective but was lit up a bt because of the moon on it. I think it might be a warship, here from another planet to assess our capitol. I only noticed it when my wife saw it and her mouth fell open. I only lost sight of it as it started getting smaller, i think heading towards lafayette square. I thought it was just something like that thing how those people said their kid was in it, starting a manhunt but i knew it wasn't from ameica when it lit up on the back and started moving. I felt pretty freaked about it when it was gone."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"went over our apartment at 5-10m. an hour, after hanging in one place","Latitude":"41.299184","Weather Factors":"Windy","Tags":"City","Case Number":"21015","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Cone, Cylinder, Diamond, Teardrop","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.299184,+-91.692945(21015)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21015) map </A>","City":"Washington"}
