I was looking towards the south admiring the thunder clouds in the distance. I noticed a bright white object that I thought was a shooting star. It came down out of the clouds towards me then stopped in slow motion and then accelerated south at a unbelieveable speed and disapeered out of sight to the south away from me. This object looked like it had sparks melting off of it. (Does that sound crazy?) The path it traveled is best discribed as the shape of a check mark with a long disapeering tail. I've seen lots of shooting stars, but I have never seen one stop and change directions and take off again."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15349.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15349.html"]}
