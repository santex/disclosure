The second time we saw it I grabbed my camcorder and shot this video. You will see the UFO come into frame after you see the commercial airliner come into view. I followed it as long as I could before I lost it. The ufo took the same flight path as it did the 1st time. We were looking straight south from our deck and the UFO is seen heading in a north-east direction and then seems to stop and climb out of our sight. This happened both times and there was no sound. We thought it could have been a dark colored balloon but, thought it was odd that we saw one and then another one 10 minutes later taking the same flight path. Maybe you can help. There is little to no wind tonight also. No wind was visible at the treetops."]}
