I was watching my line to make sure it was tight. That's when the horizon caught my view. Looking south over the lake, I seem a very thin profile of something in the air. It had a steady burning red light in front and a pulsating red light in rear. It was very low. And ungodly long. I lived by airbase in Jacksonville for almost my whole life. I've seen every kind of plane they have. I have never seen anything this long and slender. Not sure what it actually is. Just thought I should tell someone. But that reminds me. Maybe an hour earlier there was so phantom waves. No boats in the area but had really big wake against my dock. Not had an experience like that since I was very young where I grew up in Pascagoula ms."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-92.392214","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mayflower","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Date of the Event":"06/13/2013 09:15 UTC","Region":"Arkansas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"34.99185","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Mayflower","Country":"United States","Summary":"From my point of view look to be half inch above tree line with arm all the way out using fingers.
