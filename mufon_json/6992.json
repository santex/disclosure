there was no sound and there were no navigation or marker lights, and helicopters probably wouldn���t be glowing orange. after seeing the three lights in position for no more than 10 seconds total, the two orange lights began moving to the left, relative to the white point star which did not move. the few other white point stars visible did not move either (the ship was not turning.) over a total period of around 30 seconds that these orange lights moved, the top one moved roughly horizontally to a position roughly 45 degrees to the front of the ship. during that movement it did dip slightly in apparent altitude when it was about 90 degrees off the side of the ship. the other light also moved at the same time as the first but its movement was independent of the first. it first moved slightly dow and to the left, then rose slightly and then continued horizontally to the left. when it was almost 90 degrees to the side of the ship it dipped slightly and then rose to the same height as the first light. it ���followed��� the first light for a second of two and then dropped slightly, all the while moving to the left. when these lights both reached the position approximately 45 degrees to the front of the ship they both faded out and i lost further sight of them. to reiterate, i could not tell the exact atmospheric conditions during this sighting but there were maybe 25 visible stars in my field of vision. these were white points of light that did not move relative to the ship or to each other during the time i saw the orange lights, which did move both relative to the visible stars and to each other. although they did move together and at the same time, the movement of the orange lights varied in speed and in altitude relative to each other, the other visible stars and to the horizon. they were stationary for about 10 seconds and moved for about 30 seconds before disappearing. the lower of the two lights moved a greater distance than the top one and therefore moved faster as they both started moving at the same time and disappeared from view at the same time with about the same distance separation."]}
