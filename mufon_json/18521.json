I had the pleasure of being the passenger for a change. We were driving through Washoe Valley when I looked up to the clouds and saw a white cylinder object flying straight north to south very fast. I saw no tail part, no wings nor shadows of wings or reflections. Just white. Then it went off into the distance into a cloud. Over 30 minutes I saw three of these things, identical, featureless and flying in the same direction through the clouds. The clouds were fairly thick so I have no idea if there were more of them. That's it folks!"],"Date of the Event":"08/06/2009 12:00 UTC"}
