Wasn't sure what it was so i began recording it. During the filming i noticed four sets of lights. It was diamond shape, with lights at the front, sides and rear of the craft. It was totally silent. It did not have the same light patterns of the airplanes that fly over at night. All lights seemed to be the same color (bright white), the lights on the sides, were blinking. Totally differant from an airplane, which has diffreant color lights on the wings. i ended up losing it because i could not see it anymore. This is not the first time i have seen this craft in the Austin skies. I keep wondering what it could be."],"Longitude":"-97.738061"}
