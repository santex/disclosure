{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting Detailsit happened again last night, as the night previous, which i have also reported to you. it was in the same place in the sky this time an hour earlier. just to the left and a little bit below of the big dipper in the NW sky. it did not move as much this time, but just hovered slightly, and then it disappeared behind the trees in the same exact spot as the night before. this time i got out my binoculars and i could still not make it out completely because my hands were shaking. but it seemed to have a white center with red laser-like spokes radiating from it. and on the top it was green spokes. the lights pulsed in what seemed to be a circular way. 2 other similiar objects then followed in a straight line towards where the other object had gone behind the tree. the same thing happened the night before. i tried to get my telescope to work but could not. and unfortunately my video camera is broken. what a time for it to break. i'll be watching again tonight."],"Object Shape":"Disc, Other, Unknown","Summary":"red green pulsating light","Latitude":"45.386991","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-93.35976","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25741","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/08/2010 09:17 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","City":"St Francis","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in St Francis","There was one other sighting in St Francis on or around October 7th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/07/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25741.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10082010-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.386991,+-93.35976(25741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25741) map </A>","Region":"Minnesota"}
