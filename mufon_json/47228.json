Early A.M.","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-154.94772","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out in the Puna area near Pahoa, Big Island of Hawaii. It was January 26th when we headed out to view the lava flow (fire goddess Pele)we made offerings to Pele and meditated on the hot lava field for awhile. On out trek back, in the early morning of the 27th my friend pointed across the horizon of the sky to a saucer-type object that was hovering about above Mauna Loa. It did not move a whole lot but maybe from side to side and up and down in the radius of no more than 200-400 feet. It seemed as though whom-ever it was came to view the flow on the first full moon as well we were convinced. We watched it for 15 minutes or so, then continued on, we noticed it was still there in the same area about a half an house later as we walked on and forgot about it some. It was brightly lit, and definitely not acting as any known aircraft. It was not a plane. We felt a changed sense of consciousness and that we were being watched or observed, as if this craft was surveying the whole area. We did not feel in danger. It was a remarkable cap on an extraordinary night."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.505333,+-154.94772(47228)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47228) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Dome","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47228.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47228.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/06/2013 09:09 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pāhoa","There were no other sightings in Pāhoa on or around January 27th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"19.505333","Date of the Event":"01/27/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"47228"}
