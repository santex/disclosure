{"Date of the Event":"03/15/1993 02:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis may have ben in march or possibly april of 92 or 93 I was laid off from work and It was a windy day. My children were young so I thought they would like to fly a kite. They were too small so I was flying the kite. The sky was clear blue with no clouds anyware. I was watching the kite and saw the the object off to the south of where the kite was. I looked at it and was blimp shaped but it was not the blimp that flys around by goodyear. It was much larger just a silvery color and seemed to be extremely high. The wind died down and the kite started to drop. I pulled in the kite, and the blimp was gone. Nothing was visible in the clear sky."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Blimp","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"6403","Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-81.580956","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"looking up at a kite I saw a large silvery blimp shape object I looked away and it was gone.","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Beach City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6403.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6403.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.653116,+-81.580956(6403)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6403) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/15/1993 02:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Beach City","There were no other sightings in Beach City on or around March 15th 1993"],"Log Number":"US-02182007-0002","Latitude":"40.653116","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
