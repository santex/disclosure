Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-118.322726","divs":["sighting detailsjuly 17th was at my house, and july 18th was at my boyfriends house- i wanted to report these two sightings, because both nights i saw similar objects, on the 17th a star like bright object to the east of me going south to north & the 18th, a high up, from the south to right above me then went to the north-west- but both nights each object was seen & either on the 17th-immediately suddenly being followed by almost silent helicopters & jets, & the 18th- as the object had juust past over head, to my right\\northish- suddenly jets came from the south west & a helicopter from south & the object went from light blue-white almost a light blueish-lavenderish to invisible- i have watched the skies for years at night, & seen a lot of crazy unexplainable things- and i live north of burbank airport, & a helicopter pad is on the mountain north east of me by the 210 freeway- so i see a lot of planes & helicopters all the time & know the difference between a known object & unknown one-- & i dont report everything i see, even the really crazy flashes of light, or fireball looking like things that look like they disintegrate, or the flash paths like someone streaked a glow stick thru the air that left a trail for a few seconds, or the very high up blue-ish white lit up\\glowing lil lines, they look like flying hyphens, and they move thru the sky very high up at high sppeds & change direction, speed, & dissapear or dim down randomly & will blink at u- there are a lot of flying \"lights\" n diff colors ive seen- red, white, blueish, orangish, redish , greenish- its odd- or a white star like obeject moving fast fly up to a \"star\" & stop in the place of the star as the \"star\" that had been sitting there for hours suddenly takes off north-- or a very big flash of yellow\\blueish light & a big yellow shape that is hard to explain that disappears suddenly- or the very quickly odd blinking lights that seem to blink at stars that blink the same way back as if i dunno, communicating or something- i know that sounds crazy but ive seen it hundreds of times the last 4 years- but when i see something that is being tracked, or followed by a few other known objects like jets & black (almost silent) helicopters, then its something being seen or acknowledged by people other than just me & my boyfriend- *** on the 17th- around 9pm- i was outside in my back yard playing with my dog- and w have big power lines over the horse pasture behind our house-& im always checking the skies when im outside- and notice stars seem to act or shine differently when something is going to happen or is happening-& i noticed the stars to the south east of me out of the corner of my eye then looked at them seeming odd- & then- it caught my eye-to the east, i saw a white bright star- moving from south to north-west- it slowed down, randomly, n would dim a bit, usually as it approached a star area, & then would brighten back up & speed up- & as soon as it got to the north more a bit east of me\\my position, it curved its path to north west- and over the mountain line below it flew out a helicopter going fast and followed below it- it was semi high up- where planes usually fly-and i could hear a helicopter coming from the west- as the star like object flew northwest it went out of my view, but then a jet flew out from south west in the direction it had flown- the helicopter below the object that had been following it, stayed with it as far as i could see- some other odd things happened that night- but this was the most acknowledged by helicopters & jets that i saw that night- on the 18th- around 9-930ish- i was sitting outside his house facing west, watching the sky- & a similar sight occurred- at my boyfriends house- he lives at the bottom of the suburban housing area in sunland- & his property is next to the lake view terrace\\hansen dam area- & close to the golf course there thats kinda off the 210 freeway- & next to mountains & protected forest area- & we have seen a lot of random odd things in the sky there before- some things that i had never even seen before at my own house- but last night a small hyphen\\dash like object high up in the sky, that was blueish-white- almost a light lavender-ish was moving from south east, up to right above me high up- & when it got close to stars they would either dim down a bit, or they would blink as it got close or they would jump around in place- i know it sounds crazy but it is hard to not see & ignore- & the object was moving from south east to north west then to straight north- it would slow down when it got near sum stars, then speed up- and as it got to my right- north almost to the mountain top edge high above it- it suddenly just dimmed down & was not visible anymore- but when it had reached right directly above me- a fast moving plane came from south west- & suddenly a helicopter was coming from the south east- and as they got closer to me from the south both heading directly where the dash-obejct was- it when it started dimming- slowly & after it passed over he big dipper handle middle star- it dimmed out completely & i couldn't see it- for a lil while i could barely see a difference in the sky around it that it had gotten as it began to dim & could follow it kinda with my eyes seeing only this odd surrounding change in the sky & a slight trail- then it was gone- i just couldn't see it anymore- but the plane\\jet flew straight where it had been & then over the mountain- as did the helicopter- i also go online & check the satellite projection sights & times to make sure it wasn't just a satellite you can see float across the sky- but last i checked, satellites do not slow down & speed up, or dim & brighten randomly or change direction- & im pretty sure helicopters & jets wouldn't be flying out to follow a satellite- but i found online that both nights, there were no visible satellites at those times in those locations or traveling in the same direction path that the two objects i've reported were seen- there is a picture attached from the night of the 17th- on my way home- this odd bright light floating through the sky that i saw from the freeway & when i got off at the exit to the stop light- had moved north west from where id seen it originally- & it looks a lot like the starlike object i saw moving later that night on the 17th- i cropped it to be able to see it better- taken from my iphone out my window- at the exit up the main blvd from my house- *** there have been many times i have seen something fly in the sky or go across it, & then have seen helicopters & jets fly out to where it was & follow the direction it took- but usually always right after it dims out or has flown out of sight- but seeing two nights in a row- things following something odd so close to it- i thought id at least report it- i have tried to video tape these events with my iphone before & always can barely even see any stars show up in the footage-i don't know how to get a zoom that can pick up & record the flying lights- but over the years i have had friends see things with me- & over the past few months have been happy to have my boyfriend finally watch with me & witness these kind of strange events & sights- & that always helps to confirm ur not seeing things that aren't there- even tho i've had numerous friends & my brother & mother see things with me, flying or streaking thru the sky- or just stars moving around a lot that defy what u think we all know- so ive had confirmation i'm not just seeing a weird optical illusion or anything- i am working on finding a recording device that can capture these strange flying \"lights\\stars\\dashes\" to provide visual evidence"],"Summary":"July 17 & 18th- a star like object & a high up lit up \"dash\" moving thru sky & blinking at other stars, followed by helicopters &
