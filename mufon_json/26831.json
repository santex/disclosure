I was out back, I had just gotten home from work went outside to smoke when I saw this very very bright white light off in the distance, I thought maybe it was a plane coming right towards me to give it the bright light effect or maybe a helicopter but after watching it for 10 minutes it wasn't getting any closer. I opened the door to yell into my parents to come look at this. By the time I turned back around it was gone, nowhere to be seen. My mother then goes on to tell me what about 2 hours ago she was in the driveway and saw a bright white light. She went into the house to go to the porch area to get a better look at it and by the time she got out back the light was gone. She had not discussed this with me before I saw the light I saw. Very odd."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26831.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26831.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-99.731524","Case Number":"26831","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"12/02/2010 10:42 UTC","Latitude":"32.456416","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-12022010-0019","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Summary":"Very Bright White Light","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.456416,+-99.731524(26831)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26831) map </A>","City":"Abilene","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were no other sightings in Abilene on or around December 2nd 2010"],"Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"12/02/2010 09:27 UTC"}
