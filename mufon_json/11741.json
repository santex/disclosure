I started spacing off and noticed some orange lights in the sky. They didn't really register with me until my friend noticed them and said they were going out, moving, and fading back in (staying stationary while lit). This brought it to my attention immediately, and we began to look at the sky for more strangeness. About five minutes later, a light shows up ahead of us. I thought it was the tower up ahead, until it faded out and lit back up in a location directly to the left. We counted it doing this six times, and didn't see it any more that night. Honestly, I believe there have to be aliens, but I'm not stir crazy about it, and will try to explain it away as this, that, or the other. I couldn't explain this. The lights were stationary while lit, and as soon as they faded away, another one lit up in another location near it."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.490036,+-87.516964(11741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11741) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ambia","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"07/23/2008 10:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11741.html"],"Sighting Duration":"10:00:00","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Latitude":"40.490036","Case Number":"11741","Date of the Event":"07/23/2008 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-87.516964","Tags":"City","City":"Ambia","Summary":"Stationary orange lights fading out and reappearing in another location","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply"}
