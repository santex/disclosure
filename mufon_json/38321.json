{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-73.112232","Log Number":"US-05212012-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving along Veterans Memorial Highway when I saw about 8 strongly glowing orange orbs in the sky. I am used to seeing planes fly over in to Islip but these were higher than the planes in the usually flight path to land and were moving in all kinds of directions at a high rate of speed for their distance and altitude. Some were brighter than the others and all same blinking lights. I had never seen anything like it. It caught my attention right away because it looked so different than the usual planes in the area. Some other people stopped to look on as well. I looked online and there were the same orange orbs reported in Brooklyn the same night."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"About 8 very bright orange orbs that also had blinking triangular lights moving around Long Island sky near Islip airport.","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/21/2012 12:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.778975,+-73.112232(38321)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38321) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/20/2012 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.778975","Country":"United States","City":"Bohemia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38321.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38321.html"],"Case Number":"38321","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Bohemia","There were 5 other sightings in Bohemia on or around May 20th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New York"}
