{"Date of the Event":"09/25/2008 07:55 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsIntensely bright unwinking light, moving at the speed and height of a commercial plane, heading east over Aldermaston, the UK's nuclear weapons research facility fifteen miles away and on towards London and Heathrow Airport - fifty miles away. The early night sky is full of planes at this hour, to and from London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, with five or six planes' winking navigation lights visible in the dark sky at any one time. This light was an incandescent white light, larger and brighter than the many stars, and travelled at speed cross the sky. Through binoculars it sometimes had the appearance of a V-shape, and sometimes a crescent. It was high and silent, with no flashes of light, only a strong, steady brilliant white light, silently crossing the evening sky, on a different flight path to the many planes in the sky at this time."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"GB-09252008-0004","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"12772","Longitude":"-70.844343","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.768347","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12772.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12772.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.768347,+-70.844343(12772)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12772) map </A>","City":"Newbury","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Newbury","There were no other sightings in Newbury on or around September 25th 2008"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/25/2008 07:55 UTC","Summary":"Bright unwinking light, moving at the speed and height of a commercial plane","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Massachusetts"}
