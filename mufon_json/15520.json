I tried to wake up my husband and he would not get up. This thing looked like it flew even lower and was coming down the street towards towards my house. I was too scared to get up so I layed there and hoped it was gone. It had to be close because light filtered into my room. At first I thought it was a helicopter but there was no noise and it was way to bright with a bluish light. I fell asleep right after that I think and then I woke up again at about 4:30 and things seemed normal so I went to the bathroom. What was it? Anyone else see it?"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15520.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15520.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/01/2009 03:15 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.329243,+-75.78219(15520)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15520) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/01/2009 03:15 UTC"}
