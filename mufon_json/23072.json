{"Log Number":"US-05012010-0012","Summary":"(4) Disc shaped, hovering, glowing UFO's, 5 Reptile (Intelligent Snake-Aliens)","divs":["sighting detailsfrom a child really, it's weird and confuseing, sometimes i think i am a alien hybrid or something. this particular sighting\\meeting was spurred from a event that occured in approx: 1995 or 1996, i was driveing from the east coast to california, in the arizona area within a 100 miles of the eastern state-line, on i-10. it was night, with a full-moon. i was not all that tired, as i had slept most of the day at a motel a couple hundred miles back east. of a sudden i had this over-whelming \"influence\" to stop on the side of the interstae in an area of the high-mesa's. i did. there was one particular mesa, that kept drawing my attention, lights began circleing it, somehow i was impressed with the idea that a mother ship was buried\\hidden somehow within. although not tired, i feel into a deep, strange sleep, with many odd and strange looking creatures commuteing with me, as if in a deep sleep, yet seeing, yet awake. all these things i saw and heard (mother ship hidden within the mountain, and odd snake-like aliens communeing, yet not speaking sounds, i could understand \"most\" of what they were saying.)in this wide-awake, yet deep-sleep state. (though i never was asleep). now, this stuck in my mind, (whereas dreams fade rather quickly, this never did, but like i said i had prior experiences to this.), so, in about 2006 or so i believe it was (i came back from hawaii in 2003, lived in ocean side ca. a few years, went around the phoenix area looking for cheaper land-house deals, and once there, it all became \"over-whelming\" again.), i purchased tent, sleeping bag, camping supply stuff, and determined to trek out into the desert, and camp out awhile by the \"hidden in the mountain ages old mother-ship\", this turned into a several month camping trip for me. for a long time, nothing unusual. then, at last, one night as i was prepareing to sleep, that \"odd feeling\" overwhelmed me again, i looked out from my tent (it was summer, and both scorpions and snakes roam at night, scorpions are not very friendly, unless a coyote pack befriends you to keep them off as scorpions avoid their fur-oils, and snakes avoid humans if they can, so i mostly stayed in the tent except daylight hours). that odd-drawing feeling, 4 glowing, saucer shaped ufo's appeared, sometimes hovering, sometimes coming closer to me, sometimes farther away, after a bit, these odd snake-like aliens came around and communed, again, they remembered me from before, and before that, though they were'nt the exact same ones as beforetimes, they knew me from the others of their kind, that i had met before somehow, and they knew all that had transpired in past events i had with others of their kind. though they made hiss-like sounds i could not understand, i could understand most of what they said., this time they had what looked like wild-ferral hogs with them (common for the area), yet they also could speak with me, yet not with words, but i understood most of what they said., and the intelligence in the eyes of these was astounding, not like hog eyes, much more-so than human eyes., i followed them into the desert most of the night, they wanted to show me a thing, fiannly we came to several cows that had escaped a fence and were wandering free., of a sudden one of the glowing ufo's (which had remained behind over my camp in the desert area)came up so fast that it seemed to almost just \"appear\" (these ufo's made no sound my ears could detect, and i hear much better than most)and they moved fast. a yellowish orange blue glow came from it, one of the cows shook, mooed once, and fell over on its side. other aliens came up to it, the cow swelled up like it had been dead and bloated for days or weeks, they used strange devices, and light devices on it, somehow it was cut open in areas, i asked if they were going to eat the cow, they said they were recovering something that had been growing in the cow, that they had implanted there some-time back. (again i could'nt understand everything they commuted to me.) either i could'nt understand, or (i think) they would'nt tell me exactly what and why they were growing things in such ways in cows, diseases kept coming to mind though, strange, new diseases to affect most humans in odd new ways, but i suspect they tried (and mostly did) to keep the full matter from me.... like i said, that was one of many times since i was a small child, i have had encounters. i have seen much more horrible things from these aliens than killing and cutting up a cow.(though never directed at me.) i had the distinct impression that they were going to send me a bunch of gold, money, win the california lotto, or something of value, to purchase a large tract of land, so that they could come\\go\\live in relative peace there on,with me sorta \"owning the land\" and keeping them safe, unseen and secure. that has not occured yet, unless someone stole it when they brought it to me when i was asleep in the tent in the desert, or some other time, someone stole it. which would not be wise at all for human-kind. well, i'm tired of writing for now, theres much more, but i'm tired of writing for now. -jim"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Object Features":"Dome","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"01/15/2006 10:20 UTC","Latitude":"33.456647","Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/01/2010 04:50 UTC","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","Case Number":"23072","Disposition":"Hoax","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23072.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23072.html"],"City":"Phoenix","Longitude":"-112.066277","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456647,+-112.066277(23072)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23072) map </A>","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around January 15th 2006"],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States"}
