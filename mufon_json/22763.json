There were two air crafts in the sky, seemed to be triangle shaped, extremely low flying, they seemed quite small maybe three-four feet across. They would touch one another and then shoot apart and touch each other again. It appeared to be a game of leap frog. Both crafts had white, blue, and red lights on them. We were not sure what the objects were, they appeared to be large kites, but kites cannot move the way they maneuvered. The driver refused to stop to allow us to get a better look at them; we saw them for about four to five minutes, long enough to know they were not kites. We lost sight of them quickly because we were moving."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-83.282667","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22763.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22763.html"],"Latitude":"42.646782","Disposition":"Unknown"}
