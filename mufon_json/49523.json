Called girlfriend and roommate both witness. Diving, Swooping. not possible manuvers seen by all.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside to let the dog out, and noticed a technicolor orb in the sky just above the horizon. Diving, swooping, all at tremendous speed. I took note as I have seen things of this sort at this part in the sky before. I went inside to see if my girlfriend would witness. Side note my girlfriend is not interested at all at this point. So I show her and she starts getting uncomfortable. So she goes inside and gets my roommate to see if he can see it. He does as well. All this time this thing is diving, swooping, and changing colors. All watch it for quite awhile until we get sufficiently freaked out and go inside. We sit inside talk for a couple minutes. We wonder if the thing is still out there. Go in the back and it's gone. Total time about 25 minutes from first observation."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/06/2013 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-08062013-0006","Region":"New York","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Utica","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Utica","There were no other sightings in Utica on or around August 6th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Other"}
