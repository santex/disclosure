When I leave the house am facing east. I immediately saw several orange lights at various heights above the horizon moving in my direction. They were separated from each other and as I watched more would move into view. I took them to be a group of helicopters but never heard a sound. Rather then continuing on over head they eventually moved to the north and soon after that the lights were not visible. This happened well short of the horizon. Guessing in all there was around 8-10 of these over the course of 5-10 minutes. At the closest the best way I can describe it would be like a road flare seen off in the distant with more of a floating action then a direct flight like an airplane would have. I didn`t notice any planes in the night sky until after I lost sight of the last one but likely there was. One was flying over at that point from the southwest to the northeast."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/26/2011 07:11 UTC","Latitude":"43.175248","Case Number":"33616","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Date of the Event":"11/25/2011 07:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Unknown"}
