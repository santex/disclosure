Back than it was acres of lands and forest of oranges trees. I was around 13-14 year of age now I���m 26. I never thought in my life I would get the chance to see what i have seen that night. I have seen ufos on TV and books but never this close and the feeling of that night still in my mine to this day. I told family members but they don���t believe me. I don���t really care if they don���t because I know what I saw. I���m happy that it was me. If I could go back in time to that night I would have woke up somebody like my mom and maybe just maybe people would believe me. It happen like this... I don���t remember the exact day or year but I think it was (June of 1995). I remember it was a warm night around 2am. The first thing that i heard was a loud noise high pitch sounds (like a earthquake) with a high pitch. I thought it was an earthquake cause it did the same effect like in the movies. pics on the wall was moving and the floor was shaking. But something was different about this suddenly it stop. I felt light somehow something I my head tells me that there something over the house. I didn���t worry too much because that wake me up and I needed to pee. The sounds lasted about a min not long so I woke up and started my way to the bathroom which was about 8 feet way around the comer. As I was taking a piss I heard a scratching sound coming from outside the bathroom window there was a tree about 3 stories high and the ufo had scratched the bottom of its ship to the tip of the tree branches. That caught my attention I look up and there it was a disc like shape ufo. The ufo had a light at the top and several lights on the side there was no sounds (nothing period) coming from it. The thing was flowing in mid air and moving at 1-3 mph and what���s special about this was. It was searching for something. I don���t know what but I know it was searching for something because there was an extra light on the bottom of the ship and it was moving. As the light on the bottom was moving I notice that there was spot light on the ground as big as the ufo when the light(bottom) of the ship was moving the spot light on the ground was moving also. So I know that it was searching and not just flying by. There was no light beam coming from the ufo at all I remember for sure this was the most amazing thing I ever saw in my life. This ufo was big about 30-35 ft wide. The thing that shock me the most was there was no sound coming from it as it was moving away at 1-3 mph. I watch it flow away and I told myself is this real did I just saw a ufo. I been watching sighting of ufos on TV and some are close to what I saw that night but the lights are different in a way that I don���t think it���s a real one. You can see the lights on the side of the ship. Well that���s my encounter with the ufo thanks for reading and I hope to see one more before I died."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21786.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21786.html"],"Longitude":"-119.700919","City":"Clovis","Latitude":"36.834188","Case Number":"21786","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Clovis","There were no other sightings in Clovis on or around June 1st 1995"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02062010-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/01/1995 02:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"This is real..No Dream.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
