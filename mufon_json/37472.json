As soon as I turned towards the southwest direction, I saw three very bright lights in the sky in the shape of a perfect triangle, all moving in complete unison. At first the lights remained stationary, as if they were hovering. I had no idea what it was because it was dark and I could not tell. I could not even tell if it was one object or three separate objects moving in unison. The lights were arranged in a triangle with two lights on top, and one light on the bottom in the middle. After about two minutes, the bottom middle light disappeared and the other two lights continued to move in perfect unison. After another couple minutes, they gained speed rapidly and moved south. After about one minute, I lost sight of them due to distance."],"Case Number":"37472","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
