I, myself, didnt know my way around the state and this would bea new experience. Ultimately it became a memory I wouldnt forget. That nightas we got near the city, a strange pattern of lights was floating off in thedistance. I noticed but said nothing. It wasnt until I noticed them again andrealized that they were behaving stranger than anything Id ever seen. To mysuprize no one else saw them until I pointed them out. They were the size of anextended fist out on the horizon. Thats when a noise, somewhat of a muffledbuzz, began and so did our car trouble. Our electric equipment alsomalfunctioned. Eventually the objects slowly, but surely dissappeared into thesky above us."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2142.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2142.html"],"Log Number":"","Date of the Event":"01/09/2003 04:27 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"2142","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Windy","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around January 9th 2003"],"Latitude":"32.228753","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Dome, Insignia, Other","Date Submitted":"01/09/2003 04:27 UTC"}
