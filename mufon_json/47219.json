Our bed faces out two windows. We both felt like we were nudged awake at 12:45am and saw a huge flash of light, that made our entire bedroom light up as if it was daylight. At first, we thought it might be lightning, so we waited for the thunder. Nothing happened. Immediately, after the flash of light, all of the electronics in our house started to flicker and then immediately turn off. We were without power for about 10+ minutes before everything turned back on. Some of our electronics, continued to malfunction after the fact. There was never any thunder and no other flashes were seen. We stayed up for about 2 more hours. Our child, whose bedroom is on the opposite side of the house, also witnessed it."],"Date Submitted":"05/06/2013 04:04 UTC","City":"Lake Elsinore","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.320842","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.671277,+-117.320842(47219)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47219) map </A>","Region":"California","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"05/06/2013 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.671277","Summary":"Bright Flash of Light before electronics failure"}
