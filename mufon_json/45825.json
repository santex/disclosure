{"Date of the Event":"02/21/2013 06:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe sun had just set and I was watching a movie on my pc when I noticed a bright star outside. I watched it (and it was a star, not a ufo) and felt compelled to go outside for some reason. I grabbed my camera and set it to night auto exposure before stepping outside. Then I took a step out, looked over behind my house and up in the sky, just above the treeline (the light was high in the sky but from my point of view, just above the trees) was a bright light. Twice as bright as any stars in the sky and it was moving from West to East at a good clip. I managed to film it for 2 minutes and 21 seconds before it disappeared behind some trees. I also filmed some planes a couple minutes later so you could see the difference. This light was bright white, moving faster than a plane, and had no sound. I unfortunately don't have internet in this 3rd world of a town and I am posting this from my phone but I will upload video of it saturday to youtube. Also you may contact me if you are from MUFON and need more info."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45825.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45825.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Orillia","There were no other sightings in Orillia on or around February 21st 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Ontario","Latitude":"44.6053","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"UFO near Orillia,Ontario caught on video","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.6053,+-79.413877(45825)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45825) map </A>","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-02212013-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.413877","City":"Orillia","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"45825","Date Submitted":"02/21/2013 11:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:21","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
