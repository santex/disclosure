Noticed 3 bright unusual lights over Tampa Bay that hadn't been there earlier in night or on other nights. My wife and I saw them while outside hotel so I went to room and filmed them from the balcony. Have no idea what they were. There is an airport nearby I believe but these lights stayed pretty much in one area above the bay most of the time (at least 30 minutes). I dont know if they could have been helicopters searching the bay but they didn't seem like that to us. I have attached a picture that came from the video I took. It is of one of the objects when it is orange. I have about 10 minutes of HD video of them, although it gets pretty shaky at times."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in St Petersberg","There were 2 other sightings in St Petersberg on or around March 10th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"27.669727","City":"St Petersberg","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/17/2012 03:01 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.669727,+-81.506614(38204)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38204) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.506614","Case Number":"38204","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38204.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38204.html"],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-05172012-0013"}
