Upon first spotting the object I was concerned that there had been an explosion, then when it streaked through the sky and was not accompinied by any sounds I realized my initial thought had been wrong and that I may have just spotted a U.F.O. and was left with a feeling of awe. I wished I could have seen more of it but that was impossible because of the speed in which it traveled."],"Summary":"An Explosion of Light","Log Number":"US-06262008-0003","Case Number":"11310","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York"}
