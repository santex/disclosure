I was actually looking to see if i could see another of these moving stars,i guess that is what i will call them because that is what they look like to me.The first time i saw something was a mnth or so ago my fiancee,my son and my daughter and i were having abonfire in our backyard and my daughter noticed the moving star and pointed it out to all of us.My fiancee and my son saw something another night that my son said was shaped like a line or a jellybean also moving and lighted,the other night i watched this moving star until it reached another star then i couldnt pick it up anymore.I don't know if these are ufo's or what i just know they do not resemble planes satelites or anything else?I have had several strange sometimes disturbing dreams over the years regarding our visitors from the sky so sometimes i wonder if its just my overactive imagination making a mountain out of a mole hill,this is where u come in.The objects have seemed to move silently smoothly and the first one was rather quick not lightning bolt fast but at a good steady pace,considering the dreams i've had its a little scary but i still have a curiosity and awe...one dream i had was actually so vivid i wrote down EVERYTHING,and actually drew pictures to descrbe where words failed so i have definately needed to get this off my chest...thank you"],"Date of the Event":"07/15/2008 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-64.966371"}
