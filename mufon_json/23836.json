The light went from east to west and it only took about a minute before it was out of my sight. I knew it wasn't a plane cause a plane doesn't have 3 lights that are in a shape of a triangle. But I tried looking for it again, but it just disappeared for the night."],"Longitude":"-63.566532","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.653481,+-63.566532(23836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23836) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/19/2010 12:00 UTC","Country":"Canada","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Halifax","There were no other sightings in Halifax on or around June 19th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON"}
