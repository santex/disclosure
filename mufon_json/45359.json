I ran inside to get my dad since he was a pilot his whole life and my children came out as well and my dad confirmed they were not planes after a few minutes he went inside to get out friends we had over and I was just trying to get a few pictures but they started disappearing into thin air. By the time he came back all a once they vanished just completely. I have a 2 second video and several images. I've seen sightings since it happened and many more images.
