{"Log Number":"US-07062008-0013","divs":["Sighting DetailsFive of us were walking down a road named Jean Anne off Jewell in Washington, MI, running East to West, looking out for fireworks, eyes to the sky. We were catching glimpses of these fireworks through trees and then we'd come to a clearing for a yard and get a good view but we were taking a walk, when I saw an object in the sky. There was no blinking, just two lights at first when I saw it moving from NE to SW, and it's size was about the size of an aspirin. The image I've included with this post looks like a saucer only because there was a separation of the light sources, they moved together, and the light intensity fanned out from the origin. As it got closer to us I could see that there was a gap of some kind between them, it got bigger so i could tell. As for altitude, I'd say it was twice as high as most fireworks in the sky at the time. We all watched it, and looked back and forth between that and a typical airplane with a red blinking light way up, blinking really slow."],"Longitude":"-83.036042","Date of the Event":"07/04/2008 11:15 UTC","Object Features":"Other","City":"Washington","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"11453","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:03:30","Date Submitted":"07/04/2008 11:15 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.724476,+-83.036042(11453)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11453) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"disc-like, white top, blue bottom","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11453.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11453.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around July 4th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"42.724476","Object Shape":"Disc"}
