We have noted Jupiter before and have never seen what we saw tonight. There was an object near Jupiter that was just as bright, but shaped almost like the arrow-style cursor on most computers. It sparkled and seemed to undulate back and forth. At times there would be a red light, then it would almost elongate to a straight line. There was occasional cloud cover, but the object still shined brightly through the clouds, almost like it was in the clouds. Other stars did not shine as brightly."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/16/2011 02:30 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.940291,+-82.276235(33374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33374) map </A>","Case Number":"33374","Latitude":"27.940291","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
