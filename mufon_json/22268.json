{"Case Number":"22268","divs":["sighting detailsi was leaning over the top of my car talking on the phone to a friend, when i saw a round silver shiny object come out of a cloud, leave its environment maybe twenty feet and then dart into another cloud, as if it realized it had left cover. there was no sound, not a humming or the whir of a classic motor. as i was talking on the phone out of boredom, i looked upward as the event happened. the clouds were about 100ft above ground (this is a 5' tall persons idea of height). the clouds were brilliant blue with a few large puffy clouds interspersed throughout the skyline. i know it sounds odd and lasted less than 60 seconds....but i know i am not hallucinating. what is truly weird, it was if i could see seams in the craft....were i too imagine it, first i would go with the '50's version of the inverted cup an saucer.......which my father and i saw in 1960 anchorage alaska, secondly, i would expect them to be so advanced it would not have seams. i knew exactly what i was seeing, a ufo...we don't have crafts like that in our military; my daughters are usaf & usarmy. i was so excited and let down at the same time. i look for the old fashion ''saucers'', so i was kinda disappointed it was a ball. buy i knew what i saw was not anything i have flown in. i told the friend i was talking to at the time, she scoffed at me then said she believed me...but i have learned in the course of our friendship, that is not necessarily true. once it left my vision, well, i have kept my eyes on the skies ever since, especially on semi-cloudy days...to no avail. i want to see more! so having seams was there anyone doing experiments? i have copied the info from my journal. to have made this up would take credence from my memory...a lie has no real life, this happened, whether i am believed or not, doesn't matter, i was there and i saw what i have reported here. i drew in my journal within minutes of the event, but i don't posses the ability to send it to you except in snail mail. you still want it? respectfully, \"c\" p.s., my father [cms\\tg\\pid] (deceased) told me the usaf would not waste it's resources to bring all those men to roswell for a weather balloon."],"Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-96.548599","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Window(s)","Latitude":"33.349001","City":"Anna","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22268.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22268.html"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Anna","There were no other sightings in Anna on or around July 19th 2006"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.349001,+-96.548599(22268)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22268) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03122010-0005","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"A silver ball","Date of the Event":"07/19/2006 04:21 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/12/2010 04:46 UTC"}
