It was about 5:30pm. A large jet with a dual condensation trail caught my attention above. I immediately noticed a brown reflective sphere near the jet. It hovered for a few seconds - enough time for me to shout to my roommate and say \"What is that thing near the jet!?\". My roommate also looked up and saw it. The sphere then began to descend at a sharp angle, almost like a projectile. We followed it with our eyes for about 30 seconds. We then lost track of it and could not find it again."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Region":"Tennessee","Latitude":"36.596802","Date Submitted":"03/10/2012 10:48 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Bristol","There were no other sightings in Bristol on or around March 10th 2012"],"Summary":"We saw a large jet leaving a double condensation trail.
