Travelling on Davis Road, I looked out of my window (front) and notice above the tree line a orange orb sitting there. It wasn't moving or doing anything strange. At first I thought it was a shop light from someones house until it started to pulse and then it seemed to change(in an explosive way) into a much larger orb. I've never seen anything so large in my life. At first I was amazed then a strong urge of fear set in. I was staring at it and a house got in my visual sight and when I passed the house it was gone."],"Region":"Washington","Object Shape":"Circle, Egg, Sphere","Summary":"Drive by sighting.","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around January 11th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.900122,+-77.029076(34805)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34805) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34805.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34805.html"],"Case Number":"34805","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
