It is hard to remove attchecd to the nearves and it olny causes paid if it is like struck or or some way hit but otherwise it is connected to my body and several dr's have not been able to idenify it. I have MRI'S, CAT SCANS, XRAYS and another study that I forget what type. I would like to have it removed not destroyed with a lazer removal device or other. Oh its NOT a Plnaters wart, its not a sist its unidenified. They have no idea what it is. It may be nothing but rater then destroy what mybe some sort of evidence for your group. I would volinter to have it removed by somone who can do it without damaging my foor. But I think it may be some sort of tag honestly I don't and Dr's don't know. Let me know if you can help or even if you can't. I do have insurance. I think I belive in UFO's but I would like to see some proof.
