Four times in the past seven nights 9pm and 10pm I observed an odd-looking flying object that moves in a bizarre fashion. For example, last night it was traveling fairly slowly from the south to north, stopped, then ascended in altitude, then it appeared to abruptly fall from the sky (landing in what appeared to be southwest of Rohrman Park. It has an orange glowing halo around it and looks like a lit hot air balloon, however, hot air balloons do not fly that high and I have never seen one that late at night. I just wanted to let you know since I would like to see a story about so I can eventually find out what it is. I live on Autumn Dr (in Schererville, but with a Crown Point address) and many of my neighbors have seen the same thing."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Fog, Light","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11629.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11629.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.45305","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.486325,+-87.45305(11629)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11629) map </A>","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Schererville","There were no other sightings in Schererville on or around June 17th 2008"],"Date of the Event":"06/17/2008 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07192008-0007","Latitude":"41.486325","Disposition":"IFO"}
