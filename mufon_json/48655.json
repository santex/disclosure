At first thought it could be firework - but realized it was moving in steady line and not extinguishing. Pulled over on road to get a better look. I watched it for about 30 seconds had no idea what it could be. Meteor? Comet? Flare attached to a balloon? I pulled back out onto the road and started driving again. I looked up and saw another one on same flight path as the first. I watched as it passed directly overhead. No sound, slowly moving - not very high up in the sky - glowing and orange."],"Case Number":"48655","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.422907,+-82.897893(48655)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48655) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48655.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48655.html"],"Log Number":"US-07052013-0030","Latitude":"40.422907","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 12:00 UTC"}
