Three of us were out working - it was still very light. My husband has great eyes and spotted a silver object in the southeast- it was very far away. Strangely, it would dim and then brighten to a very bright silver, and almost shine. I thought it must be a weather balloon, and clouds were forming to the north. My husband said it couldn't be, because it wasn't moving at all. We kept watching for about ten minutes, and it never moved, or changed, other than the slow, continuous pulsating. We could tell it was a solid, silver object, and appeared to be circular. It was very far away, over a mile, and probably several. As the clouds neared it, some light clouds went in front of it, which meant it was higher than that. Finally, after about ten -13 minutes, the clouds rolled over the object. I did not have my smart phone with me, but it was too far away to show much, anyway."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Oakdale","Log Number":"US-10152012-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43258.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43258.html"]}
