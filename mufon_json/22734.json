We were looking at stars when we saw a large triangle shaped glowing object with six glowing \"balls\" inside. It didn't make any noise and didn't move for about 15 seconds or so, then slowly went west until I couldn't see it anymore, that taking approximately 5 or 6 seconds. I had no idea what it was.
