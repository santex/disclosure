{"Log Number":"US-02242009-0024","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"15710","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball","divs":["sighting detailsi was on vacation last summer 2008 in the florida keys islamorada and it was one of those nights where i was out fishing with my mom's boss's husband and my little sister. normally my mom and his two daughters would tag along but that night the daughters wanted to watch a new episode of hannah montanna. john( won't say last name) is obsessed with fishing and i didn't want to go out that night because we had gone fishing every day that week and i was sick and tired of eating \" fish\" and catching fish. my mom said that my sister and i should go because it was supposed to rain for the next couple of days so we might as well go and get it over with. i hated taking the motion sickness pill and being out on the ocean so late with a grown man who panics a lot and my little sister who is 10 and very cranky about handling \" gooey fish\". it was like two in the morning and john was like \" oh we have almost reached our fishing limit\" and i was like thank god because i was getting tired as hell of listening to john's lame fishing techniques and lectures on how to be a \" good fisherman\" so i went towards the back of the boat where my sister was lying and staring out at the stars. that night i witnessed my first shooting star and boy was it beautiful!. i was gazing into the night sky in hopes of pointing out one to my little sister who teased that i was just \" seeing things\" when i saw a bright red\\orange orb like object hovering in the distance near the stars. i thought it was a plane at first but then i changed my mind because the object had remained stationary for quite some time. i went towards the front of the boat to ask john what he thought it was and he took one glance and was like \" ah, it's just a plane\". i kept my eyes on the object for quite some time and it still didn't move so i tapped john on the shoulder to let him know that the object hadn't moved so it couldn't possibly be a plane. he then said \" well, maybe it's a meteorite moving slowly or something.\" i didn't what to think but 15 minutes had passed and the red\\orange bright object was still there when i got done helping john clean up the boat of fish blood. it wasn't until we were leaving that the object took a sharp turn and vanished. i couldn't believe what i had witnessed. till this day i don't know what to think of that night. what the hell could that thing have been? i wonder if it was a moving meteorite or a forming star or something. i just remember the distinct color and orb-like appearance it had. i had completely forgotten that my little sister had tagged along with us for another boring fishing night so it didn't even cross my mind to ask her if she saw it. when i got home i ran upstairs to tell my mom what i had seen and all she could say was \" you and your sister are crazy\". my eyes widened when she said that because i had completely forgotten that my little sister came along. she had witnessed it too!!! i went to give my little sister a kiss good night that night and she was like \" i wonder what that thing in the sky was?\" i was like chelsea, i don't know but whatever it was, i'm glad you saw it too so i'm no fool."],"Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Islamorada","There were no other sightings in Islamorada on or around July 31st 2008"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"24.924294","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Islamorada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-80.627836","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15710.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15710.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"It appeared to be an orb fire- like figure","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=24.924294,+-80.627836(15710)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15710) map </A>"}
