Remember the red lights are most likely a plane but the white lights I do not know what they are. In the 2nd photo was one of the small blinking lights I saw. When I zoom in it looks like a small metal little triangle of some sort. I must of got a shot of it when it wasn't blinking out light. Thank you and hope you like the photos. The first photo I sent already with the two images of some sort is pretty wild huh? If you zoom in on it you can kinda make out a alien face? The one on the right anyways. It was really odd to me to capsure that on my camera."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Diamond, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28582.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28582_submitter_file1__100_0121.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28582_submitter_file2__100_0124.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28582_submitter_file3__100_0126.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28582.html"],"Longitude":"-122.543176","Latitude":"37.910707","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28582","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.910707,+-122.543176(28582)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28582) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08092011-0115","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Mill Valley","Disposition":"IFO"}
