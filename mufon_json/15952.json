A car was coming I was on the road so I turned to see if there was a car coming (I had ipod in) and in the car there was a bright object then a green object circular shaped came shooting down so fast towads Earth. The other bright light was now gone. I'm sure it was a UFO. I had a big adrenaline rush and ran home to tell my mother. She at first laughed but then accepted. I dont think she believes me but I saw a UFO I'm positive."]}
