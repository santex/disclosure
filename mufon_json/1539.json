{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the Verrazzano Bridge approaching the toll plaza - about 2,000 feet away - wesaw a round object hovering over the plaza - it looked like the Forum in L.A.,with windows shaped like arcs. It hovered for about 2 minutes, then the windowsexhibted white and red lights in series, and then it shot off to the north at agreat speed, and with with no noise. We asked several people at the plaza ifthey saw it - and none did.Years later, around 1970, I think, the Village Voiceran a front page article on a New Jersey UFO landing - the drawing for thearticle was very similar to the craft we saw. I emailed the Voice several timesto get a reprint, but they never responded."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.579532,+-74.150201(1539)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1539) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Window(s)","Region":"New York","Latitude":"40.579532","Summary":"OBSERVED UFO OVER VERREZZANO BRIDGE TOLL PLAZA","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"New York","Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"1539","Longitude":"-74.150201","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around November 30th 1963"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1539.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1539.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/30/1963 05:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/30/1963 05:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
