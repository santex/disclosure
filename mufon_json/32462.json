I notice something hovering over. It seem like it was by Liberty,MO, it was a little bigger than a helicopter with white bright beams of light on the bottom. At first I thought it was a UFO, then I looked again at the object and saw a red blinking light in the middle so I thought UFOs do not have red lights,so I just assumed it was a helicopter. Then I got off the highway and lost track of the object. Then I heard on the radio about the ufo sightings."],"Date Submitted":"10/08/2011 04:34 UTC"}
