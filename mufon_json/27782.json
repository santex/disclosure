At the peak of the streaming light, I noticed it was wider than the actual stream. Within approximately 1.5 seconds, it was all over, and the entire streaming light had disappeared. I immediately thought to myself, was that a flare? However, flares don���t disappear they burn as the light falls to the ground. This beaming light appeared to come from the ground up into the air a fast speed and disappeared rapidly. The area were the streak of light came from was partially wooded, however, these are the trees that separate 295 N and 295 S. Based on what I saw, it appeared that it may have been something moving so fast into the air, that it left a bright white streak and then it disapeared. This concludes what I saw at 10:15, 11 FEB 2011. To protect my identity, I have utilized dummy information; however, Im sure there are other means of figuring who I am. I wish to remain anonymous."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27782.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27782.html"],"Log Number":"US-02122011-0003","Tags":"City","Latitude":"37.435883","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.435883,+-78.651444(27782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27782) map </A>"}
