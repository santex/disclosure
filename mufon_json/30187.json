Larger than a star, probably about 4x the size of the north star. It seemed to be moving south which isn't typical of aircraft in this area and we didn't hear any sound like a plane would make. I confirmed with all 3 of us in the pool that we were all seeing it and that it didnt' seem like a plane. We have a large tree in our yard and when the light moved behind the tree out of view I got out of the pool to see what it was doing and it was gone. We were left wondering what it was and all confirming we did not think it was a plane. It moved south steadily and the size remained the same."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30187.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30187.html"],"Log Number":"US-07152011-0012"}
