I was not the first to see this event. I was sitting inside and my mother called out the family. She was smokeing and she sees 4 lights that are all flashing at the same time and that are about 10 degrees apart. These all moved at the same rate (about 10 degrees per second with one flash every second) We followed the lights from north west to south west. They suddenly stoped over the tree line and then stayed in place for a good minute. They then suddenly dropped out of sight behind tree line. About ten seconds after we got outside (15 seconds elapsed time from first sight to four members outside) we heard the roaring start. The roar continued for about 10 seconds after the objects sppeared. Aproximit elapsed time 3 minutes. All members saw same thing."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Fireball, Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Tawas City","Summary":"dot like","Date Submitted":"05/09/2012 11:42 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.280548,+-83.626851(38043)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38043) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States"}
