We looked to see where it was coming from. we looked up just above the treeline and saw the light coming from what I can only assume the center of the source. The source of light was circular in shape with smaller lights encircled around it. On the left and right hand side of the main light was an orange light which seemed indirect as in not aimed downward as opposed to the main light source. The main light source kept shooting the bright light down to the ground as if scanning (but not moving around). There was absolutely no sound from it. It came towards us for a split second, did an almost 180 degree turn then it was gone (High speed exit)."],"Date Submitted":"08/31/2008 02:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.22483","Longitude":"-71.32286","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change"}
