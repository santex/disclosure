Light was not from an aircraft. I live in Tampa air traffic pattern , and am a veteran of naval aviation. Object was traveling SSW as it disapeared leading me to believe it was losing altitude at a fast pace but was much to slow to be a meteor. Light was constant, did not flicker and left to \"tail\" as a meteor would.Also there was no sound. It seems to me all satellites from earth travel in a polar orbit or west to east or eliptical like ISS. I'm not familiar with any satellites that travel east to west, or am I mistaken?"],"Summary":"I saw a bright object at extreme huigh altitude as it disapeared in the shadow of the Earth","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-82.710235","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/09/2010 09:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.277996,+-82.710235(25775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25775) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/10/2010 10:36 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25775","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10102010-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Port Richey","There were no other sightings in Port Richey on or around October 9th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None"}
