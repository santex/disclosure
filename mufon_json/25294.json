Triangle of lights not bright. August 2010 full moon night. Very clear and limpid nuves. Aproximadamnte 10 at night in Stockholm between Gullmarsplan and Sk���rmanbrink sector. Suddenly appeared in the distance was not a ovjeto aircraft or Helicopters. Without any noise. It was moving forward very soft. It came much lower than the normal planes transcitan by industry. It was two or more times larger than an airplane at that height. When you step forward I could see he had a tail of aircraft as war, but no lights and very dark. The front was a perfect triangle filled with large round lights, not very bright. The course was regular and slow. But when they reached a place where it had clouds, makes a sort of rotation where I could see the perfect triangular shape and no longer dark tail. As they turned into the space. Find this happens rarely in the middle Stockholm. How is it possible that a similar ovjeto walks on the air without much problem? I can not believe it was I the only one seeing this."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Stockholm","Latitude":"59.33003","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
