I looked up and saw a very fast moving light and thought it was a satellite move in irregular patterns and appeared to disappear into space. I thought it was a fluke until we saw another one flying from north to south-west. I called my friend that lives down the street and he came over. During this time we saw a few more. At 8:45 he arrived and we told him what he saw. We continued to look at the sky and talk. An hour went by without seeing anything until my girlfriend spotted a white ball like object that was beneath the clouds and it looked big, the size of quarter at arms length. The object flew from west to east and again appeared to fly out to space. The last event was about 20 seconeds and flew really fast. That night it was full moon with scattered clouds. The sky wasn't really the best but good enough to clearly spot the fast moving balls of light. All of the lights were white, contained no blinking lights."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"19841","Date Submitted":"10/07/2009 12:33 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-111.932655","Date of the Event":"10/05/2009 08:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19841.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19841.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.43011,+-111.932655(19841)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19841) map </A>","Country":"United States","Region":"Arizona"}
