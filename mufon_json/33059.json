It was between 87th and 95th Street Exit ramps, when I spotted a bright, low star-like object. I mentioned it to him, and he looked out the window. At first we thought it might be a planet, but it was larger than a planet, was much closer, and very bright. It looked like it was lower than where the cloud level would be, so we then thought it may be a plane or helicopter, but it made no noise and wasn't moving in any direction. After a few minutes of looking straight at this, I noticed a faint red light, just slightly flickering on it. We looked at it all the way home.. Which was a good 10 minutes or so, and it eventually dimmed to where we could no longer see it."],"Longitude":"-94.727061","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
