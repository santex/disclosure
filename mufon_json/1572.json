I have seen just about every aircraft light configeration there is.I was sitting guard duty on the flightline and was looking out the open windowdirectly up at the big dipper when I noticed a cresent shape of 6 lights movingfrom east to west. They appeared to be fixted to one object and not independentobjects. It took less then one minute for the object to go from directlyoverhead to the point (approx 15deg) above the western horizon where the objectmade a 90deg turn south and moved off faster then my head could follow. Elevenminutes later what I believe to have been either the space shuttle or spacestation went over Golfport MS traveling from SW-NW. I have seen the shuttle andspace station pass over in the past and this last object was consistant withthose previous oberservations."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1572.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1572.html"],"Latitude":"30.37506","Case Number":"1572","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Gulfport","There were no other sightings in Gulfport on or around March 5th 2002"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Mississippi","Summary":"saw 6 lights in cresent formation","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","City":"Gulfport","Longitude":"-89.089896","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/05/2002 04:56 UTC"}
