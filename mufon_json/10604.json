This year, I decided to bring along my camera and take some shots of the houses along a golf course for my fianc��� while we were playing golf on Friday, April 18th, 2008. The timestamp on the two pictures is 3:47:22 PM EST and 3:47:26 PM EST, so 4 seconds apart. As you can see in the pictures, a black object is in the distance in both. I don't know what it is but I recall seeing pictures from other people that look similar to these pictures I've taken. This made me submit this for examination. I first noticed the object not when I was taking the picture, but after I put them on my computer a couple days ago which came as a surprise to me. I also have 2 other pictures with this same object in them. I will gladly forward them if they are wanted for review. The images are authentic, no cropping, photoshopping or image clarifying were done to them. They were shot with a Canon Powershot 8.0 mp digital camera. Also, I took around 45 other photos on that day and days prior to and the object was not seen in any of these besides the 2 other pictures I referred to earlier. Take a look and I hope someone can give me an answer as to what this may be.
