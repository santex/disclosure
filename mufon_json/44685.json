It was a clear sky out December 19th around 8:00. I spotted something i could not explain. It has a disc like shape and blinking orange lights in sequence and patterns. it was hovering and circling this one block ( 26th and santa monica) for 5 min. I pulled over and snapped 3 photos. There was also some airplane activity so i can clearly see differentiate between the planes and this object. It had no sound. completely silent. After circling the block for 5 min it passed right over me at a little higher than tree top level turned its lights off and vanished. All i can see was a dull outline and disappeared into the night. Let me know if you want the photos. Also how much do i get for the photos? Thank, and maybe you can shed some light on this amazing event."],"Case Number":"44685"}
