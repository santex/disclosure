The object would flash all different colors, every color imaginable. After watching over a period of time, there were noticeable flashes coming off the object, as though something were breaking off in flames. The flashes began to look more and more like pulses, as though the flashes were copies of the object, in different colors. This particular night, I went out to my car to get a pack of cigarettes, and noticed the object in the sky. I returned to the house and told my friends of the event outside, and they came out and witnessed the same flashing object. After watching it for approximately a half hour tonight, the object became dim, and then vanished altogether. We looked in every direction, but the object was gone."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/23/2008 03:20 UTC","City":"Englewood","Longitude":"-82.352595","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Englewood","There were no other sightings in Englewood on or around May 23rd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
