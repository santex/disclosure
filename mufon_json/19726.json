{"divs":["sighting detailsmy brother, his 10 year old son, my two teenage sons, and myself were all in my back yard. we had been skywatching all summer. we had witnessed many \"moving stars\" that would appear to flare up and sometimes go out. it sparked an interest. my brother, a supervisor at muhlenberg ambulance, brought home their night vision goggles...that apparently homeland security felt they needed. he had also purchased a lasor pointer that summer. earlier in the month, we had been flashing the pointer into the night sky and something flashed us back. that had happened about 6 times in a row. i remember as a small girl living in the country always staring up at the sky, just watching and waiting. i don't know why i knew, but i knew there was more. i had a sighting sometime in my teen years in a very public place. it was around the area of reading, pa and looked oval, but very bright. others saw it also, i called the reading airport and they said it was a blimp. it didn't look like any blimp that i had ever seen. i also had dreams into adulthood. a very vivid dream i had was being inside a circular room. i knew i was barefoot because my feet were cold, i looked down and saw a metal floor. all around me the walls looked like blue jello. inside the jello there were babies, fetus' actually, growing. they looked normal...i mean like normal babies, but they were pretty small to know yet. i wasnt scared though. then at the beginning of last spring, i woke up during the night. it has been a lifelong occurance for me to see things during the night. it's just that since i was a little kid, it was only people or blob\\bubble shaped things. last spring i awoke to see a small gold disk, it almost looked see thru, not like you'd imagine it to be more like metal. this looked almost like particles in a way. it moved slowly toward me, but angling away...as if to not scare me. it passed along side of me, and got into the corner wall up past my head and went straight up...disappearing before it hit the ceiling. so, back to this summer night. we were looking. my kids thought i was silly but we were all talking about being positive and believing that if there is intelligent life, they probably function at a higher frequency than us...which is why digital electronics pick them up and not our \"dumbed down\" human eye. i thought to being a child with no judgements or fear and said,\"lets sing twinkle twinkle little star\" so we did...all of us. we were laughing at ourselves and singing. thats when my older son said, \"oh my god what is that!?\" coming from the south right overhead, i don't know how high was this thing...it was nightime, but this thing appeared not solid, it had the oddest shape. all i could say is that it looked like a gigantic cheetos, or wavy like the shape of coral. it was maybe a peach color. but it was moving, like an rolling but definately moving. i had the night vision around my neck and looked up into it and saw like a hundred white specks or dots. i just remember thinking maybe it was transporting something. it was not illuminated, almost like just seeing a cloud in the night sky. it looked like you could've put your hand into it. it moved over us and just seemed to disappear. we sat there dazed and were just in disbelief. my older son said, thats it i'm going inside. he did and thats when the 2nd object came from the west. this was i guess oval or like a big pill, it was orange and had 3 lights that were definately illuminated right in a row. when i looked with the googles the lights seemed shaped like diamonds. it also wasn't solid, plasma? energy? i have no idea. it came directly over us and then turned on an angle to the south. we all remember feeling very cold, perhaps it was us being freaked out. my younger son said he saw something triangular shaped and black after that. he was the only one. but i knew what he meant because i had seem similiar black shapes move in the sky often. i consulted my good friend, maree mulgrew, who is a well know intuitive in our area. she believes that i have a connection. my birth middle name is orion, which my dad said he doesn't know why he gave that to me. she has told me pretty freaky things about my connection. she said one was from the pleides and the other was from the orion but they shouldn't have came thru so close to eachother. i just don't know. both objects just seemed to disappear right after they passed over my property."],"Case Number":"19726","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.564608,+-75.974207(19726)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19726) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/29/2009 08:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hamburg","There was one other sighting in Hamburg on or around July 31st 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19726.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19726.html"],"Summary":"My brother, his 10 year old son, myself and my two teenage sons all witnessed 2 sightings within 10 minutes of one another in my backyard last summer.","Country":"United States","City":"Hamburg","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-75.974207","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.564608","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval, Other, Unknown","Log Number":"US-09292009-0009","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
