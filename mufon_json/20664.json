(2 orange lights playing leapfrog with each other)btw i have been able to confirm that sighting with two friends that also saw it from different areas around littleton. the same night i reported that i was putting my son to bed and looked out my window and saw two white lights very close to the horizon around tree-top level. one would blink off and the other would be on. they would alternate. the lights were small like a star and from my point of view looked to be about 4-6 inches apart. it then started moving away over the connecticut river and south towards the mountains.. as it got further away the lights got closer together and then were gone.this made no noise whatsoever. last night 11\\21\\2009 5:00pm i was having a cigarette with my coworkers in front of the store. one said \"hey what's that?\" when we looked up we saw what looked like a very bright white light that had a tail like a tadpole. then it was gone behind the building. we were looking to the south when we saw this. again no noise. and tonight i was on the porch with my boyfriend when again we saw a light coming into our vision very slowly. it looked kind of like two stars that were very very close together. they were not blinking or twinkling. it was just a light making no noise moving very slowly. we watched it for a while. it was to the north headed west to east. i would really like to know why there has been such an increase in activity. (i have been watching the skies since may of this year when i reported my first ufo.)"],"City":"Littleton","Date Submitted":"11/22/2009 06:19 UTC","Summary":"4 Sightings in less than a week","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Littleton","There was one other sighting in Littleton on or around November 22nd 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Medium","Case Number":"20664"}
