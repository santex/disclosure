I was looking up and to the north, my wife looking to the west. I saw 2 flashes of light in my peripheral vision and my wife said did you see that and I said I saw a flash then a few seconds later as we were both looking to the west we saw 3 very distinct circular pulses of light about a second apart at approximately 30-40 degrees above the horizon and slightly north of west. The light was slightly brighter than the brighest stars. There did not appear to be any horizontal or vertical motion of the pulses. We continued to watch for a few minutes and saw nothing else. My reaction was of great curiosity as to what could have caused the distinct pulses of light. I'm still a bit baffled by the sighting."],"Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"5 pulses of light","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5102.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5102.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"46.731363","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"5102","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/17/2006 10:35 UTC","Log Number":"US-07182006-0001","trends":[]}
