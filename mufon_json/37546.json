It wasn't until after I took all the pictures that I was looking through them on my digital camera is when I saw something that I couldn't see with my naked eye. This is the second time I have caught something unexplainable on a picture I have taken in the past 2 years. I'm not sure if it is anything military or extraterristreal. In the picture you need to look up in the left side corner an zoom in to see what it is. In the second picture that I have uploaded is actually the the picture I took before I took the picture that captured the black object."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Strawberry Plains","There was one other sighting in Strawberry Plains on or around April 16th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.041448,+-83.69245(37546)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37546) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"37546","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","City":"Strawberry Plains","Date of the Event":"04/16/2012 07:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37546_submitter_file1__DSCN0808.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37546_submitter_file2__DSCN0807.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37546.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"black UFO/ object","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"36.041448","Region":"Tennessee","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/17/2012 02:08 UTC"}
