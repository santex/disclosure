I was headed south on highway 441 about 9:40 p.m. As I came upon the Exxon station just south of Dillsboro, I had a strong feeling I should look up. As I turned my eyes toward the black night sky, there it was hovering just 50 feet over the highway. It was a narrow, rectangular ship that appeared to be about 50 to 60 feet wide and 20 feet high. The ship had dim lights in no particular order. There were maybe four or five long, vertical lights salmon amber in color. The ship hovered at a slight angle as though it might be circling or perhaps seeking a place to land or crashing. I have taken flying lessons and flown over this area so I know the terrain. I heard a loud, screeching noise behind it ��� like the sound of a jumbo jet about to land. The thought crossed my mind that military jets might be chasing it. Of course, jets couldn���t fly that low and would have been forced to abruptly regain altitude. Since there was no place to pull off the highway where I felt comfortable enough to stop at night to observe it, I drove on home. As I passed under the ship I did look back but couldn���t see a thing. My immediate feeling upon seeing the ship was one of wonder. I felt surprisingly calm and also experienced a light tingling sensation. Reflecting back on the experience, it was an answer to a week-long request to see a ship for myself. What an honor to actually see one! But the story doesn't end there. For ten (10) consecutive nights I awakened exactly two seconds before 1 a.m. totally refreshed after only sleeping three (3) hours. I was given a 'knowing' that we must become economically sustainable immediately. That means we have to live in small communities, eat locally, consume only what we need locally."],"Longitude":"-83.263682","Summary":"The space craft was hovering over the highway, 35 feet above.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.317748,+-83.263682(31096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31096) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/20/2010 09:40 UTC","Case Number":"31096","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Sylva","There were no other sightings in Sylva on or around July 20th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31096.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31096_submitter_file1__UFOsite.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31096.html"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Sylva"}
