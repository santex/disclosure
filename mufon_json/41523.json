(im 13) and my friend tackled me. I looked straight up and saw a large light hovering. It was not a helicopter,star ectI knew immediatly it didnt look human like. I pointed and said look. My friend looked up and the light went off slowly and the U.F.O flew away with changing directions,speeds and altitudes. We lost sight of that ufo, but then we see 2 more hovering. this is where it gets weird. My friend, who was not dealing with this well screamed if your going to hurt us go up. The 2 simultaniously went down. We observed them for a good min. We were too scared and bailed, but before I went into my house, I noticed they definatly went up. I never lost sight of those two untill before i went to bed I looked and they were gone."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-77.187355","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41523.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41523.html"],"Case Number":"41523","Source":"MUFON","trends":[]}
