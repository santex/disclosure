I filmed a few secs of it but was hard to see in the camera and I did not think I got it until I reviewed the video later. But it was slow and gliding then changed direction pulsating or reflecting the sun, not sure it was weird looking. Attached is the video. You decide. You will see how high it is cause birds fly by as I'm filming this thing. My wife was watching a good half house and it hovered direct over us and seemed to slow down and just stay where it was."],"Log Number":"US-10282013-0007"}
