I found myself sitting on the sofa in theliving room. I have no memory of waking up or falling asleep on the sofa. WhatI did remember whats coming in to the house after seeing a huge object in thesky over a grassy area behind my house - facing south. It is in an area withgrass, tall trees and a wall blocking us off from another subdivision. I know Iwas sitting on the grass watching the object above me in the sky. I remember abeam coming down over me. After I was back in the house where I took out a penand drew a picture of what I saw. I dont know how much time was missing andonly have a bit of memory from this episode. I was in an enormous room with oneother being. I also knew there were many many other people inside the objectbut they were in some other area. I kept asking the being with me when I couldgo home. His reply was, \"you will go now\". I asked about the others in thecraft\" and he said \"it will be a long time before they will go home\". \"They arehere to help\". The next thing I knew, I was back home."],"Log Number":"","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"28.6","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1926.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1926.html"],"Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
