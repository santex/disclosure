Thinking that must be a helicopter at an odd angle, i kept staring. The object seemed to turn, and caught the sunlight on its surface. Colour was between a grey and white. It turned and I saw clearly that it was a saucer. I lost sight of it as my train pulled into the station. I felt excited and privileged to see it."],"Latitude":"51.515299","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United Kingdom","Region":"England","City":"London","trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around November 4th 2009"],"Case Number":"20313","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.515299,+-0.126195(20313)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20313) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Spotted a saucer in the sky above the clapham junction area","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/04/2009 09:25 UTC"}
