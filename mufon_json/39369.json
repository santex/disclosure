My Mother was in the passenger seat and turned slightly towards me talking, when her eyes grew HUGE and said \"what is that?\". It was about 3:00pm. Bright sunny day. At first I thought they were kites, then realized as a plane flew over, going into Air Force Base, that those were a thousand times bigger.they were in a circle. 3 huge triangles pointed inwards. They were further West. They did prepared as we turned the bend at the split. This happened many years ago. My Mother has passed away and my son was 10 years old, now he is 26. I have never forgotten and always look to the West to see if just maybe they might reappear. It seemed to me to be a strange place for them to want to hover over. I never knew where to turn. I feel kind of foolish...BUT I SAW THEM ALONG WITH MY MOM AND SON. NEVER LEAVES MY MIND."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"08/03/1995 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.282745","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/15/2012 05:06 UTC","Latitude":"34.113435","Tags":"City","Summary":"3 hovering triangles, slightly above city","City":"San Bernardino","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in San Bernardino","There were no other sightings in San Bernardino on or around August 3rd 1995"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.113435,+-117.282745(39369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39369) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
