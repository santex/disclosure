I saw a satelliteapproach from the NW. It was on a path leading it almost directly overhead. Iwatched it for7E 1 minute and before it was directly overhead, it completely stopped moving. Ihad it positioned between to telephone lines and there was no apparent movement.After about 2 minutes, it began moving again at the same rate of speed in thesame direction. I then saw another satellite approaching from the W-NW, on asomewhat lower path. When it reached about 60 degrees above the horizon, it toocompletely stopped for a couple of minutes. I saw a third satellite approachfrom the west, but the cloud cover became thick and I could no longer see it. Ihad the impression that a small point of light briefly flashed from the firstsatellite, I think this was before it stopped. Ive seen a lot of satellites andthe ISS, but have never seen any stop before."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
