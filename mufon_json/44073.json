Parkville Md. 6:00Pm. I was heading to the store when I had the urge to look up. I noticed a starlike object flickering. I've never seen this before. I went inside and grabbed my camcorder. When I zoomed in, this is what I saw. A Pulsating light changing all colors of the color spectrum. Moved very, very slowly. I was able to set my camcorder up on a tripod. After stabilizing the tripod and centering the object, the object slowly moved out of frame. Lasted for over an hour. The object seemed to move on a straight path heading slowly into outer space. I called several of my neighbors and they all witnessed the object with me. Looking at the view finder, We were all pretty amazed at what we were watching. I will try to post the video at a later date."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11212012-0013","Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"39.292455","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44073.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44073.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
