Sometimes they travelled west towards the Manzano Mtns. and looked like they either descended into the mtns or the light was just turned off. Prior to any movement there is always a bright blinking light from the Socorro mtn direction. I sent the a digital photo to the exec. director of Mufon. I could not get my files to attach to this report. I also have two additional pictures. It looks like a stationary star, but when you photograph it...you can see it moves pretty rapidly."],"Region":"New Mexico"}
