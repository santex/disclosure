Anonymous. I just thought you would like to know i saw something. I was Driving down dodge st. (76th and Dodge) Above was a hovering triangle. 3 white lights one corners with one slow pulsating red light in the middle. Hovering low. Thought it was a Helicopter....it wasnt. drove past and looked in my rear view mirror and it was gone. Ive seen this damn thing twice now thats the only reason im typing something on this site. The first time was over the woodman building in downtown omaha a few months ago. (4a.m That time it flew over along with another white light that wasnt connected. just following it. Pretty amazing..but scared the hell out of me. enjoy. i know many have reporting this same thing through looking it up on the net. so whatever that triangle is, ive seen it."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/04/2007 11:13 UTC","Summary":"Driving down dodge st.
