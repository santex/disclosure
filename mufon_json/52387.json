My friends mom invited me on a boat trip from Anacortes,WA,to Everett,Wa on a boat. I jumped at the chance to fish and boat in the Puget sound. We travelled south to Everett,moored and slept on the first night. We walked around the port for the day,observing the aircraft carrier that was moored at the port as well. Around five we began moving north towards home. I looked towards Everett 45 minutes later and observed three to four bright orbs above the city. I yelled at everyone to look. Then there where five,then eight,then three,then five. this continued for ten minutes. Then there was six,then three, then one. They always appeared in different positions. Ive seen video on youtube of the same exact thing. I know that there is something else observing us. Im 33 now,I was 17 at the time of the event. Thank you for reading this and I hope I wasnt the only one that day."],"trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Everett","There were no other sightings in Everett on or around August 16th 1997"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.983535,+-122.196909(52387)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52387) map </A>"}
