(which of course she couldnt). what i saw was very high in the sky, it was somewhat difficult to see, unless you knew just where to look.what i noticed was not a commercial airliner at all. there was the red and blue lights. but there was also a green colored light as well. i say that the object was triangular because of this. it appeared like a red blue and green light bunched together. as this object moved from the north to the south very slowly, it rotated in a clockwise motion slowly ,but noticably. i watche the object for about 4 minutes then i decided to get the camera to try to snap a few pictures of it. i went into the house for about 1 minute and when i came out it was still in the sky. it hadnt moved much at all. i was unable to get any photos, because i could not locate the objet through the sights of my camera. so i just sat there watching this thing until it was out of my sifght. i watched for about 13 to 15 minutes. the only thing that i thought that it might be was maybe some kind of satalite or something. this object was very high in the sky, in fact had there been clouds i would not have seen it at all. after the sighting, i went inside the house and called 2 of the television stations just to see if they had anything on radar. i didnt report it as a u.f.o. i was just asking if there anything in our particular area. one of the stations blew me off, and one of them actually said that they would look into it. they got my address and phone number. but of course i never heard fom them. i know that i saw something. i do not know what it was, but there was something up there just cruising along. i believe that i was not a terrestrial aircraft because of the way that it was slowly rotating. and it was moving to slow to be some kind of airplane. and it was very high. i know that i saw this object, i cant explain it, i just wish that someone else had witnessed it with me."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Chickasha","There were no other sightings in Chickasha on or around April 30th 2003"],"City":"Chickasha","Region":"Oklahoma","Longitude":"-97.934433","Date of the Event":"04/30/2003 12:00 UTC"}
