The large object appeared over the microwave cell tower. There was a whooshing sound with the object which first appeared as 3 large triangular white lights. I have a coleman compass which I had on my front seat. The compass whirled. As I looked up again, I noted the structure behind the lights and saw it was one object, not 3 separate triangles. It passed over my suv in all its brightness. Several cars were in the area by the intersection on this overcast rainy morning. I was a former UFO investigator and this is my second sighting since 2008, the Bucks County flap."],"Object Features":"Dome","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
