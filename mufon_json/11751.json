I am very confused about what i saw. i realize that it would be arrogant for us to think we are alone in the universe but never really 100% that we were being visited by other life forms"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.492122,+-122.79782(11751)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11751) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/26/2008 03:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Beaverton","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11751.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11751.html"],"Log Number":"US-07262008-0009","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON"}
