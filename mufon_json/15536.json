{"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 1:00 AM on February 16, 2009, I was sitting on the side of my house with my boyfriend. I looked above my neighbor���s house and in the northern sky we noticed something odd. I am used to seeing airplanes pass over the houses but this was no airplane. There were stationary 2 lights in the sky. They appeared to be very high in the sky. I watched them for a few minutes assuming they would move, they did not. The stayed still and blinked a white light. The light on the right side blinked about 5 times very quickly, and then the second would do the same as if answering back. This conversation happened about 4 times. After the blinking stopped the two lights moved to the center and appeared to join. They paused for a few seconds and quickly sped off upward into the dark sky. While this was happening it was silent outside. My boyfriend and I both agree these couldn���t have been regular planes. The way in which they acted was very odd."],"Date of the Event":"02/17/2009 01:00 UTC","Longitude":"-87.733393","City":"Skokie","Date Submitted":"02/17/2009 01:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.033364","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15536.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15536.html"],"Case Number":"15536","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.033364,+-87.733393(15536)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15536) map </A>","Summary":"Two UFOs blinking conversation, joining, and speeding off","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Skokie","There were no other sightings in Skokie on or around February 17th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-02162009-0029"}
