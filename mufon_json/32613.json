It was during the summer and in 1973 we had no AC and was so hot my wife and I were unable to sleep when all of a sudden the entire house was lighting up with red green white and I believe another color. I jumped out of bed and ran into the living room to see what was going on and my wife followed and we went out on the ffont steps and there was a storage building about 300 ft.in front so all we could see was the brilliant circulating lights. They continued over to about the lake and descended and just suddenly went off.in a few minutes my wife went back into the house but I was fascinated and waited to see if it was coming back up.I waited about 10 to 15 minutes and. Suddenly. The circulating lights came back on and started rising and before it was high enough for me to see they went back off and when it got high enough for me to see it was white glowing ball of light I would estimate to be 30 to 30 ft. In diameter and started mooiving north slowly then accelerated at an impossible rate at about a 45degree angle and dissapeared in about a 100th of second before reaching the altitude a normal airplane flies."],"Date Submitted":"10/16/2011 12:25 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Newport","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Tennessee","Source":"MUFON"}
