{"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsA group of around 10 from a music feastival of 100 saw these lights. A friend spotted it in the sky and told us where to look. I thought it was a UFO. The constellation of Scorpio was low to the horizon. The three lights came from 'far to the right' and moved across the sky towards Scorpio where it dipped down and appeared to move through the tail of Scorpio between the first star (closest to the body of Scorpio) and the next star in the tail of Scorpio. The object appeared to take up about a sixth of the distance between the two Scorpio stars. I was excited...so was everyone else... The object slowly dimmed out of site after going through Scorpio's tail. From arms length, it appeared to be around an inch on each side...as I said it took up around a sixth of the distance between the two stars closest to the body of Scorpio."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.484938","Summary":"triangle of three lights moving insync across the sky.","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.484938,+-119.966284(3511)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3511) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Mariposa","There were no other sightings in Mariposa on or around June 25th 2005"],"Date of the Event":"06/25/2005 09:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/25/2005 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-119.966284","Case Number":"3511","Log Number":"US-06272005-0008","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3511.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3511.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Mariposa","Source":"MUFON"}
