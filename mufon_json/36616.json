When looked directly at, they would make you feel major discomfort and nausea. The closer you were the more trouble with electronics. Made a small \"Static\" sound. Backs turned to me, so I didn't see face. When a Helicopter with a searchlight showed up they ran as fast as 30-40 MPH. No UFO found, weird green gunk found in place I found them. When they ran away, I went back home and wrote this report. before I was exploring a forest."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
