{"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/30/1987 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking upstairs and looked out a large window where the stairs turned at the halfway point. I saw a multi color lighted saucer shaped thing hovering silently just 10-15 feet away. It was no more than 1.5 feet in diameter. I thought someoneone had a neat remote controlled flying saucer. I watched it when suddenly it flew away at a high rate of speed, faster than what seemed possible. I remember watching it fly several several blocks thinking that where I perceived it to be, at this distance, I shouldn't be able to see it anymore. It also may have appeared grey at this distance. Then it was gone. I sat there thinking did this just happen? What was this? The moment was gone, and I wished I could have it back, it was just too strange."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8224.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8224.html"],"City":"Portland","Longitude":"-122.673817","Region":"Oregon","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/30/1987 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.528902,+-122.673817(8224)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8224) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around November 30th 1987"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Latitude":"45.528902","Summary":"small discoid with multi-colored lights hovered near house","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10272007-0001","Case Number":"8224","Country":"United States"}
