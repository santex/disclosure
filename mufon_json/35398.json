It appeared to break up or burn up to my East and break into pieces. My Estimate that it was first observed from my ground observation West of Carrollton, TX and broke up over Garland,TX. Started at 25 degrees to the West on horizon, past directly overhead and ended 30 degrees from the East horizon. Definitely the largest meteor I have ever seen lasting (to my eyes)30 secs and glowing red hot than exploding and going out. Most have been a huge meteor to last that long and make it so low into the atmosphere."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.10495,+-96.72063(35398)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35398) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Plano","There were no other sightings in Plano on or around February 1st 2012"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/01/2012 07:58 UTC","Object Features":"None","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"02/01/2012 09:22 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
