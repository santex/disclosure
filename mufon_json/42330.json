When I looked up at the sky, I saw a very bright cigar shaped object. I knew it was moving very fast because it passed behind a pole at the top of a hill. I then ran in and got my camera and started to film. I was very shakey and tried to zoom in and then out to try to get the hill for referance. When I went to try to stabalize the camera, it was gone."],"trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around September 6th 2012"],"Object Features":"Dome","Log Number":"US-09062012-0005"}
