I ran outside to see what was wrong. It was a clear night, the stars were bright,the dogs all stopped barking at the same time. Suddenly a bright white object shot out from behind the stars and startled me. I felt a little fearful. It stopped and hovered for a second, then suddenly at a fast speed it headed East within a split second and was out of sight. I did not hear any noise or see any lights or vapors. The dogs and I went back inside the house.I felt a little shaken from the experience,sounds silly, but I think I was afraid of being abducted."],"Date of the Event":"06/20/2012 10:00 UTC","Summary":"A bright white object shot out from behind the stars and startled me, hovered for a second, then at a high speed headed East","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.656711","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Circle","Date Submitted":"07/09/2012 09:34 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40643.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40643.html"],"Log Number":"US-07092012-0024","Region":"Wyoming","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"40643"}
