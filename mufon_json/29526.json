I uploaded it to youtube to view. Search strange shape shifting UFO Chicago to watch. I dont know what it is only that it wasnt a balloon or garbage flying over. It reflected light and changed various shapes but stayed mostly snake like in its move movement. Hopefully some one out there knows what it is. I admit that I am pro UFO so I am biased to what it is but who knows. No pics below only video on the web.
