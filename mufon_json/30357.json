I was traveling north on the 101 freeway, and something in the sky caught my eye. I thought it might be a small white plane, but then the sun shined on it, as it must have tilted a bit, and it had a silver metallic surface. It was oval shaped, and i kept my eye on it as it traveled from south to north for about 3 to 5 seconds, then it just vanished into thin air!!! I kept looking and looking for it, but it was gone!!! This is my second sighting in three weeks, and i am stunned!!"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"34.149219","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.149219,+-118.803797(30357)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30357) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Westlake Village","There were no other sightings in Westlake Village on or around July 26th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"07/26/2011 01:52 UTC","Case Number":"30357","Date Submitted":"07/26/2011 08:21 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","City":"Westlake Village"}
