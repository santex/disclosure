I was driving home from work and saw a row of orange lights come on then quickly go out. Then a few seconds later they came on again in the same pattern and quickly faded out again. Didn't see them again after that. I arrived at my house about 2 minutes after I saw them and looked in the direction of where I saw the lights and saw nothing. About 5 minuets later a Military Jet Zoomed over my area coming in the opposite direction of those lights. We have B-1's and C-130's here where I live the lights were not those and the Military Jet was also not the normal B-1 or C-130 we see here. I see those planes frequently and it was a smaller plane than the B-1."],"Summary":"Orange Lights","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.452136,+-99.723644(21579)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21579) map </A>","Longitude":"-99.723644","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were no other sightings in Abilene on or around January 21st 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
