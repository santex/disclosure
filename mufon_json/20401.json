{"Log Number":"US-11092009-0009","Summary":"Bright orange globe in the horizon","divs":["Sighting DetailsI came to the stop sign a the end of a road and in front of me on the opposite side of the road there is an open field several acres long which gave me a clear view of the horizon. It was almost completely dark outside and off in the horizon i saw 2 bright orange globe shaped objects which were rather large in size considering how far away they were, and yes i've seen lots of planes in the sky and it looked a lot bigger than even the largest planes would appear from this far away. I sat there in my car just watching these objects floating stationary in the same place for about 3 minutes until the light given off from them started to fade and they disappeared."],"Longitude":"-84.51099","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/09/2009 01:46 UTC","Latitude":"39.110618","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Cincinnati","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Egg, Oval","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/08/2009 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.110618,+-84.51099(20401)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20401) map </A>","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Cincinnati","There was one other sighting in Cincinnati on or around November 8th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"20401","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20401.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20401.html"]}
