My wife and children oood and ahhhd then the light went off completely as it descended. My oldest daughter wanted to go to the road to find it...and my youngest was panicky and wanted to go inside the house. About 3 minutes later to the North West I saw the same light over my garage ...HIGH in the sky. Asked my wife if she had seen it,,,she had...But we kept it very quiet so as not to disturb the children further. Stayed outside playing with the kids with no more sightings.
