It was about as high as the jets fly overhead, higher than the commercial jets that take off and land at MCI. There were no normal lights that signify that it was a commercial flight. I lost sight of it very quickly as the city lights washed out the object. The object was bigger than a commercial jet and was travelling in a straight path faster than a commercial jet."],"Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Overland Park","Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.988378","Date of the Event":"10/31/2008 08:20 UTC","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Overland Park","There were no other sightings in Overland Park on or around October 31st 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13452.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13452.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/31/2008 08:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10312008-0029","Region":"Kansas","Case Number":"13452","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.661552","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Defuse object heading South to North"}
