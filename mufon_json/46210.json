The one closest to me appeared the largest but the others were further away and could not determine exact size. I and my husband and dog observed objects shooting light beams at each other. There were several smaller objects in between the three white objects and they had different colors than the main craft and were smaller in size. They also appeared to be projecting light beams along the triangular formation along the main sides. The two other objects formed the base of the triangle. This is not the first time I have seen this happen in our area and I am not sure what they were fighting over. My dog is who brought this to my attention. He kept looking up at the sky and whining that when I noticed the apparent battle going on between these objects the first night and they were at it again when I went out tonight. I am beginning to wonder what they are fighting for. Territory or what no telling. I was walking my dog both nights when I observed them thanks to Leroy my dog."],"Latitude":"36.630976","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-93.941954","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"12:59:59","Case Number":"46210","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46210.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46210.html"],"trends":["there have been no other sightings in cassville\\washburn","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Log Number":"US-03152013-0003","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/15/2013 01:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Starlike objects verriering in size","Region":"Missouri"}
