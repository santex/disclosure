At first I thought it was a plane, since I see many planes take that flight path! When I looked away for a second, I tried looking for it, but all I saw was what appeared to be white ball falling from the sky, from way up high! I was in shock, cuz I've never seen anything fall from such a high altitude, and nothing at ALL in it's surrounding!! I lost view of it when it went behind azusa mountains!! I've witnessed many other sightings at night, but this thing just fell from the sky or ejected something and just disappeared! I live close to the canyon, so it was clear as day, but NOT close enough to describe object!
