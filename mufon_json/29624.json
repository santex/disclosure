It was traveling in a straight line from north to south.It traveled in a flat line along the horizon.It was very reflective so it was easy to detect.I didn't know what it might be but when it disappeared twice I first thought UFO. This object was cigar shaped.It had a short vapor trail.As I watched it the vapor trail began to vanish. As the vapor trail was almost gone,the object disappeared.This vanishing and re-appearing happened twice in a cloudless sky. After the second vanishing both trail and object totally disappeared. The event lasted approx 2 min.I have never seen anything like it. the event didn't last long enough for a photo or a video."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.749091,+-121.420023(29624)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29624) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"As the sun was setting I noticed a strange object in the sky to the west.
