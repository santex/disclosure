I took two pictures and then looked at my digital camera and saw this item in them. I took a third picture and it did not appear. I didn't have any idea what this was but when I put pictures on my computer and enlarged them it doesn't appear to be anything I can figure out. I didn't see this item until I looked at the pictures so I don't know where it came from or where it went. These three pictures were taken within seconds of each other."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in California City","There were no other sightings in California City on or around April 27th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-117.985904","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4726.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4726_submitter_file1__ufo1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4726_submitter_file2__ufo2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4726_submitter_file3__ufo3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4726.html"],"Country":"United States"}
