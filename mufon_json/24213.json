{"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.525452","Summary":"Two orange orbs moved slowly across the sky in a locked formation headed south.","divs":["Sighting DetailsTwo orange spheres moved across the sky heading south over the city of Portland at about 1 AM. We were having a party for the fourth of July. Someone pointed it out and about 20 of us saw this event. There was no variation in the orange color of the orbs. That is to say that it did not appear to be engines. There were no flashing lights, just a solid orange glow. It is really hard to say how far away the orbs were as they appeared to be away in the distance but then the orbs would be massive. There was no sound. They moved at a steady pace across the sky and then faded as they disappeared heading south."],"Case Number":"24213","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There was one other sighting in Portland on or around July 5th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-07052010-0063","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/05/2010 01:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","City":"Portland","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-122.673077","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24213.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.525452,+-122.673077(24213)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24213) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 03:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Oregon"}
