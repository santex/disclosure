Then I noticed that it was moving. It was brilliantly lit, and far to large to be a star.The size looked about four times larger than the north star. I would estimate height to be about 5000 ft, and range about 1-2 miles. It stayed on this heading, and I watched it for about 10 seconds, when suddenly it just dissappeared. Just like turning off a light switch. Gone. I knew then,that I had seen something very unusual."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Houston","Summary":"While having morning coffee, sitting on front porch, witnessed what first appeared to be a very large star, but it was moving.","Latitude":"29.817513","Date of the Event":"08/07/2008 05:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-95.517868","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11991.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11991.html"],"trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There was one other sighting in Houston on or around August 7th 2008"],"Region":"Texas","Case Number":"11991","Date Submitted":"08/07/2008 05:50 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08082008-0018","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
