{"divs":["Sighting Details Hello, My name is Nicholas L. Gee I left a message in regards to a sighting I just witnessed. Here is a rough drawing of what I saw with details. I live in San Ramon California 94582. The sighting was at 7:38PM Pacific Time on November 25th 2012 I was looking at an approximate 45 Degree angle just under the Moon at 126 Degrees South East. I noticed a very bright group of spheres in a offset Triangular pattern as seen in the drawing move from 126 Degrees SE to 86 Degrees E in a matter of 3 seconds. They were totally silent. I could not get my iPhone video recorder up fast enough before they disappeared entirely from sight at 86 Degrees East. My exact coordinates are 37 Degrees 46��� 31��� N, 121 Degrees 56��� 56��� W. My number is 408-368-5143. Please contact me for more details and I would really like to know if anyone else saw this. Regards, Nicholas L.
