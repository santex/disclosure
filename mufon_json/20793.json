THESE SILVERBLUE DIAMONDS (IN COLOR, NO RED, NO GREEN) KEPT EXACT DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH OTHER AS THEY PASSED. SINCE I COULDN'T TELL HOW HIGH UP THEY WERE, I COULDN'T CALCULATE THEIR SPEED, BUT IT WAS FAIRLY RAPID. THEY DEFINITELY WERE IN OUR ATMOSPHERE, AND I HOPED THE 'GAP' BETWEEN THEM WOULD BE SOLID-- INDICATING 'SOMETHING' OF GREAT SIZE. BUT NO, AS THEY PASSED OVER, THE FIXED STARS BEYOND THEM WERE VISIBLE, NO LIGHT DISTORTION. AS THE 2 OBJECTS PASSED 'BENEATH' THE MOON, THEY SILENTLY AND QUICKLY FADED OUT OF VISIBILITY. NO HIGH CLOUDS OR FOG THEY COULD HAVE DISAPPEARED INTO, MOON STILL SHINING BRIGHTLY. HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THIS UNUSUAL SINCE JAN '74 WHEN I WAS IN THE DC AREA..."],"Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20793.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20793.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:02:22","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.111896,+-122.252127(20793)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20793) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/29/2009 02:12 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/25/2009 06:23 UTC","Latitude":"38.111896","Summary":"TWO STARLIKE LIGHTS PASSING OVERHEAD","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Vallejo","There were no other sightings in Vallejo on or around November 25th 2009"],"Longitude":"-122.252127","Object Features":"None","City":"Vallejo","Disposition":"IFO"}
