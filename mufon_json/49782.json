No lights and it made no sound. I watched as it made a small change of direction and continued south by southeast. The object was orangish and seemed to be lit on the inside. that was why I noticed it. It was lighter than the twighlight sky. The fact that I heard no sound made me curious. It was sort or boomerang shape or more like the crescent of a bow before it is stretched out t fire an arrow."],"Summary":"airplanes fluy over my house regularly. this had no sound. went overhead, made small direction change. boomerang shape. had aura or 'energy field'","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
