Silent. Fairly slow. They flew out to the horizon and the bar on right moved left & merged into bar on left and flew on as one bar. Shortly thereafter the right bar moved back to its original position to the right and they flew on out of sight after making an oblique left turn. Saw nothing connecting the 2 bars. The small \"strobelike\" lights that ran top to bottom of the 2 bars blinked very fast but in no apparent sequence, not 1,2,3,4 etc. but like 1,8,6,3,7 etc. Couldn't tell if it were 2 objects or just 1. Appeared quite low but can't estimate altitude or size. Impression was it [they] were large. Bars looked dim, \"strobes\" looked bright. What did I see??? I was awe struck!"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.259306","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Minnesota","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Fog","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"2 bars of light studded w/small blinking lights.vertical,silent .Blend into 1, then separate .","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/30/1986 12:00 UTC","City":"Minneapolis","Latitude":"44.987955","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"4456","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Minneapolis","There were no other sightings in Minneapolis on or around November 30th 1986"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.987955,+-93.259306(4456)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4456) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other"}
