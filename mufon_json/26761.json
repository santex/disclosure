We where sitting on in the livingroom whatching TV and I looked out the glass door and saw a weird contrail that was not there 5 minutes before. My Daughter and my wife, and I went outside to get a better look and to check out the rest of the sky. I took pictures and will post with this report. The direction of the contrail was 278 degrees west of my location at 1705 hrs. through 1815 hrs. Dark. The contrail seemed to appear out of nowhere and the angle of turn was 90 dergrees. As far as I know we have no aircraft that can make that kind of angle at speed fast enough to creat a contrail. 2. The shape and location. 3. a really weird looking contrail. 4. It was more like the aftermath or leavings of the object. 5. Agitated and Anxious. 6. It got dark. note: It might be importent to know that there where clouds in the area and these clouds where moving with the breeze but the Contrail remaind stationary."],"Latitude":"29.432162","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"11/27/2010 05:05 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.432162,+-98.491678(26761)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26761) map </A>"}
