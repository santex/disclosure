As I was smoking I was staring at the night sky as I always do. I caught movement from my periphrial vision coming from the North West. I first noticed the three faint red lights in a triangle and thought maybe it was a meteorite, but there was no tail and the lights didn't change color. As It crossed my 12:00 the nearly full moon showed the wedge shape quite well. As a retired Air Force member I'm quite familiar with aircraft and their flight characteristics. The object was flying at approximately 10,000 ft and made no noise. I waited well past it had crossed the South East horizon listening for any sound and heard none. The object was approximately 200 ft in length and 50 ft thick with three red lights on the underside. It appeared to be black or at least non-reflective in color and texture. The time it took to cross from the Nothwest to the Southeast was approximately 3-4 seconds."],"Summary":"Black Wedge w/red lights cross horizon to horizon in 3-4 seconds","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"11/21/2007 12:00 UTC"}
