Noticed two weird streaks of light within a 20 minute period approx 8pm Saturday night. Very fast moving. First in the west sky and one in the east. The first one I thought must have been a shooting star. Appeared to me for approx 10 seconds, shot across the sky with a white light and white trail and then vanished. When I noticed it again later in a different spot I thought that was quite a coincidence."],"Log Number":"US-11072010-0015","Summary":"Star like streaks of light","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.531389,+-90.933056(26420)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26420) map </A>","Region":"Missouri"}
