The object had three red lights in a row across the bottom that flashed one after another repeatedly. On each of the four corners there were solid white lights. My sister who was next to me was also able to get a good look, and admitted to not having an explanation, even though she is highly skeptical. My dad was driving and pulled over but at this point the trees were in the way."],"Latitude":"30.155278","Longitude":"-95.211389","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/28/2013 09:12 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.155278,+-95.211389(52478)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52478) map </A>"}
