Observed very bright red ball approaching my house from the south about 20 degrees above horizon appearing out of nowhere. Continued directly overheard and had no tail. Detected a slight flickering as it faded out. Immediately second one in exact same flightpath appeared and flew over. Then a third and fouth in exact sequence of about 1 minute each flew over same flightpath. These were not chinese lanterns. No wind, clear,temp 71 degrees. Reminded me of a helicopter speed and probaby over 1500 feet with no noise. It was not any type of manmade aircraft or meteor. I called to my son who saw 2 or 3 seconds of last fireball. His opinion is these so called fireballs are some kind of energy particles coming from the sun and entering earth's atmosphere. He may be right!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-72.31484","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date Submitted":"08/04/2013 01:53 UTC","City":"Sag Harbor","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08042013-0021","Summary":"Four bright red balls flew over home exactly 1 minute apart","Region":"New York","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sag Harbor","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"None"}
