We ate lunch and stopped at Edgewater park and took more pictures, several of downtown Cleveland. Nothing unusual was noted that day, weather was perfect. On review of the days pictures several containted unknown objects. The earliest was at 11:23 am from near the Rock and Roll hall of fame and included a docked ship, the Mather. This is the earliest photo to have some unknown objects. Most of the objects are in the photos from Edgewater. The best includes one in front of a building which gives you a good idea of scale. The last photo taken that includes anything was at about 1:24 pm. Two different cameras captured the same object."],"Region":"Ohio"}
