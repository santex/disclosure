That's when I said then where are the propellors and why is it all light. He then took a closer look and said \"Whatever it is just leave it alone, we don't want to get involved in those sort of tales\"! Then I turned the corner and it was GONE! no noise, no trail, no sound. I looked at my friend and said where did it go? He then looked at me and said you properly was imagining it.
