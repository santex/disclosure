{"divs":["Sighting DetailsCIRCULAR TYPE OBJECT, SEAM TO CHANGE SHAPE THAT REMINDED ME OF SOME THING ON FIRE. OBJECT MOVED SLOWLY. IT HAD STRANGE REFLECTIVE PROPERTIES, THAT LOOKED SIMILAR TO A FIRE IN THAT THE LIGHT FROM IT SIMMERED OR REFLECTED LIKE A FIRE. BUT AT SAME TIME WASN'T. IT MOVED IN STRAIGHT LINES FORWARD AND REVERSE AN EAST AND WEST. OBJECT ALSO FLOATED IN ONE SPOT. OBJECT SLOWLY HEADED NORTH UNTIL IT WAS A SMALL YELLOWISH RED ORANGE BALL SHAPE AND THEN WITH A BLINK OF THE EYE WAS GONE. SEVERAL PEOPLE IN OMAHA NEBRASKA SAID THEY ALSO SAW IT. OMAHA IS 40 MILES SOUTH OF THE LOCATION I WAS AT. AS MY WIFE AND I WATCHED IT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE JOGED BY US CHASING IS THING. THESE TWO MEN SAID THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING IT FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. THE WHOLE EXPERENCE WAS STRANGE AND EXCITING. I STILL THINK OF THIS OFTEN. I HAVE SEEN OTHER ODD THINS IN THE SKY BEFORE BUT NEVER FOR A 15-20 MINUTE PERIOD."],"Date Submitted":"02/28/2010 05:39 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22052.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22052.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/15/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Little Sioux","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"22052","City":"Little Sioux","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02282010-0023","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.809432","Longitude":"-96.021123","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.809432,+-96.021123(22052)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22052) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"WE WERE AT CAMPER MY WIFE AND I ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE ALSO SEEN IT.","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Sphere, Other","Region":"Iowa"}
