I continued to observe for two minutes and eventually one of the craft flew away from the formation to the left and the other one stayed a bit longer and then went off to the right. My friend also saw the event from a different place. I was very excited during the event and was pulled over into a neighborhood where I flagged down a car with a family who also saw it briefly."],"Case Number":"20259","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Doylestown","There were no other sightings in Doylestown on or around November 1st 2009"],"Tags":"City"}
