At this point, I am still a bit unsure of the date and time, but I can find out more precise information if needed. Let me disclose that I am ex-military, with 4 years experience with, on, and around military aircraft...everything from A-6's to U-2's. That being said, I am at a loss for what I witnessed this night. It was a Thursday night and I was traveling to my deer lease on the edge of Brown County. I live in Dallas, but I had been down South the days leading up and to Thursday for work. I decided to take Friday off to enjoy a three day weekend deer hunting. I turned off of Mills county road 574 outside the town of Goldthwaite and began heading north on Mills county road 531. Because I was near the county Line dividing Mills and Brown county it's not possible to tell if I was still on 531 or Brown county road 267 where the event happened. As you travel from Mills County on CR 531 into Brown County, the road then becomes CR 267. It was very dark and I had never traveled from this particular direction before, so it is hard to determine where exactly I was in relationship to recognizable landmarks. As I was traveling northward, I suddenly noticed a brilliantly bright white light flickering through the darkened silhouette of trees. It was on the left side of the road which in relation would be northwest I'm guessing, and it appeared to be approximately 100-200 yards ahead of me, again on the left side of the road. I slowed down and rolled down my window to investigate. The light was intensely bright with the primary color being white with hues or flashes of orange or red. It was so bright and appeared with such little warning that my first thought was that a plane had just crashed. I began to try to rationalize the information but became more puzzled when I realized that I hadn't heard an explosion or and audible signature of a crash of any kind. This is an extremely rural area that is very sparsely populated. As I continued slowly ahead I kept trying to find a break in the trees to get a better look at the object. At this point I was still trying to find and evidence that this was not what I was beginning to think it was, a UFO. I thought for a second that it could be an electrical fire. But I quickly dismissed this when first I didn't hear the patented arcing and tracking noise that accompanies a high voltage phase fault, nor did I see the characteristic blue-white flashing flames. I finally stopped after I had gotten almost parallel with the light and kept squinting through the openings in the brush and trees. Suddenly, as quickly as it had appeared, it stopped with-out a trace. I turned off my truck and listen as intently as I could with my mind racing for an explanation. I grabbed my cell and called a friend of mine who is familiar with the area. I was explaining to him what I had experienced and that I wanted him to keep an eye out on the news for a plane crash near my deer lease. We had been talking for maybe 3 minutes when I notice several helicopters approaching. I could hear them as well as see the navigation strobes. They approached from approximately the North West in no particular formation. Once near I counted at least ten helicopters in the immediate area. The oddest thing about their presence was that many of the aircraft had its search light scanning the terrain. They seemed to have been focusing their interest a bit north and west of my location and never came closer than 300-400 yards of my truck. After several minutes of loitering in the area they began to continue westward over a high ridge until out of my sight. The presence of the helicopters urged me to consider two explanations to the event. Either an aircraft crashed and didn't make a sound, extinguished itself after approximately 4 or 5 minutes, and incinerated itself to-where no evidence was left behind. Or, I had witnessed a UFO of some sorts and the attempt of several military aircraft to find it and or track it. I don't know what I saw that night, but I know many things it wasn't. The object seemed to be hovering near the ground but at the time I couldn't tell how near. The next day I re-traced my step as best as I could. Most of the area tree wise is made up of Mesquites with hardwoods sporadically sprinkled in. The common characteristic of a Mesquite tree is that is doesn't grow nearly as tall as lets say an oak. The terrain in other words was fairly low. From ground level the average tree line could be anywhere from 12-20' tall with the occasional hardwood tree cluster being considerable taller. Whatever I witnessed never appeared above the trees, but at the same time it didn���t appear to be on the ground and or stable in movement. It seemed to float in a specific area not so much swaying but increasing and decreasing in size as the intensity of the light pulsated, never blinking or strobing, but pulsing slowly shades of white and orange-red. I would like to stress that I never got an un-obstructed view of the object and that I make no claims as to what it was other than \"un-identifiable. I did find the presence of so many helicopters in the immediate area so quickly very conspicuous and interesting and that is the only motivation to file this report. Anybody can claim they saw something in the sky that can't be substantiated by third parties. Military aircraft, or any earth bound aircraft for that matter can't fly without leaving evidence of their actions. I also so think it's interesting all this happened in such close proximity to a military training facility. The National Guard training grounds are just a few miles up the road on the west side of CR 267. This event was certainly in a civilian area but close enough to Military instillations to cause me concern. I doubt this has any bearing but I do remember as I was on the phone and as the helicopters were leaving the area, a white Ford Diesel coming from the opposite direction passed me heading south towards CR574."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10321.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10321.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10321.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Longitude":"-98.989251","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"12/01/2007 08:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"10321","City":"Brownwood","Date Submitted":"12/01/2007 08:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Other, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
