It was around 12 30 at night when she said that she saw a light come from the ceiling into the room with us and the light was behind me then like an hour later we took a short drive out to look and as soon as we parked a light from the sky which looked like a beam of light struck me and you could see the light on my sweat shirt then a moment later a second beam came down and again you could see the light hit my sweat shirt, then after that we moved up the road a little and 2 more beams came but this time the light went further down into the car touching my legs and then after that the beams of light flashed around my car. The beam of light was white with a yellow tint and was the size if a softball. I really think that it was the UFO that I nicknamed Flasher."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.779461","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"-03012010-0001","Longitude":"-119.413932","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Fog","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.779461,+-119.413932(22067)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22067) map </A>"}
