I noticed something In the sky. The Object appeared to be moving from east to west. What caught my eye was the shimmer of direction change. The shimmer was very subtle. It appeared to be white in color, didnt really appear to be very reflective. The Object appeared to be rectangular or cigar shapped. The Object appeared to turn South-southwest, and leave at an high rate of speed. Object was gone within 1-2 seconds after it made the turn. Wife was in the vehicle asleep. Woke her up to make note of sighting. Decided to report after watching a program on the history channel. One of the opening pictures looked very similar to the Object I had seen."],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Square, Rectagular","Date of the Event":"08/01/2006 03:18 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5243.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5243.html"],"Region":"Oklahoma","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"35.052565","Case Number":"5243"}
