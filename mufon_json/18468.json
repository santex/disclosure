Rose Valley is located in Southern California north on highway 33 near Ojai and Ventura. We pulled off the road and parked in front of a closed dirt road. The road ahead was blocked by a barricade but we continued anyway. At the top of the road we encountered a red glowing orb in the background approximately 1 foot in diameter and about 15 feet off the road. One of my friends walked toward it to see what it was when it floated closer to us revealing that the orb was disembodied and floating in mid air. We freaked out and started running back toward the car, and realized that it was following us about 10 feet behind. Once we got around the bend, it stopped following us and we returned to our car and left. We would like to find out more about this strange event if anyone can help or have received any other reports like this in the Ventura county please let us know. Thanks."],"Region":"California","Log Number":"US-08042009-0005","City":"Ojai","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.237699","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
