{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing in my backyard and saw two orange lights. I noticed them after looking up to see what was making noise in the tree. (It was a squirrel). They were about one hundred yards apart and I would estimate 1,000 ft. above the ground. I could not see waht was between them but it was darker than the rest of the sky so I assume thre was something there. They moved across the sky silently from the N.W. to the S.E. right over my house. They disappeared about three blocks from my house. I felt very nervous after i saw this but eventually calmed down and felt a kind of content feeling."],"Date of the Event":"10/15/2007 09:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.813712,+-96.676099(9320)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9320) map </A>","Summary":"Strange lights moving across the sky.","Longitude":"-96.676099","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9320","Log Number":"US-01282008-0010","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"40.813712","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9320.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9320.html"],"trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Lincoln","There was one other sighting in Lincoln on or around October 15th 2007"],"City":"Lincoln","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Nebraska","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"10/15/2007 09:15 UTC","Country":"United States"}
