On our way to the store we noticed lights in the sky. I thought it was fireworks. Then, I noticed that the lights were not disappearing. Instead they were moving across the sky. They were about 50-60 together. They were moving in a partner similar to the one birds move together when they migrate. I pulled over and got off the car. Many people did the same thing. I tried to record but my phone was not good enough. I stayed out the car seen the flying lights crossing the sky. Then, they all stopped on top of the town and two of them descended. I wanted to see where they were going but my mom got really nervous and asked me to go inside the car. We went to the store and when we drove home the objects were gone."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-11072013-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52074.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52074.html"],"Summary":"flying objects in the sky (like balls)","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.673307","Source":"MUFON"}
