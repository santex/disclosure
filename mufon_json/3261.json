{"divs":["Sighting DetailsSighting Report: This sighting happenned approx one month ago. I was driving down the \"T\" road towards Crestone. This road directly faces the Sangre de Cristo mountains. I saw what appeared to be a single large light hovering over the Sangres. This light was larger than anything I ve ever witnessed. It \"split\" into 3 lights, one in the middle and one on either side, equal-distant from each other. Duration of sighting was approx 2 minutes. The lights \"merged\" back into a single point and was gone. None of the lights were observed to be moving away...they just were here now and then gone."],"Longitude":"-105.699733","Region":"Colorado","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Crestone","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"3261","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.996388,+-105.699733(3261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3261) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/27/2005 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Crestone","There were no other sightings in Crestone on or around February 27th 2005"],"Log Number":"","Latitude":"37.996388","Date of the Event":"02/27/2005 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3261.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3261.html"],"Summary":"Not Provided","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
