At first my attention was on our sesecurity lights on sides of our home to better see snow flakes. I then turned my attention to the horrizon. It is very cloudy and dark out. I then saw a bright red light size of a basketball floating downward. It must have been enormous up close. Lately I have been having a lot of interesting happeni.gs. So today I prayed about it all and was feeli.g optimistic for the first time in awhiile. Kinda blew my mind and made me upset."],"Summary":"Bright red light falling on SE horizon","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-84.868582","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
