Hovering maybe 100 feet directly over the trees was a brilliant, shiny gold disc against a beautiful, cloud-free blue sky. I observed it for around one minute, all the while it made no sound and emitted no exhaust. No markings were observable. I slowly backed up towards the front door where I knew my mother was inside. I had this strange feeling that it was watching me watch it. My uppermost thought was to let my mom know so she could see also see it. I backed up until I was at the foot of the front porch stairs (about 4 stairs). In less than 2 seconds I had sprung up the stairs, yanked open the screen door and yelled to mom to come outside as there was a UFO to be seen. I turned my head to the left and the disc was gone. There was not a sign in the sky such as contrail or quickly diminishing object. It wasn't until 10 or 15 years later that it occurred to me that its quickest means of disappearance was to simply land."],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"11762","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Georgia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.454203,+-83.502477(11762)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11762) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07262008-0020","Latitude":"31.454203"}
