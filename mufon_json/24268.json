It was silent and flew NW from Austin right over Butler Park as we were watching fireworks. Other people saw this object and yelled out a UFO. We looked up and were freaked out by what we saw. This object was traveling slow across the sky. About the speed of a 2 seater plane or slower. It was low enough that i could see the bottom of this circular craft changing colors like burning amber. I watched it disappear on the horizon but it reappear for a split second then was gone again, almost as if it had gone through a cloud and out again. But this object did not have any blinking or running lights on it. It definitely was not a plane, hot air balloon, firework, crashing satellite, or a star. This craft seemed to be under some kind of control and it just kept the same speed and elevation and flew in a straight line NW on the 4 of July at 9:35pm central time."],"Longitude":"-97.733341","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were 2 other sightings in Austin on or around July 4th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-07062010-0019","Summary":"Glowing red circular object like hot metal or burning amber.","Latitude":"30.273343","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 09:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.273343,+-97.733341(24268)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24268) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 10:08 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
