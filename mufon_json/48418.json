We both saw a bright blue white object moving south east. There was no sound. We could see other aircraft near by to compare the object to. I was in the Civil Air Patrol and could clearly see this was not an aircraft. This was not landing lights, I know the difference between landing lights and what we saw. The light pulsed becoming darker blue, there seemed to be a distortion in the light then it just blinked out. I checked and could not find a satellite on the internet that could account for what we saw. This was not a meteor or at least it did not have a tail nor did it descend at an angle as I have witnessed meteors before. Not sure what was but it was not Venus, Mars or swamp gas. My real hope was it was simply a satellite."],"Longitude":"-75.517601","Date Submitted":"06/25/2013 08:44 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Maryland","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.384193,+-75.517601(48418)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48418) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/24/2013 09:25 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.384193","Log Number":"US-06252013-0013","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
