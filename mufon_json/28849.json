One of the objects accelerated quickly crossing a valley between to mountains distance of at least 20 miles in about 1 second the other object moved slowly and hovered for a few minutes. The other object slowly started moving west until its view was obstructed by mountains. If I had to guess the altitude of the object I would have to say was about 15,000 to 20,000 ft. I was able to get a photo and video of the slower moving object seeing as it took a five minutes to cross the valley in which we were located. My internet connection is too slow to support the upload of the video seeing as I am currently in Afghanistan. The second object was witnessed by many people who were in the area and curious about what I was looking up at. I work in close proximity to a flight line and this object was not a conventional commercial or military aircraft in any way."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Two star like metalic objects sighted in broad daylight with many eye witnesses.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere, Star-like","Latitude":"34.938648","Case Number":"28849","Source":"MUFON"}
