Was really huge!It was 1967, me and my friend were talking and listening music, sitting on the bed.It was probably 4 PM. Than I moved to Santos Beach -Brasil-and saw once more- with many people in the beach-who stopped theirs cars to watch.IT stopped over a little island in front of the beach, I was with my ex husband and my too young children.It was full of colourful lights blimping and oval too-was 1982 -I repeat many people saw at that time, was unbeliveable.My ex husband wanted to go with children to watch the beach at night , and we went driving his car , with was probably 8 or 9 PM Than another time in Brazil last year-2007, my husband now, was visiting me , and suddenly I went to watch by the window and was a circle object , blimping and moving, stay there more than 10 minutes, over some homes farway my apartment, it was 9 or 9:30, my husband saw too but despite the object was moving and blipping, he told was a light from some antena!!!! Now I marryed on december 2007 , and live here for 5 months and I saw many times again, here in South Lyon, coming back to Port Huron 3 weeks ago , while we were in the car, was a huge light , circle and I saw for more than 10 minutes.It was 6:00PM-I didnt tell my husband and didnt show for him too. But the lasting days I waked up always 3AM , like something was telling me to go to watch the window bathroom and there was one again, is a strong light , circle and making many circle movements up and down for more than 10 minutes and another one like a fireball and simply disappears.Yesterday 1st April, happened again the same -at the window bathroom and I watch then by the sunroom window and saw a very dark image -isnt making any noise- was very scary, but didnt waked up my husband , and for my surprise this morning I saw our heater- we put woods inside to warm the patio, was opened- it is made by iron and heavy -we didnt listening any noise but was openned!!! In this morning my husband didnt believe, but the heater was open- what is amazed because it has a format of tradiditional UFOS- oval -really llok like a small UFO. Im scary really and dont have any normal explanation about that."],"City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04022008-0003","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States"}
