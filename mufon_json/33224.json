immediately and without any doubt in either of our minds (both being through and through ufo\\et believers, myself having researched and been exposed to it my life) ruled out that it was any type or plane\\aircraft reflecting the sun, due to it shape, size, brightness, location and at first what seemed like to be stationary! the more we drove towards it (even though it would have been at least 3-5k away, over the adelaide hills\\cbd direction) we noticed it was also moving\\hovvering very slowly to our left! the change in the \"reflection\" or ligh sorce was making it also obvious that it itself was moving, as we were also driving in a forward straight direction! we both ruled out a number of things it would possibly be just due to its location and shape and the biggest fact of all, in my best friends 29 years of living in this general location\\area and driving a countless amount of times down this section of highway in nearly all times of the day and night, and myself also for many years, had never ever seen even something vagely resembling or comparing to this, leaving us both heart body mind and soul agreeing that is was a ufo of some kind! as we drove further along the road, reaching our slight right hand turn off, stopping at the lights (turn off of port wakefield onto sailsbury highway) as i ducked down to look through the car stopped infront of us' windscreen to watch part of it slowly go behind the very tip of a tree top, i got the feeling\\thought come over me as i watched the colours of it have a slight blue tinge (even tho it was extremely bright, like a reflection, which is the best word i can use to discribe it, even though there is nothing in that area\\location\\height that would reflect sunlight, plus it was in the east-south easterly direction, and the sun was not fully centre sky but still slightly westerly), that what i was looking at was light being projected outwards, not reflecting, but it gave such a luminous, bright, sharp, glare like a reflection which as ive said many times now, it just could not have possibly been! we turned off onto sailsbury highway and lost sight of it due to the tree line right beside us, close by buildings\\factories and small sand\\land mounds\\hills. i continued nearly all he way to my appointment at marion, on the other side of adelaide(city) from where our trip started, looking and searching and almost jumping around in the car to get every possible direction covered to find out where it had gone\\which direction it may have still been in....but without any luck :( we both still remain adimate in our belief of what it was, if only souly for the fact that nothing even minutely close has been seen where this ufo\\object was witnessed. even after explaining the story to my mother, a 30year + ufo\\et\\truth researcher, and former ufo research network member who recieved and documented phoned in sightings for many years, also a current member of many ufo groups - aura, auforn etc, could not give me any other explaination or answer, she was also suprised\\shocked\\excited and amazed! there have been many recent ufo sightings and acitivly in south aust, or people are finally starting to speak up again at least! also we have just experienced a heavy 5 day haarp wave period, leaving the usual suspect clouds and skies and bringing in the random weather change! weither or not all of this is somehow connected, i do not know, but what i do know is the closer we approch some very signifigant and import times for us humanbeings (especially our higher\\inner\\astral selvs) the more n more strange events keep happening!"],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"138.604855","Latitude":"-34.921366","Region":"South Australia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-34.921366,+138.604855(33224)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33224) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Extremely bright, reflective type object, slowly hovering in clear view on horizon by tree tops, never anything close to resembling it seen in area/location before!","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"11/09/2011 01:39 UTC"}
