I turned around after seeing the look of shock on my friends face and saw a low flying aircraft that was oval shaped. i was in to much shock myself to think of what it was at the time my brain couldnt process it. It wasn���t flying very fast maybe about 15mph. It was flying right above the tree line. It was silverfish with 4 lights, 3 white ones and 1 flashing red one. It was unlike anything I���ve ever seen or heard and I can���t think of what else it could be. Me and my friend were in disbelief and shock at first but then reality hit us and it felt lik ewe were both going to cry for some reason."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24803.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24803.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Case Number":"24803","Object Shape":"Oval","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"41.607222","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:01:40","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.607222,+-81.050556(24803)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24803) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07272010-0027","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Montville"}
