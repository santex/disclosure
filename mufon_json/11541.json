As we continued to drive and follow the object we noticed an array of triangle shaped lights off in the distance...almost to where the meteor like object was heading. As the meteor objects faded into the distance, toward the horizon, the triangle formation of lights scattered very quickly in random like directions. As I turned onto a street heading toward the direction of the lights in the sky they were gone and the whole thing was over. We later, after the softball game, were listening to a local Chicago radio station, 96.3 FM, and heard people call into the station and tell the DJ (on air) that they had seen the lights or UFO's as well. This occurred between 8:45-9PM on Friday July 11th, 2008 near the town of Lansing, IL."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11541.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11541.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"11541","Date of the Event":"07/11/2008 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.564758","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Longitude":"-87.538931","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lansing","There were no other sightings in Lansing on or around July 11th 2008"]}
