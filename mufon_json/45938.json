{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Quebec","divs":["Sighting DetailsI always said ������ I wish I can see at least one -ufo- before I dye ������, and the funny thing, even that a few days after the event I actually told some one about what I saw, it took a while for me to actually accept that I did see a ufo.. I guess it was so natural that it did not register as a sighting, and only tonight, several months after the occurrence that I came up with the idea to report it. I���m French Canadian from Qu���bec so my wording might lead to questioning..or laughing.. ;) So��� first I must say that I have been a remote model airplane pilot for about 23 years, I recently move back from Ontario to Quebec. As you might guess the sighting occurred at my flying field, the club name is Amidair.. As my type of flying ������������ a mix of 3D and precision������������ require steady concentration I prefer to fly alone, so I usually get to the field very��� early 05:45 get set up and usually do several flight in a row before the crowd gets there. That morning the sky had several patches of gray clouds and I was doing my usual bag of tricks with my plane, and after I did a rolling circle I notice that some thing was occupying a previous empty spot in the shy at around 2 o���clock, honestly, I must admit that I had the feeling of being watch.. I also had the feeling that it was closer to me then the other clouds, we all know that doing a distance evaluation of object in the sky is very difficult since there is no point of reference, as a remote RC pilot like me, it���s some thing you learn the hard way as you think that your plane is in front of the three just to see it disappear in the back of it.. So, I���m flying my plane and with time my brain send me a few red flag so I get really interested and I want to take a good look at it so I go in an easy flying mode, doing some long and slow climbing that give me a few good five second to stare at it. The more I look at it the greater my interest grew and the harder it was to fly my plane.. The shape was very surreal, basically it had a center point with 3 long point sticking out, if I remember well one was at 12 o���clock one at 4 oc and one at 8 oc. The surreal part was that it was camouflage like the other cloud with a wad of cloud around the spike and center mass so I never saw any metal or hard surfaces just a 3 spoke cloud��� now I remember thinking ������ that���s the proof.. 3 point clouds don���t exist.. so I kept flying in a survival mode so I could keep my eyes on it up to the time that it did start ������ I guess������ to move away from me, I say I guess��� because with the same outside look, it just shrink smaller and smaller. So if it was going away from me it must have done it in a very.. straight line with me, if it did, that denote some intelligence that it knew that I was looking at it and try to confuse me by not having a lateral movement, I looked at it until it totally disappear then I scan the sky for a moving object, I do think that I saw some thing reflecting the sun doing a small curve but I���m not sure.. After that, while I was still flying my remote plane, 2 big 747 did a very��� low fly by right over my head, it seam that they where coming from a take off from the Mirabel airport that is fairly close to my flying field.. They both appear in front of me at a good distance going left to right did a long u turn, came over my head, they where so low that I got uncomfortable flying my plane.. the first pass was right over my flying field the second was a bit wider to my back.. I���ve been a member of this club for a few years now, we see our fare share of plane passing over our field on approach to Mirabel airport, we have what I call the FedEx express that come in like a clock in the morning, We also see a special 4 engine plane with a turbine engine, strap to the right or the cockpit , for engine testing purposes I guess, but never I saw a 747 or two for the matter at such a low altitude.. What crossed my mind for the 747 is that the government is doing some monitoring on ufo, that seems to have.. from what I can read, a weakness for airport traffic.. So there you go.. I now can dye happy because I finally saw one���too bad it took me so long to realize it.."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"45.787082","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Saint-Jérôme","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.787082,+-74.020733(45938)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45938) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-74.020733","Date Submitted":"02/27/2013 12:49 UTC","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45938.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-02272013-0007","City":"Saint-JÃÂ©rÃÂ´me","Case Number":"45938","Summary":"being observed by a 3 points star under a camouflage or mist/cloud."}
