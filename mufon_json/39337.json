{"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Fort Myers","divs":["Sighting DetailsI & my brother had arrived in the Riverdale wynn dixie parking lot & I spotted a very large cone shaped trail or cone of light looking like it started on the East coast & continued across the sky into the clouds in the west. It had dark streaks beside each light edge delineated by another looks like residual light beams outside the cone. We took pics & a short movie of this incident. I know this was NOT light coming through the clouds due to the fact the sun was almost down & behind the stormclouds. To my knowledge light doesn't come from diffuse & focus to a point across the state. Homestead is approx. where it terminated or originated.There is a large gridpoint there as Coral Castle is located there for a purpose only Ed Leedscalnin know. Anyway I have seen other strange occurances here & this is the latest Thanks for reading."],"trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Fort Myers","There was one other sighting in Fort Myers on or around June 13th 2012"],"Case Number":"39337","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.83043","Summary":"Giant cone of light similar to jet wash but all the way across the sky","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"26.666263","Log Number":"US-06142012-0008","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.666263,+-81.83043(39337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39337) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/13/2012 06:01 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cone, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date Submitted":"06/14/2012 11:23 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39337.html"]}
