{"Case Number":"22778","Date Submitted":"04/12/2010 02:19 UTC","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsSince the 5th of April I've watched Blackhawks hover over our neighborhood for 15- to 20 minutes at a time, and this has gone on for days mostly in the early evening hours now Nellis AFB is to the North of Las vegas. What makes this odd is the military follows flight patterns and only flies in certain areas also saw to F22's fly right under a commercial jet it was strange then the other night it sounded like the blackhawks where back and when I went outside to get a better look I was stunned to see it was actually a Chinook. What the hell are they up to?? I mean I've lived here for 35 years and they just don't do things like this so why now??"],"Latitude":"36.118746","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04122010-0014","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around April 5th 2010"],"Longitude":"-115.165006","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/05/2010 02:00 UTC","Summary":"Military very active flying over city area's","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22778.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22778.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","City":"Las Vegas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Nevada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.118746,+-115.165006(22778)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22778) map </A>"}
