It was sunny and few clouds in the sky, I thought it was a plane but then I focused on the object and I could tell that it was moving fast and there was no wings like that of an airplane. I looked forward onto the road and looked up few seconds later and could not spot it again. It was oval and chrome to silver like color."],"Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Warden","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval"}
