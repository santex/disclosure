(ie: pick a spot on the sky hold your arm and hand out to mark it with your finger - then measure about 6\" from your pointing finger away from the original spot) at one point it completely faded out, and faded back in reappearing about another relative 6\" away - but almost instantly. this process was repeated intermittently a few times. it travelled from high mid sky facing west (about 70 degrees from horizon) to almost disappearing over the horizon within about a 30 minute period. when it began to get nearer to the horizon from my vantage point, the colors began to slowly (yet rapidly enough to notice) fade from whitish-amber to oranges, reds, and randomly between these colors. i'm hoping there will turn up some other reports and hopefully footage from others. i'm going to try and post this on some of the other ufo sighting reports websites. i'm currently downloading video footage from my digital camera. it was at night w\\ a consumer camera - so i'm not hopeful... especially after seeing the still image. i'll attach the untouched still that i took once it was near the horizon and flashing colors. of course it's night with no tripod - so it's the typical snakey\\curly light trails pic - ie: useless. [descrip: there is grass\\field at bottom, then telephone pole... and the orangy\\reddy light trail thing is what resulted from the camera when aimed at the color changing sphere on the horizon] i mainly wanted to log this so when other reports turn up, it will be good to have for cross referencing."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"13182","Latitude":"37.334308","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Bedford","There were no other sightings in Bedford on or around October 22nd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"10/22/2008 06:33 UTC"}
