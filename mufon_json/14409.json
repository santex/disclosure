NO SURPRISE SOMEONE FROM CALIFORNIA JUST PUT UP A REPORT OF EXACTLY WHAT I SAW. ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND WERE UP TILL 4:30 AM WATCHING THESE LOW DROPPING OBJECTS. THIS IS NOT THE 1ST TIME I HAVE SEEN CRAFTS ABOVE THE KILL VAN KULL. OUT OF ALL THE CRAFTS, THE MOST MEMORABLE WAS A FIREY DISC THAT SHOT ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRANGE WOBBLING MOTION. SOME CRAFTS WERE ALSO NOT LIT UP, BUT YOU SEEN THEM WITH THE MOON LIGHT REFLECTION, DANCING AND PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER LIKE KIDS. VERY PEACEFUL DISPLAY IN THEIR AERIAL ACROBATICS. SINCE I WAS I CHILD I SEEN CRAFTS OF ALL KINDS. lAST NIGHT WAS SOMTHING SURREAL."]}
