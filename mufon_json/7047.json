{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"7047","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.21686","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving up to my parent���s house in north GA from Atlanta, having left at 11:50pm Friday night. I was nearing my destination after 90 minutes of driving, having long exited the highway (Hwy 515). Driving on Aska road about one mile before reaching Newport road, I saw two cars parked on the opposite shoulder with their lights on and their drivers standing a few yards from them on the edge of a dirt lot. Aska is a long, winding road in a very remote part of GA and it is unusual to see any traffic after 10pm. I thought one of the drivers may have been having car trouble, or collided with the other driver. I slowed to take a closer look at the scene and saw both drivers staring to the sky above a hilltop that was about half a mile away. Above the hill, maybe 300 ft. in the air were a string of 12 or so bright amber lights arranged into a crescent with a very shallow curve. I first thought them to be airplanes flying in formation. I did not see the lights moving, however, and I also stopped my car and rolled down my window to get a clear view of the lights. I did not see stars behind the general patch of sky occupied by the lights and realized I was staring at a single solid object with lights spaced along its leading edge. I exited my car and joined the other drivers on the dirt lot and asked them what it was. Neither knew, but the first driver to arrive said he had been looking at it for 5 minutes already before I arrived. The three of us traded theories about what we were looking at, finally deciding that it was most likely some kind of blimp. We all agreed it was strange that it wasn't moving at all. 15 minutes after first noticing the object, it began descending straight down and quickly disappeared behind the hilltop. It covered this distance in no more than 3 seconds. The other two drivers were surprised by this but did not seem concerned or frightened. I felt quite afraid at that point and immediately returned to my car and sped the rest of the way to my parents home. I looked for mention of the object in the local newspaper for the next two weeks and found nothing."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Date Submitted":"05/05/2007 01:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dial","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"Wide, shallow crescent approx. 50ft across with 12 or so bright amber lights on its leading edge.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.759808,+-84.21686(7047)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7047) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"05/05/2007 01:30 UTC","Region":"Georgia","Log Number":"US-05202007-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7047.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7047.html"],"City":"Dial","Latitude":"34.759808"}
