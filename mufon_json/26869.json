I had a full view no obstructions.After about 14 minutes a smaller light appared from the bottom and moved away toward the north to milwaukee. it traveled at a very fast rate and then went out of view. the star looking craft is still outside and has not moved except for zigzagging and changing altitude. is has went nearly dim but it seems to be waiting for the smaller light to return maybe i dont know.Just checked and my sister is watching it with me trying to get my camcorder to film it.it is bobbing up and down still and seems to be rotating colors around it. waiting for the smaller craft if it does come back."],"Summary":"Appeared as a bright star then it started wobbling","Log Number":"US-12062010-0001","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"01:22:26","Date Submitted":"12/06/2010 12:31 UTC","Latitude":"42.684923","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"12/05/2010 11:19 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Burlington","There were no other sightings in Burlington on or around December 5th 2010"],"Case Number":"26869","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26869.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26869.html"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Wisconsin","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.684923,+-88.275013(26869)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26869) map </A>","City":"Burlington"}
