We were at a light when I couldn't help but look at this shining orange ball in the sky that was lower than what helicopters would normally be and it obviously wasn't a plane. We drive towards it and its moving along side as we are driving. We were doing 35-40m.p.h. It would blink sometimes and even change white a few times as well. We had to make a left but were so amazed at this orange ball we turned around and drove back towards it. We caught a light again but we could see the orange ball which was now moving towards the direction we just turned around from meaning it also made a left. It stopped, blinked and shot off forward into the sky. Right after it disappeared another one appeared in the sky. It flew over to where the other one left and disappeared as well. These were low enough to know that they weren't normal. I have never seen anything like this before. I live in M.I. They resemble the orange freeway lights we have here on 696,Southfield freeway e.t.c."],"Date of the Event":"09/11/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.49275,+-83.137038(42510)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42510) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Royal Oak","There were no other sightings in Royal Oak on or around September 11th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"09/12/2012 08:38 UTC","Latitude":"42.49275","City":"Royal Oak","Source":"MUFON"}
