( no blinking lights, did not blink, just brilliant ( flickering ? ) bright orange \\ amber light... like a huge star ) it started to arc toward the east and then started shrinking \\ dimming... until it looked like a dot in the sky, without any light... and then it was gone. vanished !!! just like the first one did. we waited to see if another one would appear, but did not see anything, so we ran home with our dog and told my husband what we had seen. he asked us to show him where we had seen it ( all the while making fun of us ), so we ( my husband, son, dog and i )went back outside, and my husband noticed a star-like ( slightly larger than a large star ) moving object, up in the sky, moving from west to east. when he pointed it out to me, i told him it was the same color, but much, much smaller ( farther away ). my husband is a major skeptic ( engineer ), but he did take a picture with his cell phone camera ( yet to see the pic ). he also did make the remark that the color was unusual, and he did not believe it was an airplane or a helicopter. he also said he had never seen anything like it. i told him that what he was seeing was sooooo much smaller ( farther away ), that it was not as shocking as the first two that my son and i had witnessed. we ended up losing sight of this \"far away\" one, so my husband did not see it shrink \\ dim out and disappear, but at least he did see the orange \\ amber color of it. we then took him to the exact spot that the first two appeared at. we did not see them again. this was a very strange sighting that my son and i will never forget !!! if there is anyone else in the canton, mi area that has also witnessed this \\these u.f.o.s, please feel free to contact me."],"Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Summary":"Canton, MI - Large Star-Like Orange/Amber U.F.O. shrinking / dimming / vanishing...","Longitude":"-83.479056","Log Number":"US-09132011-0008","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31787.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31787.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Canton","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Canton","There was one other sighting in Canton on or around September 11th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"09/13/2011 11:53 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"31787","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.314084,+-83.479056(31787)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31787) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Date of the Event":"09/11/2011 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"42.314084"}
