Where we hunt you have to pack in everything you need, so we had no tent. We were at about 11,000 feet. Somthing had kicked dirt into my sleeping bag. I noticed that the ground was quite bright, brighter than day light. I sat up to see what it was, and noticed the light was coming from above. I tried to wake my dad, but could not speak or move. I sat there for what seemed to be an hour, but not sure how long. There was no sound, or wind. I was with my dad, cousin, and his dog, and they did not notice anthing in the night. We had horses, and mules, and they made no noise. In the morning I saw no signs of any of this, and we finished hunting. Now I know I have a vivid amagination, but I do not think I was dreaming. Not sure what happened, but it was real to me, and I remember it like it was yesterday. There are no roads, or electricity there."],"Log Number":"US-08202011-0005","Longitude":"-108.277326","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Silver City","There were no other sightings in Silver City on or around February 28th 1990"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.776065,+-108.277326(31033)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31033) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"31033","Disposition":"Hoax","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31033.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31033.html"],"Region":"New Mexico","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/28/1990 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/20/2011 03:20 UTC"}
