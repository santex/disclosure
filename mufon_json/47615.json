{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-87.173126","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy girlfriend and I were on our way to Walmart approximately at 11 p.m. last year on April 6th when we noticed an extremely bright light northwest of us. We decided to drive across the street to get a closer view and parked. Two pictures were taken of the same object about a moment apart. One photo shows the light, from outside the driver side window although it was way brighter upon seeing, in fact, it was the brightest light in the sky that night by far. The other picture was taken outside the passenger side window of the same object but shows two objects which we did not see. The object was very extraordinary in that it was extremely low and extremely bright. The object remained stationary. About 5 - 10 minutes after viewing the object from the parking spot, we decided to try to get closer to it. As we went driving, we could no longer see it. When we returned about 10 minutes later to the same location that we were before, it was gone. The second photo was cropped to get a closer view of the two objects."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Portage","There were no other sightings in Portage on or around April 6th 2012"],"Latitude":"41.578621","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/06/2012 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47615.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47615.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"05/24/2013 04:06 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.578621,+-87.173126(47615)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47615) map </A>","City":"Portage","Case Number":"47615","Log Number":"US-05242013-0010","Object Shape":"Fireball","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"object(s) extremely bright, photgraphed, stationary."}
