The object was over my head, very bright....was not a plane; boomerang, almost glowing. Yes, it sounds weird but I know what I saw. I'm sure someone one else had to have seen this in the area. It was moving fast then just disapeared from sight. I just stood there looking up at the sky in disbelief."],"Country":"United States"}
