{"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I saw a really round disk flyin bout 5 miles offshore do a pretzely loopty loop n dissappear.","City":"San Francisco","Latitude":"37.78291","Case Number":"6989","divs":["sighting detailsi was at the marin headlands right above the golden gate bridge on the marin side, at the first main pullout\\ lookout area. i was lookin out over the ocean towards the farallons, and i seriously saw an almost-circular object floating maybe a few football fields high over the ocean. suddenly this weird oval object flew in an irregular looping shape that seemed to switch directions in middair as if it completely defied gravity (or at least it was utterly unlike the common manner in which we usually see things fly). i was really amazed. the experience only lasted a handful of seconds, it was totally unexpected and unprecedented in my life. i told a girlfriend months later and she said she'd seen one or two over the bay area (the opposite direction from where the one i saw was) and had met someone up there that was tracking them. i'm writing this years later because i know i saw something few people ever see and that beyond a shadow of a doubt there was some sort of ufo out there. i canot vouch for my ex though... however i included her story because i think that area may actually be a good spot to see ufo's from cuz it was so weird she said she'd seen some there too.. the shape was far rounder than most ufo's are generally described as being in the media i've seen. i want to learn more about this phenomenon. ps near that time i had a weird creepy feeling one night and snapped to full alertness with the disgusting perception of a big nasty grey alien in my head. i was revolted by it and directed my will at it to get away from me immediately. it never happened again, but it was so creepy, and i wonder if the two events were connected. it was like some spectator in my head. i wondered after if i was meant to see the ufo. i won't lie that i have extra sensory gifts that have persisted for almost two decades. though i care if it discredits the ufo sighting, i want people to know there are luminaries, i have seen a gpld spirit shape at mt. shasta and a jade green orb in my shower after lots of meditation, but that stuff is separate from the ufo phenomena except it works at certain levels of the mind like perhaps these aliens are capable of. i do have a gift though, i have had verified precognitive dreams and also called the sex and age of a ghost in my old house ( a person of same sex and age was later found to have been murdered while leiving in that house. i know when i am passing through a town where there has been an indian battle etc. also i believe in elementals because one once clothed itself in clouds and appeared to me as a beautiful maiden who morphed into a screaming hideous death-face; she was as plain as day and any picture. back to the alien sighting in my mind... maybe it was just a bad dream to help me make peace with having seen the ufo however. but i felt it and it felt nasty. anyway, that is my testimony, and so help me god it is true from the bottom of my heart. the ufo faded out\\dissappeared actually. i had a dream that magnetics and philosophy were the pillars of the ancients. i want to learn more about them because man there is something out there that has a knowledge of them that certainly exceeds ours. i am good with the i ching too, i get intuitions, once a weirdo talked directly into my mind. i rounded the corner and i just saw him smiling in my face but it was in my mind and he was actually a guy fifty feet away sitting on the street of the parking lot. i was on my way to work. he then asked me (normally) where the movie theatre was and somehow i knew he knew so i said \"don't you know and he said yes it is on 4th between a and b and i, surprised and baffled said \" yes it is on 4th between a and b.\"and he said but i do not know where that is, and i said go down one block and over five, and he said, right into my mind \"you are very kind\" i was so confused because i had bever stopped walking and i was like fifty feet away from him when i heard him say i at that time was himalaya, and in retrospect he must have been a tibetan lama, although i was admittedly reading herman hesse and had been praying to abraxas monents before this happened."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05082007-0003","Longitude":"-122.414456","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78291,+-122.414456(6989)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6989) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6989.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6989.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were no other sightings in San Francisco on or around May 25th 2003"],"Date Submitted":"05/25/2003 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/25/2003 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
