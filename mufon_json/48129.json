It was a clear night, no clouds and I could make out several star formations which are normally seen, when I started to notice 4 star like objects were blinking, first one then another. This kept up quite a few minutes and as I was watching, another object off to the left just shot straight up leaving a tail for an inch or so (white light) then just disappeared. I was happy to see these as I had recently read Dr. Steven Greer's books and watched his dvd and what I saw was very much like what he showed on the dvd and I was thinking...wow, guess you don't have to be in the mountains in CO to see activity if you look for it. I didn't lose sight of the other 4 star like objects, just got tired of watching and went to bed."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fenwick","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
