{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","divs":["Sighting DetailsI'm visiting my Sister in Maryland , I went out on the back deck for a smoke at 10:45 . And happened to glance up at the sky . Coming across and traveling south-southeast , was a square object with white lights in each corner and a flashing red strobe in the center . The height of the object was around 2,000 feet , moving slow and emitting no sound . There was no other air traffic in the sky , and it was a quite night . Even with the aircraft that passes overhead you can here the motors or the jet engines at almost any altitude . I had the object in view for about 2 minutes till I lost it behind some trees . At that height the object looked to be about an inch square or a little bigger when it was closer to me . Sure would like to know if anyone else saw this object . I did try to take a pic of it with my cell phone but all I got from the viewer was grey ."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date Submitted":"07/03/2010 09:34 UTC","Case Number":"24113","Region":"Maryland","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around July 2nd 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-77.039848","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"38.99728","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.99728,+-77.039848(24113)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24113) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24113.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24113.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/02/2010 10:45 UTC","City":"Washington","Summary":"Square object with lights in the corners.","Log Number":"US-07032010-0018","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
