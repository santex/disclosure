FBI? or CIA? 27 AUG 08 I was leaving work around 12:25 pm, 27 Aug 08, Ellington Fld, Houston, TX-- I was going home to evacuating from hurricane Gustav. I notice the object, as I was at the top of I-45 over pass going south towards Pearland, TX. I slowed down to get a closer looked at this object- it was suspended 12��� to 14��� above Dixie Farm Rd. I looked for cables or something that it could be hanging from, but nothing, it was stationary in sky on its own. I drove under it and kept going. I looked in my rear view mirror and it was still there, I know, I was not the only one that saw this object. The sky was clear ������Blue Bird Day���, something came over me- (Traumatized), I carry a camera with me all the time, which, I use with my job. It���s funny; I never thought about stopping and calling 911 or take a photo of the object. When, I first saw this object, it looked like a surveillance probe; cylinder with dark windows around the top, the object was 4 to 5 feet in length, approx 12inches in diameter. I heard about UFO Probes before, when, I got home I told my wife about what I had saw. The sky was so clear it would have made a great clear photo��� I called my brother-n-law and told him what I had seen. He said he saw something like this on Discovery Channel... that the FBI and CIA...might have��� The object was stationary in a vertical stance and never moved-NO NOISE- cylinder with dark windows around the top, the object was 3 to 4 feet in length, approx 12 inches in diameter. This photo is the area where the probe was seen and the photo of the probe is one that I made on Photo-shop to show what I saw. This is not the original photo of the probe���but it is of the location."],"trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were 2 other sightings in Houston on or around August 28th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"29.579575","Longitude":"-95.120974","Log Number":"US-04142011-0013"}
