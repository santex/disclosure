I just ate dinner at a roadside restaurant I looked up and saw 3 triangler UFOS they were purple lighted with red dots on the corners they were a very bright purple. They hovered over the car and where I was at they were going east and I watched them as they hovered over the area. Then they emitted blue and orange beams. And then they were yellow lighted with red dots on the corners. Then all 3 of the UFOS landed in a nearby field. So I drove down to look and they were a bunch of crows flying around the area where they landed and I found metal in the area where they landed. Then I went back to the motel I was at and I saw no more UFOS. It was partly cloudy that night the UFOS I saw were going east when they disappeared and landed."],"Latitude":"41.03006","Date Submitted":"12/22/2005 07:40 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/22/2005 07:40 UTC"}
