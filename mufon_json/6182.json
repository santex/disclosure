{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI remember the time and date of this event so well because it happened on the date of the Live-Aid concert and I was rushing home to see Led Zeppelin perform. I was in my friends car and we were dropping off a friend of ours at her house. For some reason we all got out of the car when we arrived at her home and talked a bit. Just as we were getting ready to return to the auto iI looked up after I had seen something out of the corner of my eye. I looked up and noticed a weird object flying from west to east in the sky. I froze in my tracks and brought it to the attention of my friend Allen who was driving. He looked up and saw it too. It was hard to tell how far away it was and thus so equaly diffacult to judge it's size. The frame of refrence that I used was the size of the 5 large white lights shaped like a V underneath the craft. One light front and center with two more on each of the lenghts that made up the V. My estimates are that the object was about 60 to 80 feet long and about 4 or 5 hundred feet in the air."],"Summary":"Chevron or V shaped object with 5-7 large white lights flies over head","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.919695","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01172007-0003","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/13/1985 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Chevron","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.919695,+-74.169981(6182)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6182) map </A>","City":"Paterson","Region":"New Jersey","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6182.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6182.html"],"Case Number":"6182","Longitude":"-74.169981","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/13/1985 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Paterson","There were no other sightings in Paterson on or around July 13th 1985"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
