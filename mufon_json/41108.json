Something told me to look east and I saw a strange triangle formation. The lights were not pulsing as regular military nor commercial aircraft. This area is common to have a lot of military crafts in the air, however the sky is clear of them tonight. Only these 3 strange orbs that rapidly pulse and then slow down. They kept changing from a triangular formation to a diagonal line. Every time I thought they were coming closer they would quickly move away east of my position. My cellphone, wireless internet and satelight television are also having disruptions."],"Case Number":"41108","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667127,+-81.511754(41108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41108) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07242012-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
