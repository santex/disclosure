{"Case Number":"47298","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out in the mid summer, looking at the stars, and I saw something that all the sudden, I thought maybe, it was a satellite. But now, I realize, if a satellite was to be going that fast, it would probably burn up. It was clearly up around 36,000 feet, and I saw lights... It wouldn't have been an aircraft, because of all the colors, and the sort of aurora that it seemed to trail. I would watch it, and then think, I had no idea satellites could go that fast. The object started to move to the right, and then it moved back into its pattern. It's colors were listed above, and I don't even know at this point if it should be counted as a sighting. I was 8 then, and I don't think I knew."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.733254,+-70.533445(47298)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47298) map </A>","Latitude":"43.733254","Longitude":"-70.533445","Summary":"Not a clear image, did not look like a satellite.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47298.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47298.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/15/2008 10:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Standish","There were no other sightings in Standish on or around June 15th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Maine","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Standish","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-05092013-0016","Date Submitted":"05/09/2013 08:46 UTC"}
