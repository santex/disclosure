At first when I saw it the object had circular colored lights under the square frame that were spinning. As it flew over me I saw that it was square and I could only see the four white lights. As it was approaching me I got a very uneasy feeling. I turned my back to it as I walked slowly and stood in a shadowed area where I was.I felt liked I was being watched,and felt my life was being threatened. I then watched it as it flew over Rayley's Feild, in W. Sacramento, Ca. and then it went behind some clouds and I did not see it again. I had seen circular and triangle UFO's before, but never a square. I notice around five minutes later a helicopter and two planes were following the same path as the UFO did."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-121.546766"}
