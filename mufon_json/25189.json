{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving down 44 E around Hampton Blvd. There was a cigar shaped object over the trees to my right, it was VERY shiny. Thought it was a plane but the maneuvers were very odd. First it was hovering still, then all of a sudden it started moving from the right to the left very fast, then it would drop down very fast, slow down again and slowly going away from me. What struck me was how shiny it was. Never seen anything that shiny. Also the size was pretty big, around the size of a c113. I was on the phone, and I was very amazed and could not tell what it was."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-90.190994","Date of the Event":"08/26/2010 02:15 UTC","Latitude":"38.635812","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in St Louis","There were no other sightings in St Louis on or around August 26th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"St Louis","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.635812,+-90.190994(25189)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25189) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Shiny cigar shape over St. Louis downtown.","Date Submitted":"08/26/2010 06:42 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08262010-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25189.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25189.html"],"Case Number":"25189","Object Shape":"Cigar","Tags":"City"}
