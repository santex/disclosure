I saw a multicolored belt of lights flashing sequentially from one side to the other and then back again. It hovered in place. At the same time, I saw the lights of a plane pass across my field of vision in front of the hovering object, so I knew it was definitely not a plane. The object, still hovering in the space place, began to slowly fade. It did not decrease in size as if it were moving away, but rather faded into black."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01302012-0018","Latitude":"36.076061","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around November 4th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
