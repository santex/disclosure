I saw one white orb shining brightly in the sky headed northwest. At first I thought it was a private airplane headed towards Joliet airport, but noticed it wasn���t changing latitude. As I was watching to see if this was a plane, I noticed two more bright white lights come on which made this craft look like an obtuse triangle. During the event, the craft did not seem to change direction and all three lights looked connected. Once the three lights were shining brightly, I woke my husband up and asked him to look outside. As he got up to look, only two of the lights were shining at this point. These two lights were the closer of the three and they stayed on for about ten more seconds. As my husband and I were watching the two white lights shining brightly in the sky, one went out and the other stayed on for about five more seconds and then disappeared."],"Case Number":"47628","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/25/2013 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05252013-0011","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47628.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47628.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.634625,+-89.388988(47628)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47628) map </A>","Latitude":"40.634625","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Summary":"Observied a bright white light over Joliet, IL that turned into 3 lights forming a triangle headed NW towards Plainfield, IL","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering"}
