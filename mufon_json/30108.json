{"Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was swimming at a friends apt, looked up in the southern sky. That's when I saw cigar shaped that also looked like a disc when it changed directions. I watched it move southeast for approximately 60 seconds. The object suddenly took off at an incredible speed. It was gone in an instant. I had no time to get out of the pool and photograph it. After I came home, I reported it to MUFON. Now, I do see a lot of planes in that area,but it was silent, no con trails,and did not look anything like a plane. I have also experienced visitation, but have difficulty remembering certain details."],"Log Number":"US-07102011-0025","Latitude":"31.976019","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30108.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30108.html"],"Summary":"I was swimming at a friends apt looked up and saw it.","Sighting Duration":"00:01:31","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc","Date Submitted":"07/10/2011 10:46 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/10/2011 07:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.976019,+-99.893413(30108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30108) map </A>","trends":[],"Case Number":"30108","Longitude":"-99.893413","Weather Factors":"None"}
