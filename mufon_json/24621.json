They were closing, so I decided to go home. It was 10:50 PM. Walking home I looked up behind me soon after I entered an open gate, which was a shortcut. When I look up behind me I saw a small white dot of light probably 6,000 feet high. Within a couple of seconds the dot of white light traveled almost straight down. When it got to the center of the street about 60 yards from me I realized it was a weird looking airplane. At first I thought it was going to crash in the middle of the street, but doing a nose dive it pulled up just in time. It was not going fast enough as I guess why it did not produce a sonic boom. It went almost straight up disappearing into space. It made no sound. When it was nearing the street I saw it clearly having 5 semi-circles on the backs of each of the side big wings. The wings were angled backward. Its tail wings were not unusual, as the rest of the plane looked like an ordinary plane. The semi-circles on the wings made the plane resemble or communicate something evil."],"Latitude":"33.838593","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24621.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24621.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/25/1992 09:50 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24621","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.838593,+-117.910004(24621)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24621) map </A>","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There were no other sightings in Anaheim on or around October 25th 1992"],"Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"00:00:25","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Anaheim","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.910004","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"An airplane with Vulcan type wings."}
