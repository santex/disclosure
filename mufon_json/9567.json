It was bright and sunny. I looked up above me into the blue, cloudless sky, and directly above me were three (3) lights circling one another - as if playing - very quickly. They then moved one by one in a direct line to the North - each one behind the other at roughly the same distance from one another and at the same speed. The distance above me was quite high and without any spacial reference it would be impossible to judge an accurate distance - except of course to say it was great. None-the-less, there were no wings to indicate an airplain or bird, and no helicopter can travel that quickly and accurately around another object. If you've ever watched flies swarm around one another you'll have a vague idea of the type of flight pattern they had. This is my first ever sighting - if it can be classified as that."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in San Fernando","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"California"}
