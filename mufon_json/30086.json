I was standing on the back patio when I seen a orange and yellow object in the sky to the south it was moving to the north. Then I seen the second one right behind it and a little to the east. I tried to call a friend but no answer. I went into the house to get a camera. This time I went out the front of the house. I couldn't get a pic they were to far away. Then I seen two more glowing balls to the south moving north. Not sure what they were never seen anything like it before. they looked like fireballs they seemed to be moving at a good rate of speed."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.540199,+-87.248135(30086)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30086) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-87.248135","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"30086","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.540199","Date of the Event":"07/09/2011 10:42 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Hobart","There were no other sightings in Hobart on or around July 9th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-07102011-0003","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"07/29/2011 05:40 UTC","City":"Hobart","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Summary":"Two sets of two glowing balls"}
