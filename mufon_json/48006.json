Being very curious, I stopped in the driveway and observed a group of objects traveling at a very slow speed from south toward north. As I watched, the dipper shape began to change and sevealr addition shapes started to appear to the south of the first grouping. I watched it travel across the sky for about 40 minutes and it started to fade out. I was able to capture a photo on my smartphone and have attached it. A very strange feeling indeed. Love to have some idea of what it could have been. I noticed on the internet several other people saw the same thing. Get's on to wondering.
