I quickly grabbed my HD camcorder and recorded this amazing event. After the 3 objects moved out of sight I turned off my camcorder. about 3 minutes later, another of the same objects came from the north traveled in the same exact path and vanished. this happened 2 more times which I also caught on camera. My stepson got chills, it was a very exciting thing to witness. Being that this was New Years eve, I at first thought that they could have been fireworks or flares, but after watching my video these were not fireworks or flares. These objects were obviously in sync with each other. Very amazing. We live in the Parkville MD. area."],"Date of the Event":"12/31/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like"}
