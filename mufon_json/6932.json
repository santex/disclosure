We stopped at a rest stop in Nevada a couple hours drive West of Las Vegas. The driver of the car, as well as two other witnesses observed a large unidentified flying object hovering over our location. It is difficult to estimate the elevation of the craft or its approximate size. It had no lights, nor other observable markings. The craft seemed to be \"invisible\" and what we observed was a dark object that silhouetted stars and such as it moved slowly almost hovering over our location. We observed the object for nearly a half hour, before becoming spooked and leaving the location."],"Summary":"Large unidentified object hovering over car","Region":"Nevada","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"05/01/1994 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"36.117776","Date of the Event":"05/01/1994 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-115.164726","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-04302007-0011","Source":"MUFON"}
