The light show began near ���Duster��� (highway 679 & 587). Prior to the light show I observed a very bright, large yellow star or satellite in appearance about 30 degrees above horizon and about 30 degrees south of highway 587. As far as the color and intensity of this large light, it could be compared to a rural farm light of the sodium vapor type. The large UFO light observed would be similar to the large size farm light viewed from a distance of about three miles. I noticed this large light in the eastern sky about 7:10 p.m. as I was driving toward it. I was approximately 20 miles west of DeLeon when I first observed the large, yellow light. As I was driving due east, I watched this light from time to time as it was so bright and large and it drew my attention. The light was positioned close to my rearview mirror so it was easy to keep an eye on it as I drove. Suddenly about 6 or 7 smaller lights, perhaps one-half the size of the bright light, appeared one-by-one to the left of the large light and remained lighted for a few seconds; then all of the small lights turned off simultaneously. These smaller lights were to the left of the bright light and turned on progressively in a south to north direction. These small lights turned on in sequence at about the rate of one per second. After the small lights had been gone for a few seconds, the same phenomenon happened a little closer to the bright light and south of the first set of small lights. Again, turning on progressively but this time from my left to my right, i.e. north to south. Again they all disappeared after all 7 or 8 were turned on for a few seconds; they all turned off simultaneously. Next, the same sequencing of small lights occurred again but the farthest away from the large light than either of the first two appearances. These lights were again to the north side of the big light. However, peculiar to this set of small lights, this time the last three or four lights turned on in what appeared to be a curved direction heading back to the south; again all small lights disappeared simultaneously. This string of lights came on in a south to north direction, just as did the first set of lights that I observed. Nothing reappeared for the next few minutes but I then noticed the large light began to get weaker until it was very dim and then disappeared completely. This noticeable dimming process lasted perhaps for 5 or 6 seconds. It is possible that this dimming effect was due to the large light moving directly away from me at an extremely high rate of speed. I traveled a short distance farther and pulled to the side of the road, turned off the motor and listened for any airplane noise; total silence. I took my field glasses out of the pickup in case the lights reappeared. There was no noise and nothing reappeared. I did not even observe stars at this time. This entire lighting exhibition lasted approximately one minute or less. I noticed how clear the atmosphere was and there was no visible cloud cover in the area of the light show. The large light and each of the three strings of smaller lights were on a more or less level, horizontal plane and were about 30 degrees above the horizon. The large light was approximately 30 degrees to the south of my direction of travel; I was traveling almost due east. The first string of smaller lights was approximately 15 degrees south of the easterly line of my travel; the second string of lights was closer to the large light and about 20 degrees south of my line of travel. The third and final string of lights was the farthest away from the large light and approximately 10 degrees south of my line of travel. The UFO providing this light show was certainly not concerned about whether or not it would be observed over this populated, rural area early in the evening on a perfectly clear night. Perhaps the UFO wished to be observed for some unknown reason. These lights definitely were not flares and could not be any type of aircraft known to the average person. ���Unidenified freaky lights��� Fill the Sky: February 8, 2009 Stephenville Empire-Tribune (eight witnesses identified; myself not included) www.empiretribune.com article by Whitney White-Ashley"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02132009-0013","Summary":"One large, bright light; three different series of about 7 smaller lights sequencing on and then all turning off simultaneoulsy; large light then faded away.","Date of the Event":"02/05/2009 07:25 UTC","City":"De Leon","Case Number":"15479","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.120254,+-98.533262(15479)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15479) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
