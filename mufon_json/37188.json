It was about 10:09pm, eastern time April 7th 2012. We turned the corner and I looked at the moon and saw five red-orange star like objects surrounding it. I pointed them out to my father, who saw them as well. I was confused as to what it could possibly be and i tried to keep my eyes fixed on them as my father continued to drive. Some 30 seconds later, I got out of the car and I could still see 3 of the stars left. They were no longer near the moon but they appeared to be unmoving. As I watched them, i realized they were fading away, each at a different rate. Even after the phenomenon was over, I was unsure as to what it was that I actually witnessed."],"Latitude":"36.856099","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"None","Region":"Virginia","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.856099,+-76.284683(37188)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37188) map </A>","Case Number":"37188","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/07/2012 11:33 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37188.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37188.html"],"City":"Norfolk","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"04/07/2012 10:10 UTC","Longitude":"-76.284683","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-04072012-0021","Summary":"Saw 5 red orange stars which slowly faded away at different times","Country":"United States"}
