I had left my house at 715am to go across the street to thebus stop,I was about to be on my way to school.i was standing near the bus stopwaiting for the bus.5 minutes after i arrived at the bus stop at about 720am,iheard what i thought was an airplane taking off from jfk intl i live nearjfk,but the sound only lasted 3 seconds,so i thought that was strange,but didntthink much about it,then about 4 seconds after i heard the sound stop,i say 4objects flying in the sky,they were a little of in the distance,not too far atall,they were closer to where i was than the airplanes are when they takeoff,and they were somewhat low to the ground. what made me notice the objectswas their shine,when the first appeared the sun was just glistening off ofthem,so they look like silver balloons,they were flying together pretty slow,andat the same exact speed,and thats what i thought they were at first,balloons.soi searched to see if i could see a balloon string that held them together soclose,but within 1 secong of that search,i already saw that there was no stringat all,my heart started to race a bit,all of this happened within 4 seconds ofthem appearing to my vision.then right after that 4 second time periodfinished,the crafts started to fly in a twisty, and varied orbit aroundeachother,they cut eachother off as they orbited,thats when my heart began toreally pump,they did all of this flying foward at their slow pace,on a steadyhorizontal path.they continued to orbit around eachother for about 4seconds,then they all flew into a formation, the formation was a slantedvertical formation,they were still flying foward slowly,1 under the other.theyflew like that for 2 seconds,then they went right back to the cut off,twistyorbit around eachother,and by that time they were closer than they were whenthey had appeared,but still flying away,and still flying along the samehorizontal path.this was when i could better see their backs,and i made out whati had thought to be lights earlier on,were lights,each of the 4 had 1 light ontheir backs that blinked to green,and red,and white,in a random order.they wereall exremely identical,they were very dark brown in color,but very shiny likeglass,their backs were flat,and very very chrome-"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"New York"}
