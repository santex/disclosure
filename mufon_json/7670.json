He is a total skeptic, and was shocked by this object. We were looking up for the meteor showers, and up above Orion was this very strange looking UFO. It changed from a circular shape to a triangular shape to even a square shape...I am an amateur astronomer, I have never seen this...I was frightened. It appeared to be very large, very massive, very high. It was black with lights outlining it, and it had a circular light outline in the middle of it. We watched it for quite awhile, it darted up and down but basically stayed in the same vicinity. When we first watched it, we thought it was a phenomena of the meteor shower, but it makes no sense...I really have never seen ANYTHING of this nature."],"Log Number":"CA-08142007-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
