This is my third sighting....I had arrived at work and used my swipe card to get into the building. But it would not work as the security system does not allow me entry till 5:00 AM. According to my watch it was about 4:59 AM. So to waste a bit of time I looked up at the stars. The sky was dark and clear and just a bit of light was showing on the eastern horizon. Suddenly I saw a star blink out in the south-east sky. Thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me I squinted in the direction of the blinked out star. Then I saw it, moving fast. It was a blimp shaped grey cloud moving from south-east to north-west, with the leading edges a bit lighter in colour. A sort of boomerang lighting effect. It crossed the sky in about 1 to 1.5 seconds and dissapeared in the dark. I was excited as it confirmed to me that the 2 sightings I had before were not figments of my imagination. My first reaction was to get into the building before the craft came back."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/20/2011 04:59 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-04202011-0005","Summary":"Wow!
