{"divs":["sighting detailsabout 9:19pm while driving to work i notice 4 or 5 bright yellow\\organge orbs in the sky. i pulled over to see if i could get a photo. but they flickered out before i could. i then perceded on my way spotting only a few of them closer to town. again flickering out quickly. only a mile or so to work i looked up again and notice this time about 5 star like light blinking really rapidly. they were not in a specific formation or as best i could tell. i was so amped up at the sighting that i tried to call my friend. though it took about 5 minutes to get through since it kept saying no network. which is strange since i always get a signal. finally, i got through to my friend and told her. though while telling her it hurt my head. then faded back to normal. later that night i went on break and had another strange sighting this time it was a blue orb that shot across the sky. it looked similar to a shooting star only it was huge. i only wish that the people i was on break seen it to. needless to say it was an eventfull night."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","City":"Dixon","Country":"United States","Summary":"Multiple UFO sightings on way to work.","Log Number":"US-09072011-0005","Latitude":"37.996756","Longitude":"-92.090678","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/07/2011 09:38 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval","Case Number":"31611","Region":"Missouri","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.996756,+-92.090678(31611)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31611) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/06/2011 09:19 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Dixon","There were no other sightings in Dixon on or around September 6th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31611.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
