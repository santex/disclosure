I notice a dark object in the sky approaching towards me at a low altitude. I see that is has no wings,no engine, I hear no sound. It looks a little like the front end of an F-117. It has some kind of flap on the rearend. I see the flap rise up and the aircraft does the same, going up above and out of sight. I look around but see nothing. I have never seen anything like this, and think that it is a ufo. It really moved like nothing I know of can. There were a few other cars on the road, but this happened in such a short amount of time that no one else may have seen it."],"Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.276453,+-97.738551(6281)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6281) map </A>","City":"Austin","Log Number":"US-01302007-0016","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"saw what I think was a ufo","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There was one other sighting in Austin on or around January 30th 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Triangle, Other","Date Submitted":"01/30/2007 10:33 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"6281","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6281.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6281.html"]}
