As we turned onto street i noticed up in the sky going east to west was a larger than starlike orangish red sphere traveling at a steady pace. I immediately said wow what is that to my friends. They didnt see it until we pulled into the driveway and i jumped out and pointed to it. By this time it was going right over us. They then spotted easily. As it flew over us and away it shrunk in size from being a larger than star object to being a star like object. It was cleary not a star or plane or anything like that. It made no sound. It just faded off behind the trees. We just stood there in awe. Note: This was not a fireworks."],"Log Number":"US-07052013-0003"}
