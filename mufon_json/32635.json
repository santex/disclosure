It was moving parallel to the milky way in a easterly direction. It travelled quickly but at a steady rate. We thought it was strange it was so bright and not blinking nor had a red light like all planes do. There was no sound emitted. We watched it for almost a minute before it dimmed then rapidly acended in an exponential curve outward as it completely disappeared into nothing, and we could no longer see it. We both just stood in amazement immediately confirming the details of the event to each other. We were excited that we had both witnessed together our second ufo event."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32635.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32635.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Region":"North Carolina","Log Number":"US-10162011-0024","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Lenoir","There were no other sightings in Lenoir on or around October 16th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"10/16/2011 08:53 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.932324,+-81.539872(32635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32635) map </A>","City":"Lenoir","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Brightest light in sky traveling straight path at steady rate.
