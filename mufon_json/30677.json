It was a clear night, the longest day of the year. I live in a cul-de-sac in a quiet subdivision in East Orlando, FL. I was walking my dog when I looked up and saw a large cylinder object come over a tall tree moving in a southeasterly direction. It didn't have wings or windows and was moving fairly slowly. It was a bright white silver color and the back end was red like when a cigarette is inhaled but there was no smoke trail and no sound. I watched it for about a minute before it disappeared over trees. I was trying to figure out what it could be and why it would be allowed so close to trees and houses with that large heat thing in the back. I couldn't make sense of it so I started looking on line which led me to UFO websites. I was skeptical at first but then excited that other people have witnessed the same type object. I had never heard of a cylinder type UFO. Anyway, I'm glad to have seen it and hope to see it again."],"Case Number":"30677","City":"Orlando","Date of the Event":"06/21/2011 10:30 UTC","Summary":"June 21, 2011, about 10:30 pm saw cylinder shaped UFO moving slowly across the sky","Longitude":"-81.213146","Object Features":"None, Other","trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around June 21st 2011"]}
