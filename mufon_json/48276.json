A solid white light was above the house when I looked up. It was traveling west to east. The light was not the headlight or landing light of a plane. It was the same brightness and intensity above me as it was when it was flying away from me. There were other commercial jets in the area with the normal landing lights and blinking collision lights and there was one helicopter in the distance. I could hear the commercial jets and the helicopter; but there was no notice from this steady light traveling west to east. After about 20 seconds, the light completely faded to nothing. It was still close enough to me, I mean, it didn't fade away because of distance. It just turned off. No sound."],"Date of the Event":"06/19/2013 09:22 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Straight path white light west to east which disappeared before out of range","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
