We saw a bright object that looked like a white light moving from north to south directly over head. Pretty sure it wasnt an aircraft because it was a consistant glowing bright white light no blinking or flashing. Moving too slow to be a meteor. It was moving in a straight line but appeared to slow down and speed up at times. We see alot of satellites and planes and this didnt look like anything we have seen before."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"41.503995","Date of the Event":"07/10/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.503995,+-81.686479(24431)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24431) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/11/2010 11:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-07112010-0010","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Cleveland","There were no other sightings in Cleveland on or around July 10th 2010"],"Summary":"Bright white light slowed down then sped up.","Tags":"City","Case Number":"24431","Longitude":"-81.686479","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Cleveland","Country":"United States"}
