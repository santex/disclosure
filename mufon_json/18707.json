I reached for my cell phone and took one photo. it was white bright in color with a stream of light coming from the bottom to the ground. then after about twenty minutes it sped away. I thought it was a large commercial plane at first that had it's front landing light on. Once it was closer and hovering moving left to right that is when it became surreal, seemed as if it wasn't really there."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Canyon","There were no other sightings in Canyon on or around August 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
