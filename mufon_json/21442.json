I was scanning around when i looked towards the north near a strip of cloud. Just above the cloud line i noticed a similar object from this past Saturday. It was that same yellowish white coloration as before and almost blended into the clouds. I watched it travel eastward above the clouds when i pointed it to my dad and he watched it move too. My sister joined us and we all watched as it moved at a pretty quick speed. As the object went behind a light post in front of our neighbors house we watched to spot it as it passed. But to all of our amazement it never came out from behind it as it disappeared from a relatively clear sky."],"Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21442.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21442.html"]}
