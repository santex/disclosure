As I walked out the door I saw this bright orange flame-like thing in the sky. My neighbors several houses down were having a picnic and I thought maybe they were shooting off fireworks so I watched this thing in the sky waiting for it to explode because at first I thought it was a firework. After several seconds I realized it wasn't a fire work because it was moving very slowly, never exploded, there was no noise and it hovered and changed direction. I called my girlfriend out of the house and she saw it too. We watched as it slowly ascended in altitude and moved off in the distance. It remained bright orange and eventually disappeared. This was not a plane and unlike anything I have ever seen before. The weather was very clear and calm. There was no cloud cover."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/04/2013 09:10 UTC","Region":"Connecticut","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.480086,+-73.005915(47167)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47167) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47167.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47167.html"],"Latitude":"41.480086","Object Shape":"Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON"}
