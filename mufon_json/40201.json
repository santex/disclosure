While we were watching the fireworks I looked up in the sky and noticed a slow moving object floating above the treetops. It was an orange amber color, that was giving off a luminous glow. My friend's father told us it was an airplane and that we shouldn't pay any mind to it. We noticed there were no flashing lights and watched it float across the sky. It went over the tree tops from north to south, it was floating very slowly. We turned around for a second to look at a firework that had gone off, we turned around and the orange object was gone. Nowhere to be found."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"San Leandro","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 06:02 UTC","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in San Leandro","There were no other sightings in San Leandro on or around July 4th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40201.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Orange round orb floating slowly in sky","Case Number":"40201","Latitude":"37.722749","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-122.132821","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-07052012-0039","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval"}
