{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting Details Time about 6: or 6:15pm. I was flying my rc airplane in the old Collin County park. I saw black object traveling just below the high clouds. The front was just about to get here and their were high white broken clouds standing almost still with lower dark broken clouds traveling north. It looked almost like a black balloon that was rotating in a horizontal motion. About one turn per two seconds. It was coming from the south almost over head. When it got to the north of me it turned back to the west in a broad turn. I brought my plane down right away and yelled for my wife to look and she got a brief look at it."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"10/23/2011 06:00 UTC","Summary":"Odd shaped black object rotating as it crossed the sky","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.261072","Case Number":"32841","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-96.65257","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in McKinney","There were no other sightings in McKinney on or around October 23rd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.261072,+-96.65257(32841)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32841) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"McKinney","Date Submitted":"10/24/2011 09:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Egg","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32841.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32841_submitter_file1__UFOminerotating.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32841.html"],"Log Number":"US-10242011-0025","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00"}
