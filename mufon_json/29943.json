It started as one red light and it began to multiply. At one point there were 10 lights visible. At first I thought it could be a plane. It was not! The object or objects made no sound. One red light followed by another then a third one flickered on behind them and so on. As they passed over my head I got in the car to drive down to a golf course for a better view. I felt very scared and excited at the same time. I lost sight of them as they flickered out over the horizon. This is the third time I saw these red lights in the sky. The first time was July 3rd 2010 and july 4th 2010. I am an amateur astronomer and I have also been in the aerospace and defense industry for over 15 years. What I saw was not jet planes and it was not a planet or stars. These looked like the same lights that were filmed over Arizona a few years back."],"City":"Medford","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"New York","Summary":"Multiple Red non blinking lights","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.820318,+-72.991777(29943)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29943) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.820318","Case Number":"29943","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None"}
