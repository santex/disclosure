I immediately seen a large almost round object overhead moving through the sky. It almost seemed to be glowing like when something enters the atmosphere. It also seemed to have very short almost firey looking tail. It reminded me of what something would look like burning up coming into the atmosphere. I watched it for about 20 seconds. When it started to go over the tree line in the distance it was getting smaller and then turned a silver color and was gone. It made no noise and was going about the same speed as a jet would. This happened at 8:45 and it was dark. I have seen many things but nothing like this. About a minute later a jet came from the direction that I last saw it."],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 08:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:21","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"42202","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
