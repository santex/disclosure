I bought my new camera with super night shot plus. I had the camera on standby and when it the camera got to about 60 minutes or so on the battery I said to myself (after waiting for about 30 min.) there's no point in keeping it on until its time. It couldn't have been more than 30 seconds later and south of my position crossing from west to east one showed up... I said outloud \"bingo\" and looked down to get the camera up and running, by the time I got it set and looked back up to get its position. It cloaked. About 15 minutes passed by and I was lying down on the roof because after a while my neck hurts from looking up. So after getting comfortable I was looking straight up and one passed over again. The clouds covered it up before I could do anything. So another frustrating night for me. It seems that they are very aware of my thoughts but it seems they want me to see them, and obviously learn something. I do feel that they are being discreet for a reason. I can only hope that in time the truth will be known."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.462133,+-91.13096(8060)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8060) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Baton Rouge","Case Number":"8060","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Baton Rouge","There were no other sightings in Baton Rouge on or around October 4th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Louisiana"}
