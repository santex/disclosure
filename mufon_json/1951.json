He was on hisway to his friends house. It was dark at about 626-628 pm. We were travellingdown a limestone road, and we were the only vehicle around. It was partlycloudy, no wind, clear--no rain. We noticed the lights of the object first. Itseemed as though it was just sitting in the sky, hovering, I suppose. Thelights looked square, yet appeared to be in a strip. The lights seemed to beshaped in a half moon shape. My son kept saying, What is that and he stoppedthe van. He was so excited and we both could not figure out what it was. Itwas hovering as we stopped then just went straight up, very fast. It travelledas high as a big commercial airliner would be in the time it would take you tosay one. As it went up the lights went off for a minute, then came back on andthen it was just gone. Once it seemed to disappear, we left and travelled on toour destination."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1951.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/27/2002 06:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"","Longitude":"-82.572877","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
