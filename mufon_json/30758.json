The object came to a stop abruptly and sat hovering at what i could easily tell was an extremely high altitude, also knowing this and how far it probably was easily assuming it was quite large in size. It sat still for about 30sec to a min when it suddenly ejected something in an eruption and stream of light that looked like a black mass or possibly a silhouette of an object moving away from the object. within 3 or 4 minutes helicopter and black helicopter and jet activity spiked heavily for about 15 minutes. also during this time i would like to note there were 4 shooting stars that streaked the sky during the time i watched this hovering star like object.(likely by chance, but possibly having something to do with event??)"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 07:19 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
