I jumped up and moved to the window to watch what it was doing. There were no flashing lights as you would expect from a jet liner and it was moving at a constant speed away from my house. I kept watching it as it moved away and it got dimmer and dimmer before I lost I behind the trees in the distance. It wasn't a Chinese lantern either because the light given off was a brilliant white, not a flickering yellow. It wasn't flickering at all and the glare was consistent . I'd say it was between 150 to 200 ft in the air and around the same distance from my house."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
