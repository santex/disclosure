{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the morning of August 6 I awoke early to choke my chicken. (I am a chicken rancher and part time head of the [Profanity Deleted] moppers Union Local 384.) I heard a low thundering pulse and looked into the sky and saw a UFO with the words Suzy Licktenshtein on the side glowing in red. I grew woozy and then it seemed as though all time stopped. I woke up about 2 hours ago and one of my orifices is swollen - I won't tell you which one. I suspect that I was prodded by this Alien Sex Monster and I think I have been impregnated. Please pray that this is not so."],"Latitude":"34.174511","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Thousand Oaks","There were no other sightings in Thousand Oaks on or around August 6th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Thousand Oaks","Longitude":"-118.833394","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08062008-0009","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"11953","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Summary":"I saw a strange object in the sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11953.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11953.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/06/2008 05:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Date Submitted":"08/06/2008 05:30 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.174511,+-118.833394(11953)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11953) map </A>"}
