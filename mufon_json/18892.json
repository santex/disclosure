{"Longitude":"23.147941","divs":["Sighting DetailsAugust 23,at about 11:30 in the evening I was sitting outside and watching stars. I was looking to the North star,and suddenly,about South West from that star,something flashed REALLY HARD and it flashed my eyes. First,I thought its just a something flashing in my eyes,but then I looked to that star,and it flashed again like a camera flash. Any idea on you think it is? Maybe there was 2 meteors crashing to each other? And then,I looked above me,to the Milky Way core,and I saw something like a bullet or so."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"It happened really fast","Date of the Event":"08/23/2009 11:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18892.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18892.html"],"Country":"Lithuania","Log Number":"LT-08262009-0011","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"55.793327","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Flash","Case Number":"18892","City":"ÃÂ iauliÃÂ³ rajonas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/23/2009 11:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Šiaulių rajonas","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"11:30:28","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=55.793327,+23.147941(18892)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18892) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
