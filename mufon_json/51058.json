{"City":"Colorado Springs","Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving on cimmaron and highway 24 toward woodland park direction and was stop at a red light at the intersection of 24 and 21 street getting ready too turn left on 21 street. I seen this black ball that was moving at a steady speed but fast over the waldo burn scar area in Colorado springs, Colorado. It wasn't a balloon because it was moving straight then made a turn in a head wind coming over the mountains. We had wind gust up to 50 plus mph that day. I first notice this object because it was in my main line of sight. The first thing that came to my mind about this object was it was different than anything I seen before. This object was black and it was still day light outside. It seem to be under control and made a turning move over the mountains. I kept telling my daughter do you see that black ball moving in the sky. She said she seen it also. The object just vanish in the area."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-09252013-0003","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There was one other sighting in Colorado Springs on or around September 23rd 2013"],"Latitude":"38.868821","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-104.880489","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/23/2013 07:45 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Black ball moving fast over the mountains toward waldo canyon.","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"51058","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51058.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51058.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2013 12:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.868821,+-104.880489(51058)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51058) map </A>"}
