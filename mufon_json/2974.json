The dog starting acting like it was scared. It kept looking at the field to the south and trying to pull me north. I thought that it was the power lines in front of the house because they were clicking which I thought was odd because they normaly just buzz a bit. Looking up at the power line I seen a bright spot that I thought was Mars until it went out. Then I noticed what apeared to be a red globe just appear about a mile south in the sky for about 30 sec. Then it went out. Then another to the left just apeared for 30 sec. Then another to the left of that for about 30 sec. Then 5 min later several jets were flying around. The jets were flying in circle about 10 to 20 miles. 5 min later the lights in the sky did the same thing. Then the jets would come back. Then the lights came back on. Then jets came back and stayed around for while and I didnt see the light anymore. Today on the radio they anounced the FBI and Air Force are investigating strange lights in the sky."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unknown"}
