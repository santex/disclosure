{"divs":["Sighting Detailsmy co-worker and i were seated at the desks that faced the huge glass windows. we were very busy. suddenly, a huge airship that was about 100 yards wide, rose from the thick trees about 60 yds in front of us.it was circular with pulsing,blue lights. it hovered above the trees. we both jumped up and screamed. as if it heard us, it made a complete rotation and zipped into the ground. when the other workers turned around to see what frightened us, it was gone. how could something of that size slam into the ground without a sound or a tremor? i don't know what it was, but i know what it wasn't.it was not of this world's technology."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8905.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/31/1974 03:30 UTC","City":"San Antonio","Country":"United States","Summary":"co-worker and i saw large, rotating air ship with blue pulsing lights hovering above trees","Tags":"City","Case Number":"8905","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"08/31/1974 03:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01152008-0048","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"29.425392","Longitude":"-98.485668","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.425392,+-98.485668(8905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8905) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around August 31st 1974"]}
