We lived on a farm between Pickerington and Baltimore near the community of Harley on Hwy 256. At approximately 8:00pm sometime during the summer months I and my father were standing on the front porch. At a distance of what I would guess was 5 to 7 miles south of us we saw a very large Blimp like object. The object was at least 6 times the size of a regular blimp. I estimate the altitude to be 1000 to 1500 feet. The blimp like object was covered with hundreds of lights, white, red, green, blue and orange. The object was traveling east to west on a line that would take the object just south of Columbus Ohio. I asked my father what is it and he replied son it���s not a blimp, at that moment one of the lights on the bottom of the object grew brighter in color and then dropped strait down falling at a high rate of speed. It fell to approximately 200 feet then came strait toward our house at a high rate of speed steadily dropping in altitude until it was just above the corn field across the street then right before impacting our house it made a sharp left hand turn to the west. As it turned I felt the heat and saw the flame on the rear of the object. It looked as if it was a small disc or flat missile shape 10 feet long and 5 to 6 feet wide and about 3 to 4 feet thick. As it turned to the west it accelerated at an extremely fast rate and climbed out of site within seconds. As we turned back to the larger blimp like object it was now moving west and out of our sight. The sighting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. The next morning we went to the corn field just next to the house where the small object had turned just before impacting our house. We observed that the corn was burned on the top of the plants in a strait path heading off to the west for 100 to 200 feet. The burn pattern was about 4 feet wide. My father called someone ���I don���t know who��� to report the incident. That afternoon 2 men dressed in suits and identified themselves as federal agents came to our house and talked to me and my father about what we had observed. After taking our statements they told us what we saw was a weather balloon, because the weather service had launched them from the airport in Columbus that afternoon. Funny thing is my father worked at the Columbus airport and he did not believe the agents and stated so after they had left. He told me son what we saw was no weather balloon or blimp."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12343.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12343.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","City":"Pickerington"}
