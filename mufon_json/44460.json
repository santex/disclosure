My wife caming running into the house from upstairs and said \"you have to see this\", I ran upstairs and as I went out on our deck looking north toward the White Tank Mountains I saw a pearl like staggered trail of 20+ bright yellow orange orbs. They where ascending from what I guess a landing spot by the mountains or on the golf course, but coming into view from what I suspect was an area of no houses. As they climbed they increased speed turned north and sped off disappearing. I ran inside to get my camera after standing stunned, but as I got back on the deck the last of them was coiming above the houses and then heading off. I got off a couple of shots, but they were dark and blurry. I often see lights that look the same to the southwest, but they stay stationary for 15 to 20 minutes only sometimes moving. Mufon has been to my area before and talked to me, but this was an experience that I will never forget. I waited to tell the story because without pictures it's just my word. Let me tell you that if I had these pictures or VIDEO(especially what my wife saw before she got me)It would be epic! It was incredible!!! I will include a picture from other sightings so you can see the color, but this was more like a staggered string of orange pearls."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.478953,+-112.505434(44460)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44460) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/11/2012 08:22 UTC"}
