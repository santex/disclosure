I do not remember the exact date. The sighting occurred after 14 hours. In the city of Aruj��� in the state of Sao Paulo, near the International Airport of Guarulhos. At this time I was at work in the administrative building of the factory. I watched through the window what looked like a balloon, but not surprised. What I looked was the fact that approximately 15 minutes after the object was in the same place. A balloon would not stay in place after this time. I grabbed my camera and took three consecutive shots of the object that was above the trees. Visually appeared metallic. remained static height, but seemed to spin a shaft. After taking the pictures was to show some friends from work just after the object disappeared. This was the second viewing of a total of 5, but only one that got visual proof. Frankly I think this is a weather balloon, even being close (approximately 10 km) from the airport station. But the fact remains reasonable time stopped in the air intrigued me. Normally a balloon moves because of the wind. In the picture the object is located just above the green concrete structure (the factory cafeteria.)"],"Longitude":"-46.321444","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.396452,+-46.321444(27411)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27411) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"-23.396452","Region":"SÃÂ£o Paulo","Date of the Event":"12/04/2005 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/16/2011 12:26 UTC","Summary":"(sg) Small, metallic, spherical and apparently static.","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"27411","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Arujá","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
