I can't believe whatever the hell that was but I'm telling you it was real! A black traingle came from the se moving slowly. Went outside because dog was crying, wimpering. All of a sudden things got really quiet, all nocturnal sounds quit, crickets frogs you name it they all stopped! When I looked up I noticed stars disapeared but was because the black shaped triangle shaped thing blocked out stars I went inside to get camera. My lights went out I had to use a cig lighter to find camera I got 1 pic but not to good because it was dark. How freakin strange. I went back outside just a few mins ago because I heard loud noise & 2 helicopters just flew by heading same direction."],"Weather Factors":"Windy","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28735.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28735.html"],"Longitude":"-87.214165","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"04/20/2011 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.428359,+-87.214165(28735)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28735) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/20/2011 11:41 UTC","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Pensacola","There were no other sightings in Pensacola on or around April 20th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Triangle"}
