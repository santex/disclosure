I pulled out binocs and watched this, what I thought was a plane heading east over the lake. It never moved it just flashed red, blue, white lights. So I pulled out my video camera to video tape which I did. I even have a plane come into view twice but it never moved it just hover. I didn't know who to call or question what we were seeing.
