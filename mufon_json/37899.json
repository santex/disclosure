(i'm a weather enthusiast--i love storms) i decided to shoot some pics with an olympus c-60 (just a pointnshoot, nothing fancy) we didn't see or hear anything strange until i uploaded the photos to my pc. neither my husband nor i saw or heard anything unusual at the time of the photo. one image had the above capture. i inverted the photos in photoshop cs5 and enlarged the area in question. i have probably taken 5-10,000 photos with this camera and have never seen anything like this. i can identify camera malfunctions\\glitches that would cause anomalies. the trail behind the object would indicate that there was motion and i believe the object may have been flying too fast to see with the naked eye. this was captured in cambridge, on canada, may 3, 2012 at approximately 8pm thanks,"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
