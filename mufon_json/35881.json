{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw three orange-red glowing orbs, about a half mile off on the Eastern horizon.. maybe 500 feet up. They were moving in patterns around eachother sort of like when you are mixing cups around on the table with a ball onder one of them.. Kind of a figure eight pattern with three orbs. They would also move and then stop and hover for a while in other patterns. This lasted for only a few minutes and then they faded away. They did not fly off... they just dimmed out and were gone. I had a couple people with me when I saw this, but at this time none of us had a camera."],"Case Number":"35881","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/17/2012 02:18 UTC","City":"Modesto","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Modesto","There was one other sighting in Modesto on or around September 1st 2008"],"Log Number":"US-02172012-0019","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 orange-red orbs","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-121.004238","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35881.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"37.651191","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.651191,+-121.004238(35881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35881) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
