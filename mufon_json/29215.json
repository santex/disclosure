His house is essentially in the middle of nowhere and is surrounded by corn fields. On a clear night, you can see every star in the pitch black sky, as it is void of air pollution and smog. Tonight, however, we are expecting serious storm systems so the sky was extremely cloudy and overcast. Dark grey clouds blocked any stars or airplanes in the sky. However, looking to the eastern part of the sky, I noticed a vibrantly glowing orange light hovering in the air. Having avid interest in UFOs, I pointed it out to my fiance, asking him if there was a streetlight or radio tower in that area. He quickly brushed off these possibilities, as his house is surrounded by farmland as I mentioned. We stood staring at the UFO. It hung stationary in the sky, glowing a bright orange. It didn���t waver like an airplane- in fact, it didn���t move whatsoever. The object was VERY still. It seemed to flash a little bit of red in the lower right corner. For the most part, it was entirely orange- a very vibrant orange. The UFO captivated us since it stood out so sharply against the cloud-covered sky. I cannot emphasize this enough. [I took careful note on my drive home- I couldn���t even see any airplanes against the heavy cloud coverage.] After about 2 minutes of observation, the orange object began to get smaller and smaller before it disappeared. Needless to say, I was very anxious on my drive home (and still am)."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Case Number":"29215","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05232011-0003","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"41.428464","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Vibrant, stationary orange object hovering in sky","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Lightning, Fog, Light","City":"Monee","Region":"Illinois","Date Submitted":"05/23/2011 01:18 UTC"}
