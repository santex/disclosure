I saw 3 starlike bright lights. At first I thought they were just bright stats. But I found em unusual because they were unrecognizable stars. So...After watching for about 2 min. The three starlights converged into a tight triangle. They sat still in that formation for another minute or 2. Then the light seemed to asend very fast, straight up into space. The lights just twinkled out of site. Very unusual no sound and moved way to fast to have been a helicopter. I'm sure it was not from this world.
