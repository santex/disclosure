It was fascinating and may not be UFO related but wanted to report it just in case. We have not stopped talking about it, I even called my dad to tell him. I look forward to seeing if anyone else brings it up."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09052009-0017","Latitude":"40.419287","Region":"Ohio","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/05/2009 11:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Oval, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"19092","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19092.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Saw what looked like a meteor falling and then saw the lights.","Longitude":"-82.899113","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/05/2009 09:20 UTC"}
