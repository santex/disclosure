Find someone who had recorded this game. Just prior to kickoff there is a shot of the sky over the endzone. You will see a dark object which appears to be slowly moving away from the camera as it turns left and right very slowly. Then very suddenly the object will shoot in the other direction and out of the field of view. Viewed in slow motion you can see that the object is acually moving and does not just disappear from the screen... it accelerates at tremendous speed. I belive my copy of this will be lost because I was not recording it. I am able to rewind my digital broadcast, but I am afraid I will lose it. I will however, try to save it by hitting the record button and hope that it will capture what was there from the beginning. If you can find someone who has recorded the game from just before the kickoff you will see it for sure. Feel free to contact me to see if I was able to capture this with my DVR."],"trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Gainesville","There were no other sightings in Gainesville on or around September 19th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19397.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19397.html"],"Case Number":"19397"}
