(these light may have appeared more dominant because there were facing us more directly than the other two had). my sister described the top of this object as having a spherical structure to it. we proceeded up the hill which lead to deep run road. we made a right and proceeded to try and follow the object, ended up being more round about of a road and by the time we came closer back to our original location, the object was gone. i could not find it in the night sky. the only object i could see in the sky were normal, blinking, red tinted planes. planes i could identify normally. this obscure object vanished. i have no idea what happened to it, but myself and the three other people with me saw something we had never seen in our entire lives. this object furthermore had no engine sound. annie described it as a buzzing, humming sound. after the incident i told many people and was informed of other sitings in the bucks county area. please write back any inquiry or information you may have for us, or if others reported siting the same distinct object in the sky. this testimony is 100% truthful, i want to know if others saw it, if this object was on a radar, whatever you guys do to figure this stuff out, please let me know the details of your finding. you may contact me, ask me questions, etc. i will fully cooperate and i am intent on learning of what this was. {pid} {cms\\jat\\pid} text moved to narrative"]}
