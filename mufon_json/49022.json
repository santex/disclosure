I had a feeling right away I was in contact with a ET. It dematerilazided when i finished my smoke and put it in a ash tray, disapointed i turned arround to leave, but turned arround for one last glance and saw it was back, so i kept watching, it moved in a zig zag pattern up and then disapeared into thin air again and re apreared not far from where it had just been. My feeling was almost ectasy like, i was happy, excited and not a worry in the world, i noticed it became more and more distant as i heard other people walking down my street, thats when i stoped looking to glance off of my deck to see the people walking down the road, when i looked back up, it was gone"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Region":"Saskatchewan","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Warman","Log Number":"CA-07182013-0008","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
