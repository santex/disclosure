The bright object was moving slowly toward the southwest. My observation was from the front picture window of my house up on a hill. The object was under a solid cloud cover. At first I thought the object was airplane landing lights, but out of the usual flight path. As it got closer and larger I turned around to a nearby table to get some small binoculars out of the drawer, but when I turned back around the object had disappeared. The object was visible and caught my eye when I first came into the room. I observed it for a couple of minutes before reaching for the binoculars. After the object disapeared, I observed the sky for another few minutes to make sure it was not an aircraft. During my observation, there were no other aircraft in my field of vision, which from northern Tennessee to southern Kentucky is unlimited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Observed large bright object under cloud cover","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32923.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32923.html"],"Latitude":"36.292856","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-86.702806","Log Number":"US-10282011-0007","Date Submitted":"10/28/2011 01:15 UTC"}
