At first I thought it was a plane at first but then I noticed that it was round shaped. I looked at it for about 30 seconds and turned back around so I could point out the object. When I looked back up, it was completely gone. There was no way an aircraft could travel that fast because I had a very wide range of view and was only turned away for a few seconds."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-90.516667","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in St Charles","There were no other sightings in St Charles on or around August 16th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"12122","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"St Charles","Disposition":"IFO"}
