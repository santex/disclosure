Looked in the general direction of the Ocean. Thought what I was seeing was Mars because of the color then realized it was much too red. It moved laterally. Then the light went off. The light reappeared for a few seconds and then disappeared completely. All of this happened in less than five minutes. There was no noise. There are no airports here except a landing strip which is rarely used at night. The night was clear and cloudless. My first thoughts were that it was a UFO. The island where I live is surrounded by water, which may or may not be related, but there have been numerous sightings. I have seen one very close up and have had a few other sightings in the distance. Is it possible to find out if anyone else also saw unusual lights in the sky last night? Thanks, Beverly"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Nags Head","There were no other sightings in Nags Head on or around December 17th 2007"],"Log Number":"US-12182007-0001"}
