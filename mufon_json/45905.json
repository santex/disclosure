{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhen I was 15 I was visiting cousins in Ashtabula, Ohio in the summer of 1967. On my first night there, I was sleeping alone in a separate room on the second floor. I had gone to sleep about 10pm. In the dead of night, appx 2am I was awoken by a bright light shining on me from the sky through the window. I found that I couldn't move. I was confused, but did not feel threatened. I didn't react at all, but went straight back to sleep.It felt as if I was being observed or examined, but also being communicated with. I remembered the event the next morning but for some reason did not say anything to anybody, until right now."],"Date Submitted":"02/25/2013 11:29 UTC","Region":"Ohio","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Cleveland","There were no other sightings in Cleveland on or around July 18th 1967"],"Log Number":"US-02252013-0017","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.507155","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"While I was sleeping a bright light shone through the window and paralyzed me","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.691999","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45905.html"],"Object Flight Path":"N/A","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.507155,+-81.691999(45905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45905) map </A>","City":"Cleveland","Date of the Event":"07/18/1967 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"45905"}
