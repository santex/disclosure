Not really familiar with the area but the first night we drove in to Austin we spotted (during the day, maybe 4 or 5pm) two bright lights adjacent to each other, not moving at all. One of them suddenly either disappeared or seemed to move away, as we watched from the car the second light did the same. Last night we were driving again and my boyfriend pointed out three bright stationary lights in the sky. I looked and it definitely seemed like some sort of aircraft, but we were driving away from it. Freaked me out, could barely sleep."],"Date Submitted":"01/09/2013 02:11 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"ufo in austin","Date of the Event":"01/09/2013 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01092013-0006","Case Number":"45111","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
