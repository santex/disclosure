{"divs":["sighting detailsi was at a gas station parking lot, i raised my eyes into the sky, and i saw 4 lights moving slow at equal distances from each other and it looked like a big, black triangle. it was so close that i thought i could fit the entire gas station\\building\\parking lot\\pumps all into the size of this object. the lighting was on each tip of the triangle and in the middle, and it looked like halos, radiating white light. the distinctive shape of dark black as something triangular and black, moving slowly through the sky at estimated 20 miles per hour, along interstate 55 heading south from turrell, arkansas towards memphis, tennesse at citgo\\flash station. i watched it a good 30 seconds, following it with my eyes, even turning around the corner of the gas station building to try to see more. i kept seeing it a few seconds longer before it disappeared. whole thing lasted about 45 seconds. only other people around were strangers and pre-occupied with pumping gas or passengers in cars, going in\\out of gas station. my traveling group was inside, so no legit witnesses to view with me. this is my first time to have witnessed something like this. it was very obvious to me and in my mind that it was an unidentified flying object of some sort, and that there is something out there that we do not know, and it's roaming the earth. searching online, i found the term black triangle and was glad to see other prior sightings as to what i had. when i saw the image online (\"triangle belguim picture\"), it matched what i saw. we're not alone.."],"Date of the Event":"11/18/2012 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.382805,+-90.267145(44081)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44081) map </A>","City":"Turrell","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44081.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44081.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Region":"Arkansas","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.382805","Log Number":"US-11222012-0006","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Turrell","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/22/2012 03:49 UTC","Longitude":"-90.267145","Summary":"giant black triangle with lights","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"44081","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
