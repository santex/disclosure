I at first noticed 3 flashing aircrafts in the sky. My friend whom is in the air force, kept watching and exclaimed to me, \"Ralph, those aren't planes!\". By that time, we were pulling into my apartment complex. I parked and watched closer. More and more flashing objects kept appearing in the sky. I spotted one closer to me and noticed it was shaped like a triangle. It moved at a very rapid pace north. I lost sight of all of them when i went into my apartment to go and get my digital camera. I was never a believer of UFOs or anything like that until tonight. I was actually excited to be proved wrong. I am now a believer and will look out for more sightings."],"Date Submitted":"01/13/2010 11:57 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
