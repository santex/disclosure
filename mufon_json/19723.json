(also where the on-ramp merge to the john f. kennedy expressway.) looking up out the window i saw the unusual object in the sky. the sun had set, but the sky was clear and not totally dark. it was a non-specific mass of red\\orange, appearing stationary. i looked around and saw an older, man peering up into the sky, from the passenger window of a car to my left. i shouted over to him, \"what -is that-?\" without looking at me, his eyes fixed into the sky, he replied, \"a ufo.\" from the intersection of harlem (il43) and bryn mawr ave. the object was directly over the john f. kennedy expressway, and less than a mile west from that intersection. air traffic over the kennedy in the usual landing pattern from lake michigan was visible. the traffic light turned green, so i proceeded to pull directly over to the right on the bridge over the kennedy expressway by the entryway to the cta blue line el station. there were two men standing there. i exited my car and asked them to look up and help describe what we saw.i suggested a hot air balloon, as this is my only preconception of such fire-like appearance. but the object was close enough to see there was no fire. hot air-balloons do not produce that much fire. the one man suggested the object was about 1000 feet above the airplanes. he also said that a hot-air balloon would not be around that long with so much flame. there was debate about there 'being hot air balloons around sometimes,' as one of the men believed it could be a balloon. i dispelled as ludicrous, it was nor spherical. also, because the two men also agreed that the object .was about 1000 feet above the airplanes that were coming over the kennedy expressway this is most definitely not a faa route for evening balloon rides. it is difficult to describe the coloring and shape of what i observed. it was at first red and orange. it was not patternable, even as a campfire's huge flame. it was more contained than that huge a fire would be. it was the glow of burning fire colors and yet there was a subdued brightness i can only describe as super hot molten bright gold."],"Log Number":"US-09292009-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/29/2009 05:12 UTC"}
