Shortly after one friend spotted the first craft and said \"is that a satellite?\" The craft then proceeded to descend from space to around 30-50 feet above us, flashed a huge white light on us and then flew off into space again. Another 5 crafts could be seen in space with the original craft appearing in random locations then following each other on the same flight course. A large Orange orb appeared on the horizon about the same size as a full moon and hung there for about 15 min. Another star on the horizon started to pulsate growing in size as large as a full moon and contracting into near invisibility. The crafts were all headed on a tangent towards the pulsating craft on the horizon and as we were watching that the other orange orb had vanished."],"Summary":"Small Fleet + 2 Large Crafts.","Case Number":"35515"}
