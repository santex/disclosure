I will gather more information from her about this sighting and will provide her contact info if you contact me back. Here is her last message to me.... \"It was this morning when the storm rolled in...about 9 or 930. I took a bunch of pics and I never noticed it. I posted it on Weatherboy cuz they said post pics of the storm near you. Then I went back to look at the pic and Danielle said what's up with the ufo. Then I saw there was a bunch of people that shared it on ufo sites. So I looked closes. The instagram version I posted makes it much clearer but I posted this one to prove it wasn't the filter.\""],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"New Castle","Region":"Delaware","Summary":"My best friend and coworker sent me this picture taken outside of my work.","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in New Castle","There were no other sightings in New Castle on or around June 13th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06132013-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48113.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/48113_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48113.html"],"Object Flight Path":"N/A","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"48113","Date Submitted":"06/13/2013 09:22 UTC","Latitude":"39.668777","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.668777,+-75.564513(48113)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48113) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/13/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere"}
