I work at a beach hotel. I ran up to the top of the garage, three stories high, and watched it continue moving out over the water until it disappeared. Then as turned to go into work, facing south east, I noticed another orange light moving the same way but it seemed to be coming from a different trajectory, but heading in the same direction as the other one until it too disappeared over the Gulf of Mexico."],"trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Sarasota","There were no other sightings in Sarasota on or around November 9th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.522883","Latitude":"27.338535","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"52167","Source":"MUFON","City":"Sarasota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52167.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52167.html"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/09/2013 10:45 UTC","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Two orange orbs","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.338535,+-82.522883(52167)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52167) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11112013-0001"}
