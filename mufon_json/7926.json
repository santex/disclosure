The observation occurred around 4 P.M. on February 23, 1984 over Hamilton Hall on the Ohio State University campus in Columbus, Ohio. When the first witness, W1, sighted the object, from a stairwell under an east-facing window, it looked, in general, like a flying, rotating rectangle. Part of the time it had a bright light under it. It moved slowly, was on the flight path of Port Columbus Airport, and a low jet appeared to pass under it as W1 watched. W1 went to the department office and collected 4 other witnesses. In general, it looked like a rectangle, which would disappear and then come back into view. During part of the observation, a much smaller, but very bright white light was under the rectangle. The object rotated at precise regular intervals of about once a minute. It didn���t just twist randomly in the wind. The witnesses watched it for approximately 20-25 minutes as, it slowly drifted toward Port Columbus airport. The witnesses asked if there were a telescope or camera in the building, but were unable to find one. By around 4:20, a witness called Warren Nicholson, who worked at the nearby Battelle Memorial Institute and who investigates UFO sightings. By this time, the object was nearly out of sight. Mr. Nicholson called back to say that he had looked for it from the roof of the main Battelle building, but had been unable to see it. He later said that he had checked with Port Columbus immediately and they told him the wind velocity was 0. They couldn���t see it on radar. Mr. Nicholson later said that that evening a family had also made a UFO report describing it as four lines in the sky. The father had taken pictures through a 1200 power telephoto lens with ASA 400 color film. The wife described the lines as tear drop shaped and the husband described each as shaped like an airplane���s wing section. They were visible in the west and were dark. They then flew away in four different directions. Mr. Nicholson said the witnesses were very credible. He thought that many sightings in one day were a ���flurry��� of activity. So far, the object has never been identified. One characteristic noted by all witnesses was its regular rotation and rectangular appearance. No balloon shape was seen. It would be quite difficult for a balloon to continually rotate regularly, because wind currents would prevent this. The rotation was very regular, not a twisting in the wind (and there was no wind). In addition, there would need to be some sort of power plant and a method of propulsion to allow it to maintain its rotation. This sighting was in some ways similar to the November 2006 sighting over O���Hare in that it was near an airport, where an airplane could have struck the object. As in the O���Hare observation, all witness was credible. All now have Ph.D.s and have been or are university professors. The reports were collected from each individual witness independently within a few days of the sighting. The observation was reported in several books."],"Case Number":"7926","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
