I watched it for a minute as it was moving east to north and it stopped by the hills. I pointed it our to everyone around and it stayed in one spot for at least 10 minutes. We were leaving a friends house so when we left I drove in the direction I was seeing the lights and when we go there I got out my video camera and taped what we saw. It is OK video but we could see it our selves better than the video shows. I don't have a clue what it is and it is very bright."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO seen and caught on Video","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/09/2010 08:30 UTC","City":"Riverside","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-10152010-0009","Country":"United States","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.954839,+-117.393246(25913)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25913) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/15/2010 04:10 UTC"}
