It caught our eye because it didn't have the usual blink pattern of an airplane. It was a slow blink of a yellow light and it came on and off in a steady pattern and it was like someone was playing with the dimmer switch. It would slowly go from completely off to very bright, at a rate similar to a heartbeat. We watched it for a few minutes trying to be sure it wasn't an airplane, then, it just disappeared (let me note it was flying towards us and it didn't turn, it didn't fly behind a cloud or anything!) We searched the sky for a few minutes after it disappeared and couldn't find it anywhere. It was weird. If anybody knows anything about this, e-mail me.
