{"Object Shape":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my two children we were heading back home to Sacramento from relatives at 11:40 'sh from Alta Mesa Road On August 25, 2012. As I headed down Alta mesa road and then made left on Dillard heading towards highway 99 my usual route back. I was driving straight ahead when I noticed that I was in an unfamiliar area. I saw great gray brick walls to my left and came to an unfamiliar stop sign. I proceeded to drive thinking I must have passed highway 99 or something. I came to unfamiliar T intersection directing me to make left or right. It was Jackson Freeway towards east by Rancho Murietta all the way east far from my destination towards... highway 99 . I made left on Jackson pulled over at Sloughhouse and turned GPS to direct me from home from there. When I got home I realized that I had left my relatives place at 11:40 sometime and the time when I realized I was lost ( unfamiliar area) it was 12:38 midnight. I finally got home at 1 midnight with GPS. There had been a missing time experience of almost an hour I can't recall anything about. When I questioned my children about anything unusual about my driving they said no. I never drink and was super alert. It usually takes me 30 minutes to get home from Wilton to Sacramento where this day it had taken me an hour and half. I'd never experienced anything like this and find it incomprehensible."],"Longitude":"-121.197464","Case Number":"42080","Country":"United States","City":"Wilton","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42080.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42080.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/27/2012 07:03 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other,Unknown","Summary":"Missing Time 40 minutes","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"08/25/2012 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"38.435295","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wilton","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.435295,+-121.197464(42080)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42080) map </A>","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Log Number":"US-08272012-0029","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown, N/A","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
