Noticed two large orange lights appear through the treeline to East. Both Ascending Rapidly and moving South. Watched objects for several minuts as they then slowly began a slow curve to the ESE at altitude. Approx two minutes after first two lights took off a third light ascended rapidly from the same location in the distance beyond tree line. Last light joined the other two and all moved off in a easterly direction. The area it seemed to rise from is suburban with many homes, businesses etc. However no airports are in the general direction to my knowledge (having checked Google Earth to be sure.)"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-12262011-0017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.233627,+-84.159592(34325)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34325) map </A>","Latitude":"39.233627","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Goshen Ohio","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"34325","Date of the Event":"12/25/2011 07:03 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
