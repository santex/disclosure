Our house is on a canal and there is an empty lot across the canal. In the sky above the lot aprox. a mile away at aprox. 150 ft high I observed what appeared at first to be a plane. It suddenly changed direction and went the other way. I immediately realized that it was no normal flight pattern and observed it closely as it again changed direction, smoothly changing between red, blue, and green. As I observed it closer I realized it was much closer than I first thought, maybe a mile away at about 150 ft. It kept up this back and forth pattern for about 2.5 mins while it changed colors. It dipped down once while we watched then again behind the tree line. That was the last we saw of it."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"52062","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Longitude":"-81.947873","Latitude":"26.569364","Object Features":"None","Summary":"light changed from blue,red,green. changed direction smoothly","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52062.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"11/05/2013 09:47 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/05/2013 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-11052013-0014","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
