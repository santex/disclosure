{"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Pennsylvania","divs":["sighting detailsi had my camera in sports mode. exposure was set to 1\\350 and the shutter was set to 1\\362. i shot a series of six photos at this speed and in the third frame, an object appeared and was gone in the fourth frame, less than a fraction of a second later. object appears to be cigar shaped with a cone centerd on the top. it also appears to be reflecting light. i make no claims as to what it may be,(perhaps a bug or something moving very quickly) i thought that it looked odd and then i saw your t.v. show this evening about sightings in bucks county around this very time and thought you might be interested in seeing my photo. maybe with your resources you can have the photo cleaned up to show more details. i have attached three photos, one just before the object, one with the object and the one immediately after the object. look forward to hearig what you folks think. thanks for your time."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Case Number":"13964","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.210022","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13964.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13964_submitter_file1__100b5211.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13964_submitter_file2__100b5212.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13964_submitter_file3__100b5213.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13964.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/26/2008 06:16 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.210022,+-77.187965(13964)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13964) map </A>","Longitude":"-77.187965","Object Features":"Dome","Summary":"Objec appeared than disappeared in less than 1 second, I have photo.","Log Number":"US-11242008-0044","Date of the Event":"07/26/2008 06:16 UTC","trends":[""]}
