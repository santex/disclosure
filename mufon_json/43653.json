Then our entire family saw a second light flight overhead about five minutes later. I grabbed my digital video camera before the third one flew over five minutes later. To the naked eye, these appeared to be spinning, orange colored flames, without any sound. When you see the magnified video, the flames appear to have a square structure around them. These lights did not have a flashing strobe lights you see on aircraft, and didn't fall like you a flare would. I'm going to upload video and a still photo of the video. I recorded the video with my iPhone, as I displayed the original video on my tv. The date stamp on the video is off by one day. This actually occurred on November 1, 2012."],"Longitude":"-94.190794"}
