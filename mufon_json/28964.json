{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking north on Pottery Ave to my transit van pick up point (for reference of direction of sighting) when I checked my phone for the time. At which point I noticed movement in front of me, to the north, where the city of Bremerton is, which gives off a lot of light pollution. The city's lights can be seen on the clouds at night (early morning). Well, I saw that, as I looked up a dark curved object briefly come through the clouds. The clouds were an orange color and this object was completely black, it was not reflecting any light at all. As I watched (merely a few seconds)it went back into the clouds. This object was far to the north of me and looked to be of significant size. It did not completely clear the clouds so I only got to see a part of it."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Case Number":"28964","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Port Orchard","There were no other sightings in Port Orchard on or around May 5th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.545873,+-122.632629(28964)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28964) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05062011-0002","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Port Orchard","Weather Factors":"Rain","Summary":"Dark object penetrates clouds...","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28964.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28964.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/06/2011 12:49 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-122.632629","Latitude":"47.545873","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/05/2011 04:55 UTC","Region":"Washington","Country":"United States"}
