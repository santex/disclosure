It turned and went towards the NW and covered distances fast like when I saw it. It lasted close to 7 seconds, I almost ran in the house but more frightened to move then anything. No lights and it matched the clouds you wouldn't notice it driving or walking around but looking up you and staring you would. I lost sight of it when it kept going NW past the roof of the home next door.
