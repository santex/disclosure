It was completely silent. It moved in a straight line path without wavering, although it did stop abruptly at one point for about 2 or 3 seconds and then continued on the same course at the same speed that it had been prior to halting. I viewed the anomaly both with my naked eye and through my Celestron 15x70 binoculars although I could not make out any shape other than the typical spherical glow given off by any standard bulbous light source. My girlfriend saw it too."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49410.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49410.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in West Sacramento","There were no other sightings in West Sacramento on or around August 3rd 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Log Number":"US-08032013-0007","Latitude":"38.578986"}
