At 11:43 p.m., my friend said \"Look up there, do you see that?\" When I looked up, there were about 8 or maybe 9 lights aranged like a flock of geese; however, the \"angle\" shape was not perfect. The balls of light were loosely arranged. They were at somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000 feet. The formation moved soundlessly from west to east. There was nothing between the lights in the formation. The individual lights were between white and orange, and brighter than any other lights in the sky. They formation moved for a little bit less than a minute. The lights moved from horizon to horizon, I lost track of them after they passed the eastern horizon. I was stunned at seeing my first \"UFO\". Originally I thought it was an airplane, but it had to have been much larger than an airplane, possibly 10 times the size of a 727. However, It didnt have any flashing lights or landing lights."],"Longitude":"-89.777425","Case Number":"9131","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/31/2007 11:43 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Latitude":"35.15592","Region":"Tennessee","City":"Memphis","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/31/2007 11:43 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
