We walked outside to have a smoke. As we walked outside I immediately looked up at the sky and saw 3 bright orange-red lights flying in a southwesterly direction. As they flew they came together in a triangular formation and appeared to remain stationary for a about a minute. They then proceeded in a more north-northwesterly direction. As they proceeded in this direction, the two 'bottom' lights in the formation began to fade out. The top light continued to illuminate for about another 1-1.5 mintutes and then it faded out as well. No noise was present. They were at least a mile or so away from where we were standing. This was witnessed by myself and 3 other people."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
