I decided to take pictures of clouds to put it in my desktop when I noticed a bright object on the sky above the hill after I took the pictures without knowing that there was an object in the sky. It does not look like any aircraft that I know of or a bird and if you look closely a redish trail is visible. I took 3 pictures of this (the last one came alittle blureish) and if anyone has any idea of what this object can be please respond. (The picture is pretty big,I use a Sony 7.2 Megapixel Cybershot)"],"Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-119.408172","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"01/11/2007 05:45 UTC","Summary":"A bright Circle above a hill leaving a trail.","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":[""],"Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Other, Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6140.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6140_submitter_file1__ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6140_submitter_file2__ufo2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6140_submitter_file3__ufo3(blured).JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6140.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/11/2007 05:45 UTC"}
