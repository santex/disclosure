I was noticing the thin cresent moon & observed what i thought to be an unknown triangular constellation. The triangle base was aprox. 20 degrees above the horizon & tip aprox. 40 degrees. I asked the person with me what constellation it was. As i pointed it out, the lower right \"star\" started moving. It went from west slightly northwest, to a point aprox. 45 degrees toward the south, slightly southeast. At that point it turned, changed from a bright blueish white, to a amber, orange & accelerated away from earth staying at the aprox. 45 degree point in the sky. We both watched as the object went further & further away to the point of past the furthest visable star in aprox 8 to 10 seconds!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/21/2012 10:30 UTC","Longitude":"-89.626073","Tags":"City","City":"Wausau","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Wausau","There were no other sightings in Wausau on or around June 21st 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"bright blueish white light, hovered, then moved to southeast, turned & moved away from Earth rapidly","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"39721","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39721.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39721.html"],"Log Number":"US-06222012-0019","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.967393,+-89.626073(39721)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39721) map </A>"}
