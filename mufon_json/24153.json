At 9:15 PM I notice what at first I thought was a firework shot into the air, it was very bright almost flarelike. I thought it was getting ready to explode but it never did. We watched as it moved from the SW to NE. At one point it appeared that it sped up then slowed down again. Then suddenly it appeared to go verticle getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared. My wife and I both agree it was definitely not an airplane or anything else we have ever see because of how brilliant it was and the stange way in which it was flying."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24153.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24153.html"],"Case Number":"24153","City":"Port St Lucie","Longitude":"-80.35329","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Three of us watching fireworks on the 4th of July 2010 saw a very bright red-orange object move accross the sky, then suddenly go verticle and get smaller and smaller until finally disappearing.","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 12:48 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
