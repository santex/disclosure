It was so bright it just caught my eye. It went from south to north and flew low. Once I knew it wasn't a plane I told my girlfriend to look at it. We continued to watch it for another 30 or forty seconds, when it flashed and disappeared. I had enough time to grab my phone and record it but the quality of the lens doesn't allow it to be visible. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I got online right after last night but didn't want to sound like a freak. The video does have an exact time but its so dark that it didn't pick it up."],"Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.019431","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:42 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Blue Springs","There were no other sightings in Blue Springs on or around July 4th 2010"],"Summary":"Orange ball flying low south to north appeared on fire then flashed and disappeared.","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Longitude":"-94.275095","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.019431,+-94.275095(24251)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24251) map </A>","City":"Blue Springs"}
