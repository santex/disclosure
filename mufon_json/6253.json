{"Country":"Canada","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was attending a wedding reception. I happened to look up in the sky to see an object that looked strange. I asked several people, who had just begun to consume alchol, what they thought the object in the sky was and all of them looked at it and said they did not know. No one seemed too interested but me. I then retreived my camera, an epson 850Z and took this photo at 3x zoom. I then began to turn my attention to the wedding reception. The object made no sound and there was no wind at the time, which ruled out a kite. The object appeared to be about 1 mile away. When I got the photo on my computer I did a quick fix which usually enhances the colors, a strange pattern of blue green colors became visable throughout the entire photograph."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.265906,+-123.105727(6253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6253) map </A>","City":"Vancouver","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/29/2002 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/29/2002 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"6253","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Color unknown.
