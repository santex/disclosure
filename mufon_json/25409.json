We first noticed a very bright circle in the Eastern sky. When we first saw it I thought it was a planet and my husband thought it was an airplane. During our discussion we decided it wasn't an airplane because it was't blinking and it couldn't be a planet because it was slowly and consistently moving. As we were watching and discussing it, it simply disappeared in front of our eyes. It was rather startling. At that point my husband shared with me this was't the first time he had witnessed strange things in the sky. He will often times during the summer take a late night swim and lay on a lounger and watch the sky to relax and get ready for bed. I have never personally seen anything like this before. Both my husband and I are wondering if it could be a UFO?"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.861558,+-88.345055(25409)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25409) map </A>","Case Number":"25409","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Benton","There were no other sightings in Benton on or around September 13th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"09:45:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25409.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25409.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States"}
