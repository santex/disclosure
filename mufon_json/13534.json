(it may have been already descending from above the cloudline, invisible to me) it was a round, bright whitish blue light (looking very much like a star except slightly brighter). it appeared about a mile to the north of my vehicle, slightly to the west of hwy 37 approx 6 overall miles north of bloomington, in. the object descended very rapidly almost straight down. its trajectory leaned to the west slightly, by only 5 degrees. the object held its round shape perfectly. there was no streaking or trail behind it. the light remained very consistent and no flashing. after 2-3 seconds it vanished. it was probably a few hundred feet above the tree lines when it just disappeared. it just disappeared, no noise and no flash. i noticed the object because the sky was darkening and the clouds were low with a dark blue back drop. i was driving looking ahead at the road and the light caught my eye. i thought at first it was a star. as i kept driving i wondered how a star could basically just drop straight down out of the sky, below the clouds and hold its shape perfectly and quietly disappear above the trees."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/03/2008 06:12 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13534.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13534.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"saw starlike object appear below cloudline and descend rapidly and vanish","City":"Bloomington","Latitude":"39.171615","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-86.516466","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"13534","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Date of the Event":"11/03/2008 06:12 UTC"}
