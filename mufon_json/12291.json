All was normal except the ESE sky contained several objects that looked like stars moving. The objects varied from whitish yellow to multiple chromographic flashing objects. The movements appeared random to me. I'm sure they were quite far away as my binoculars added little or no details to the naked eye shapes which were star-like. The atmosphere was very clear and the view was unobstructed in my area. I first thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. With time over an hour I could tell the movement was in the objects as the other stars did not move like the objects did. I have no clue what they were other than UFO's. If you know, I'd like to know. You may email i44300@yahoo.com I plan to observe again tonight."],"Case Number":"12291","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/31/2008 03:30 UTC"}
