She sleeps in the bed with my wife and I and she was awake and restless around 4-ish. I took her outside on our back porch hoping she would go to the yard. As she started to pee on the concrete, i picked her up and walked out into the yard and sat her down, and patiently awaited numbers 1 and 2 from the little pup. The skies were mostly clear so I took a deep breath the fresh air we have at night lately and was looking up to the south when something like a fast moving bird coming from the east caught the corner of my eye and in a split second as I started to look toward it... the \"bird\" (which it clearly wasnt)lit up and became a washed out amber (very bright almost white)streak that then became two streaks that were connected at both ends like an oval(open in the middle) then shifted back to a single streak before the lights went dark and the object shot off into the west, and it appeared to be going higher into the sky during this sighting. I was able to see it after the lights blacked out for a split second just as I did when it caught my eye initially. The speed was faster that any jet fighter that I have ever seen (been to may airshows) and left me with some serious goosebumps."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Flash","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around August 9th 2008"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.771596,+-86.148974(12023)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12023) map </A>"}
