Only car on the road, and we noticed it when we went over the hill. I thought it was a helicopter or a blimp with a banner. It was rectangular amber colored, and sat in the air with no sound or movement. It had a row of windows outlined in black, and the smaller ones that were lined up behind it also had the same description. I didnt say anything to my friend that i saw the windows, but he said \"It even had windows\" then i knew we both saw it and i wasnt seeing things. It then took off swiftly, changed into a ball of light about the size of the white moon, and came toward the truck in the sky From the NW. Then it turned and took off SW and was gone. I wasnt panicked the whole time, but i was glad when it was gone. The next day i read in the laffeyette paper that it was a meteor, but i didnt believe that, because meteors dont take off in other directions and they dont sit in the air without sound, and windows. The size was about the size of a helicopter."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6120.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6120.html"],"Latitude":"41.05143","Log Number":"US-01092007-0009","Longitude":"-86.603065","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.05143,+-86.603065(6120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6120) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/18/1989 10:45 UTC","City":"Winamac","Summary":"Rectangular Amber colored, sitting in air, no sound, and no movement","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Winamac","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana"}
