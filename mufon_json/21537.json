My fiance observed a strange red moon like object in the sky at about 20-30��� from the ground to the southwest. It appeared to be and upside down waxing crescent moon phase (appearing like a very thin smiley face, cheshire cat like almost) and was not moving in the slightest. She told me \"wow look at the moon\" so I looked up and noticed what she was talking about but didn't think much of it. A couple minutes later we looked up to see the object again and it was no where to be found. We thought maybe there were some trees impeding our view, but there were not many trees ahead of us, and we also drove for a considerable amount of time without ever seeing it again. We also considered cloud coverage to be the reason for the disappearance only to look up and see nothing but stars in the sky. We looked around to see if it was possibly the moon and we could not locate it anywhere. Does anyone know if the moon can cause this kind of phenomenon? Or could this be a UFO siting?"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.891159","Summary":"Moon like object observed in the sky.","Case Number":"21537","Date Submitted":"01/18/2010 11:31 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"01/17/2010 08:00 UTC","Region":"Indiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21537.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21537.html"],"Log Number":"US-01182010-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.891159,+-86.903894(21537)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21537) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
