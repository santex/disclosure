October 20, 2008. 22:30 hrs. EDST. Witness (C.C.) was outside walking her dog when a distant bright object caught her attention. It appeared to be a bright white glowing ball, with fuzzy edges or an aura, about the size of the moon. She continued to watch the object move slowly (2 mph?) over the town, while continuing her walk. When the object passed over the nearby Royal Bank at a height of approximately 100 feet, she realized it wasn't an airplane or helicopter (silent, no blinking lights), so she ran back to her home to get a pair of binoculars. By the time the witness ran back outside, the object had disappeared. C.C. felt excited and confused (seeing things?)after her sighting."],"Region":"Ontario","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18812.html"],"Country":"Canada","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Forest","There was one other sighting in Forest on or around October 20th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.103029","Date Submitted":"10/20/2008 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.991643","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
