This from the general direction of the airport and with their aspect reckoned they were National Guard jets. Did not think about it until they manueved to the south, then back west, no sound. Watched about thirty seconds with my friend and then they were gone. No flapping wings, hard to tell how high but looked like about 3k feet up."],"Latitude":"36.157782","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oklahoma","Tags":"City","Summary":"flying in tandem, silvery orbs, disappeared suddenly","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"13437"}
