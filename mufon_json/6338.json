{"Longitude":"-74.004773","divs":["sighting detailson march 17th 2002, while on a church crossing for work (i'm a police officer) i saw a ufo over my patrol vehicle. at first i thought it was a helicopter since it remained stationary in the sky. i activated my patrol car video camera and taped the object, moving my patrol vehicle several times to keep it in the view finder (128x magnification). it appeared to be diamond shaped. the object then started to float away, but did not bob or spin as if it were a baloon. that's really what made me think it was 'odd' and the reason i taped it. i don't know where else to report\\submit this. i have seen several shows, including the one with actor dan ackaroid and saw the same object that i have on tape\\cd on his film. i can be contacted at my above e-mail address. steve"],"Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Case Number":"6338","Date Submitted":"03/17/2002 11:28 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6338.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6338.html"],"City":"New York","Latitude":"40.718953","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around March 17th 2002"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.718953,+-74.004773(6338)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6338) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02072007-0006","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Diamond","Summary":"caught on film","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"03/17/2002 11:28 UTC"}
