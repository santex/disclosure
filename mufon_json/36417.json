Filmed using a Sony Cyber Shot H70 Digital Camera featuring a Bionz processor in 720p HD \"Fine\" quality. I zoomed in on the object fully with the 10x Optical Zoom with Optical Steady Shot. At the very start of the video, the object was already very high in the sky and even higher towards the end of the video, i stopped filming as i could not see it with the naked eye and the camera kept on getting out of focus as it was (by then) too far away. It kept changing its shape and its size, at one point looking like a shirt and also at another point looking like some kind of animal. This is NOT a flying piece of trash or rubbish, objects like that cannot go so far into the sky and keep on ASCENDING even further, especially as their was hardly any wind in the air, it was an extremely pleasant hot day.
