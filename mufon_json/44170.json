I decided to look at the stars when out of nowhere a bright glowing white object appeared above me. My dogs seemed to freeze on the spot, and they all stopped barking at once. This frightened me, the object seemed to pulsate and glow a bluish white light so bright I could not see the exterior. I couldn't move,then suddenly the object changed direction and flew to the East, and in an instant was out of sight. The dogs started walking around and I called them inside. They stayed by my side and slept with me all night. I'm sure it was a UFO that was hovering above the power lines that night.I am still afraid to go out there alone at night."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Latitude":"41.661729","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44170.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44170.html"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Reliance","There were no other sightings in Reliance on or around June 20th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"11/27/2012 12:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","Case Number":"44170"}
