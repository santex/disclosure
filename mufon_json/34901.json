It suddenly leveled off and slowed to almost a hover. Then 2 smaller orbs began to move around and come into view. The 2 smaller orbs maneuvered around the larger object. The larger object maintained a fairly straight course moving slowly at roughly a mile away. It was between 1 and 2 thousand feet in altitude. All three objects suddenly and rapidly ascended and vanished. The larger one dimmed out as it ascended fading momentarily into a dim blue before completely vanishing.The entire event lasted for a few minutes."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34901.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34901_submitter_file1__orbs1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34901_submitter_file2__orbs2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34901.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-111.089911","Region":"Arizona","Case Number":"34901","Date of the Event":"01/15/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Saucer Or Orb with short wings, accompanied by 2 smaller orbs.","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.052948,+-111.089911(34901)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34901) map </A>","Latitude":"34.052948","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
