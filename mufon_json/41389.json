I was sleeping when i herd a whirling, rushing sound, kinda like a water generator. I woke up , but was paralyzed and could not move. My window was open as it was summertime. I herd what sounded like a craft about 12-15 ft. above my window, very close. I then began to heard shuffling footsteps. Shortly after i herd two or three voices. Kinda human but robotic sounding. I could not make out there words, it was in a foreign language that I have never herd, but was very pronounce and definitely they were talking things over, calmly like they were planning or questioning. Don't know how I knew this, but I did. I never left my room and about what appeared to be 5 to 10 minutes later, after their conversation. I herd it escalate pulsate and leave. Very weird.Since for years I never believed in UFO's. I have two other times something happened to me after this even, one in 2005 in Boise Idaho another in AZ. Too much to write, quite disturbing and one physical event."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date of the Event":"08/09/2003 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.255477,+-122.436831(41389)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41389) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"08/03/2012 12:57 UTC","Log Number":"US-08032012-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
