From the north i noticed a very long skinny object emitting a lot of heat moving very slowly to the south. I watched this object for about 5 minutes as it crossed the horizon. No trail was left by the object and i could not hear anything (It was a very quiet morning). I gathered a few of my coworkers as i felt that this was something that was needed to be seen to be believed. We all witnessed the object make a turn to the east and disappear after about 30 seconds. As soon as the object disappeared another object became visible from the north meeting almost the exact same description. It followed the same path and took about the same amount of time to finish the path and disappear. This occurred with a total of 5 objects. About 10 minutes after the 5th object disappeared a jet flew over the vicinity."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
