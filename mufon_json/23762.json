( the 2 dull white light were round in shape) and thats it."],"Date of the Event":"09/12/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-06152010-0003","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/15/2010 01:26 UTC","Longitude":"-114.740571","Latitude":"44.073042","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Idaho","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.073042,+-114.740571(23762)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23762) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"IFO"}
