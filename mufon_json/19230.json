This was my second sighting in a year and my third sighting in my life. I find them to be very interesting and after noticing these latest objects I hope to see them again."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.893037","Longitude":"-78.869749","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.893037,+-78.869749(19230)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19230) map </A>","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Buffalo","There were no other sightings in Buffalo on or around September 8th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
