My son, his girlfriend, the friend who was walking to the house and myself went outside to watch the light. It was stationary in the sky, fairly far away from us. It seemed like it was over the southwest suburbs of Chicago (perhaps Interstate 55 and Lemont Road. It was at about a 40 degree angle in the sky. It did not seem to be an airplane, since it did not move. The light changed kept changing colors between white, red, blue and green. The colors seemed to be rotating vertically rather than horizontily. There seemed to be a beam of light coming out of the right side of the light. Since the light was so far away, we could not make out any details. We watched the light for about 20 minutes. It did not move much during that time. We finally just went back into the house. I'm not sure what it was but it was curious."]}
