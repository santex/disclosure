When I saw the object I thought it was a plane or helicopter. It was moving very slowing from north to south and was flying at a low altitude where non comercial airplanes or helicopters would fly. I watched it for about a minute when it just vanished. It was colored orange and was glowing. No lights where blinking on it and we were a couple of miles away from its actual position in the sky, but I am guessing it had to be really large. For me to be able to see it. I guess my feelings when I saw it could be compared to when a dog sees a car. Excited. I mentioned to my husband that their was something in the sky, but being a skeptic he won't believe they exist unless one lands in the front yard and abducts him. I just sat in my seat and watched it. It was around 9:00 when I saw the object, and think it did reappear a couple of minutes later, but I lost sight of through the tree line."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Kankakee","There were no other sightings in Kankakee on or around July 3rd 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"07/03/2009 09:01 UTC","Latitude":"41.127542","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Saw an orange ball glow in the sky moving and then disappearing.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18077.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18077.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/03/2009 09:01 UTC","Case Number":"18077","Log Number":"US-07142009-0011","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
