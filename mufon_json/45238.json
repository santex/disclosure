They were so low on the horizon that at first I had mistakenly thought they were street lights, same color and seemed round in shape. I then noticed another set above the first, they were identical to the first set and slightly to the west. Each light in each set was evenly spaced. As I watched another set appeared to the east of the first. At this time the original, most lowest set started to dim out. They didn't fly away or move at all, just simply faded. A third set of 2 lights then appeared to the west and just after that set seemed to reach its brightest the most highest set then dimmed out. I grew up on Air Force bases around the world. Ive seen F-16s line up for landings at night. I am also somewhat aware of what an F-35 can do. I certainly know what flares look like. I have no clue what these 8 lights were. The did not move or twinkle, they glowed. When they started to dim I would look for signs of normal aircraft lights and could not see the usual red or white lights. I did take some horrible cell phone video but haven't a clue how to get in on the computer to upload here."],"Log Number":"US-01162013-0004","Summary":"Glowing amber lights over southwest phoenix","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/16/2013 12:22 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.051718,+-111.092221(45238)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45238) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/15/2013 07:35 UTC","Longitude":"-111.092221"}
