And people in our apt. complex knocked on doors and nearly everyone there saw these objects. And you could see most of the towns people were looking up at these objects. For the next three evenings the local news station KNOE Tv 8 had the incident on the news. The third night they announced that they had talked to the airforce at barksdale AFB and they denied any knowledge of the event. After they anounced this news they never mentioned it again.
