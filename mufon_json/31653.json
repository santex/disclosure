Continued the stroll checking periodically and it remained. Put poochies to bed came back out with coffee and it was still there sort of pulsing and changing from really bright to slightly duller and back again. It appeared to be moving in a small erratic pattern while at its brightest. This continued for almost 2 hours it never moved. Went in to refill coffee and pooooof it was gone no trace in sight.
