{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsmy son and i were driving towards graham, tx, on hwy 380 about 3 miles out of graham proper. i am an avid night sky watcher so when i noticed an extremely bright star\\planet about 40��� above the horizon to the northwest, i was surprised. i indicated it to my son and told him that's got to be a planet because of the brightness, but i'd never remembered seeing such a bright light in that part of the sky at this time of the year. as we got into graham and stopped for gas (about 4 minutes from first sighting it) i noticed that the light had turned pink\\red as it would do if it were getting lower to the horizon and atmospherics colored it a bit. about two minutes after that it vanished and unless it's the fastest planet in the solar system i don't know what it could have been. i've just now used an interactive sky chart and there is nothing there that could have explained it (note: constellation lynx is close to where it was). there was no obvious movement, just the rapid color changes and the apparent disappearance of the object\\star\\planet. end of report."],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"09/27/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Graham","There were no other sightings in Graham on or around September 27th 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-09292008-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12838.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12838.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Looked like an extremely bright star/planet, white going to red","Date Submitted":"09/27/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Graham","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.10706,+-98.589502(12838)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12838) map </A>","Latitude":"33.10706","Case Number":"12838","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Longitude":"-98.589502"}
