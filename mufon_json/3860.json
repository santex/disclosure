{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.957998","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving on Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake, taking pictures of the buffalo. My wife said to me, \"Something strange is happening to that cloud,\" and so I snapped two shots of it. I didn't really think anything more of it at the time. When the picture was developed I noticed the object at the top of the frame, which I hadn't seen at the time. There is a second object, visible in the photo which appears to have been vectoring to intercept the primary object, but was no where near quick enough. It is visible at the very bottom of the frame."],"Region":"Utah","Date Submitted":"07/31/2005 11:30 UTC","Summary":"Object sliced through a cloud","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.957998,+-112.20717(3860)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3860) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09192005-0001","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Antelope Island","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3860.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3860.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3860","Source":"MUFON","City":"Antelope Island","Date of the Event":"07/31/2005 11:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-112.20717","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Undisclosed"}
