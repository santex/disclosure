Myself and another worker were left behind to watch over the boxes that were left behind. we were sitting down taking a break, the workers from the dealership then came out to have a cigarrate (about 4 people) when i one of them ;an asian lady, say : oh my god look! so i looked up at the sky and there it was. an enormous flying disc hovering behind a two cypress trees. the disc after hovering for about 10 seconds, turned sideways, now looking like a circle rather than a disc. the disc then decended behind the cypress trees. and a split second later a bright golden sphere apeared from the sky at light speed and flew around the sky looking for the flying saucer . the sphere then ascended and disapeared in the sky. by that time we were all engaged in a conversation. we were all amazed . but that incident left me thinking that perhaps these ufo's are at odds with eachother. like at war or something. i mean why would one hide from the other?"],"Date of the Event":"11/20/2007 12:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-10292010-0013","Summary":"silver metalic flying disc hiding from a bright golden sphere","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":[],"Object Features":"Window(s)","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/29/2010 02:31 UTC","Case Number":"26193","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784401,+-119.409912(26193)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26193) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
