Today my son came for a visit. He and one of his roommates along with two others who live in Granisle and Tatchet watched the UFO's across the lake for quite a while this evening around 6pm. They were really very active. Later, not sure of the time, another person from Tatchet and a friend of his watched with us while we witnessed a white streak of light come out of the cloud and as it got close to the ground it split in two like a fork and appeared to land over by the mine. My husband contacted me and said he had a solid orb in his bathroom at the logging camp tonight. Tonight from home my family watched them at the lake on and off until 3 am Tuesday morning."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Granisle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9570.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9570.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/17/2007 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/17/2007 10:00 UTC","Latitude":"54.893125","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Granisle","There were 4 other sightings in Granisle on or around December 17th 2007"],"Longitude":"-126.198718","Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"9570","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Flash, Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"White light shoots across sky, splitting in two and lands near mine"}
