We always stand out there at all times because of our amazing view. When I came out we watched 5 of these bright orbs that made no sound at all fly by slowly. Each one showed up within 30 seconds of each other. When one would be out of view for the 30 seconds the next would come over the horizon. I have seen every type of plane or air craft fly over and around my home. This is like nothing I ever seen! They were glowing so bright! I have no idea what it was!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"5 Glowing red balls over Worcester seconds apart.","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.275056","Region":"Massachusetts","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:40:08","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51632.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51632.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Circle, Other","Longitude":"-71.785611","Date Submitted":"10/18/2013 08:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-10182013-0008","Date of the Event":"10/17/2013 07:15 UTC","Case Number":"51632"}
