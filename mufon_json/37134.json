At first i believed them to be helicopters, but a helicopter could not replicate the rapid changes in direction these objects made. I kept my eyes on them, and they were swooping around each other, almost like a dance, getting close then moving back out, always smoothly but rapidly. We turned off of Marine Drive continuing to our destination and I lost sight of the objects."],"City":"Portland","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.585741","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37134.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37134.html"],"Case Number":"37134","Summary":"3 spheres swooping around each other over Portland International Airport","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.59877,+-122.585741(37134)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37134) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/05/2012 12:43 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/01/2012 07:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"45.59877","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Oregon","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like"}
