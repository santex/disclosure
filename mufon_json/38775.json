The triangular object appeared to be banked as it made a sweeping turn, at a high rate of speed. The object was climbing and eccelerating from East to South East away from where I stood and seemed to accelerate rapidly. The object progressivley accelerated from an already unnaturaly fast rate of speed to faster than the eye could track it. As it accelerated - it zipped out of sight, into the distance. The entire encounter lasted anywhere from 6 to 10 seconds. When I first saw the object it stook out to me as something that appeared foreign in nature, like no conventional aircraft that I know of. From what I can tell the object was so black, that it stood out against the low clouds and even gaps of night sky. There were no lights of any kind, nor after burner heat visuals. The way the object moved away from my position - had it been a conventional aircraft, I would have, or should have seen glow from the turbine engines. Based on the speed and look of the object - I am forced to believe in something that I don't believe, which is the craft is a UFO."],"Latitude":"43.813443","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Looking up at sky just above horizon saw black triangular object.","Date Submitted":"06/03/2012 03:59 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Oregon","Tags":"City","Case Number":"38775","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.813443,+-120.548861(38775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38775) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-120.548861","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06032012-0007","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/02/2012 11:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
