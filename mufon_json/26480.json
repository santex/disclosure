Until tonight. I have lived in Canada for 18 years now and have never seen a sight like this. At this very time outside of my home you can see approx 50 objects of the likes i have never seen. 3 of the objects are low enough to give definition of its shape and and the rest are high. Normally you would say balloon or aircraft. However, folks i have never seen an aircraft or balloon that can emit these kinds of lights. They are defiantly out there moving around yet clearly in the formation of a road and they are encompassing an spherical area so that they can clearly be seen. Well take note i have seen it and it is exciting yet unnerving to say the least"],"Log Number":"CA-11092010-0029","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cone, Disc, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"London"}
