I had gone out to see my daughter and her friend drive away to a friend's party. As I was walking back to my front door - I noticed a bright orange light just east of my house. At first I thought it was an airplane, but the lights were much different from the many airplane lights that I have seen. The lights seemed to get bigger and the orange color brighter after just watching it for about 5 - 10 seconds. The light was a glowing bright orange ball and slowly moving over my neighbors��� houses about 500 feet on the sky. Light was moving west bound and then slowly moved south bound towards 145th street. Light did not make a sound and it did not have blinking lights as you would see on an airplane. After about 10 - 15 seconds of watching the light in awe, I ran to the front door and called for my wife to come out and see. My wife came out and saw the light as it slowly moved south bound towards Lockport and disappearing in the horizon. I then called 911 to report it at about 10:40 p.m. I asked the answering office if there were any other calls reporting the light over the sky and I was told that there had been one other call making the same report. I am not claiming that I saw a UFO ��� but it sure was not an airplane. I would really like to know what I saw."],"City":"Lemont"}
