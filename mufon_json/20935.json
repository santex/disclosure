The triangle edges were rounded, not a sharp point. the lights in each corner were off whit and circular in shape. The circular light in the center seemed brighter. It hovered over the road for over a minute. We pulled over and turned around to watch it stop hovering and travel SW towards West seattle. At first we thought it might be an airplane but ruled that out bc there were no flashing lights on it and it seemed way to low and far from the airport. then we thougt it might be a helicopter but as we got closer and then directly under it and realized that it wasn't a helicopter. I felt scared bc I couldn't find an explanation for what it could be. My friend was in aww and couldn't believe what we were seeing... we wanted to see more....but it began to move SW."],"Latitude":"47.60844","City":"Seattle","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.60844,+-122.322451(20935)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20935) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/10/2009 01:26 UTC"}
