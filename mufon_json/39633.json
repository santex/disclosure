So I went to the front of my house to look for the orange orb that I saw there previously and less than a minute later I saw the solid, orange, glowing, non-blinking ball traveling West to East again. However, this time I noticed it hover a second and slightly adjust path from it straight line and then descend below the tree-line and out of view. At 10:58pm , I was back in my back yard and noticed a bright flash of light in a constellation that was low in the southeastern sky. The week before I observed a dark object traveling through the sky and then flashing when it hit the handle of the Big Dipper constellation."],"Summary":"Another Solid Orange Orb flying West to East","Log Number":"US-06202012-0015","Date Submitted":"06/20/2012 04:26 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-83.093624","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ohio","City":"Grove City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
