{"Log Number":"US-01162008-0002","Date of the Event":"08/20/1996 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"32.60758","divs":["sighting detailsi am contacting you regarding what appears to be a plaster of paris mold made of an alien���s head that my brother and i currently have in our possession. my brother found it while hiking in the ���back country��� in east san diego county in 1996. he came across it while hiking in an open area\\meadow and kicked it over, thinking it was some kind of whitish rock. when he did, he saw that it was hollow inside, so he took it home. we later examined its interior using a couple mirrors and lamps and saw that it was an apparently unbroken plaster mold made by ���plastering��� the large, oblong, lobed head of an alien-looking creature. although it is a bit difficult seeing around inside the large, heavy plaster cast, the eyes and nostrils are clearly visible by looking in at an angle through the neck opening, as well as bony-looking brow protuberances above each eye, two ���lobe��� impressions at the back of the inner scull, prominent ridges running crosswise along the length of the inside of the cranium, and many features that look like the impressions made by folds and wrinkles in the skin of the neck and so forth. we have no idea whatsoever as to whether this is a cast of a genuine alien���s head or some simple joke, fraud, artistic endeavor, or whatnot. at the time we found it there certainly didn���t seem to have been any efforts made by anyone to exploit it in any way. it seems to us that one possible explanation is that one or more individuals came across a dead alien and buried it with its head sticking up out of the ground (or found it in that condition) and returned with plastering materials and encased the head in plaster. it would seem then that the plaster mold was never retrieved and that over time the materials composing the alien���s head simply deteriorated and were eaten away such that by the time my brother came across the plaster cast it was still intact and yet empty. when my brother found it the open, neck part was partially buried in the ground while the covering of the ���skull��� was barely visible above the surrounding grass. but of course this is all shear speculation. at the time my brother found this oddity and brought it to my mother���s home in campo, ca, my mother was dying of cancer and we were caring for her during her final days. our mother was a very religious person (christian, protestant) and in her weakened state she imagined that the cast was an evil presence and she did not want it in or around her house. she was not satisfied until my brother had heaved it out into a field nearby our house. that was in 1996, the year our mother died. until two weeks ago i had assumed that strange plaster cast had been lost to us for good, but i have thought about it many times and have wished we could have had it examined by some experts. we still own my mother���s old house, although it has not been kept up or lived in a number of years. in visiting there a few times over the years i have walked the field where we through that cast, but i could never find it. over this past holiday season (christmas 2007) my brother was visiting the old house in campo when he came across something wrapped in a bundle of garbage bags in a corner of the covered carport. when he opened all the bags he found that old plaster cast we hadn���t seen in all those years. the only explanation for this i can think of is that over the months my mother was dying we had many family members coming and going and apparently one of more of them found the mold and stored it away in protective garbage bags. all i can say is good for them. i can���t say that we hold out a terribly great expectation that this is truly a cast made of an alien���s head, but we���ve just got to know ��� one way or another. i have been an avid listener of the art bell show for many years and have heard some good things about mufon ��� so i thought i would start with our local branch right here in san diego. i���m sure this is not the typical sort of case you deal with, but maybe you could steer us in the right direction in finding someone who could determine just what this thing we have is. we would appreciate any help you could give us. i have enclosed three photos with brief descriptions: pict #1: photo of the face which is located inside the end of the cast with the large, protruding, frontal lobe. you can see the two eyes halfway down the photo, with the nostrils located between, a little lower than the eyes. there is some sort of brow-like protuberance above and to the inside of each eye. pict #2: photo looking down into neck hole of the cast. you can some of the cranium ridges and some of the wrinkles in the neck. pick #3: photo showing cast in position in which it was found ��� with neck opening on bottom. (apple added to give size perspective.) the cranial lobe to the right (the frontal lobe, containing the face) is at least twice as large as the one to the left (the back of the head). there are two small lobe (saucer-like) impressions at the back of the head inside.] thanks for the help, arthur leach"],"Case Number":"8916","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-116.469732","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"FOUND WHAT APPEARS TO BE A PLASTER CAST OF AN ALIEN HEAD","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.60758,+-116.469732(8916)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8916) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"CAMPO, CA","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8916.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8916_submitter_file1__HEAD1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8916_submitter_file2__HEAD2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8916_submitter_file3__HEAD3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8916.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/20/1996 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","trends":["There have been no other sightings in CAMPO, CA","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States"}
