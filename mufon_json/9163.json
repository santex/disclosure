I mostly shared it with only my opened minded friends. The incident was somewhat disturbing to me and I kind of wanted to keep it to myself. It happen in McAlister Park San Antonio on date a time noted on this form. Resent incident in Texas and San Antonio have convinced me to share this story. I also view your organization as a creditable to properly investigate this base on resent news stories.I would like to retain my anonymity for now but will corporate with any investigate. I was in my favorite park today and I went to look for the black stone I had thrown away there. When I reached the spot were I recalled throwing it I realized that the brush there was pretty thick. Yet I had a strong urge to negotiate the brush and fine the stone. So I assumed the stone was calling me. As I found my way deep into the brush to the spot I felt I was being called to I began to look on the ground. I glanced up for a second a noticed what seemed to be an insect made purely of light. It flew directly in front of my face and paused as though it was trying to give me a better look. I looked harder. ���Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!!��� I said out loud. ���What is that?!��� I continued. Then it suddenly occurred to me to ask it. ���What are you?��� I asked the little light thingy. ���I am a fairy,��� it replied telepathically. My thoughts and feelings where in an uproar. The thing began to fill my head with wisdom and information which at the time was clear but now seems vague. ���Why are these things happening to me? I done completely lost my mind this time. No one will ever believe this one.��� Just then the light thingy spoke again, ���Take a picture��� it said. As a pulled out my camera phone to take the picture it flew right up to the lens. Just then I saw that there were two of these things. As I watched the one on the right the other one flew off two the left. The one on the right disappeared. I looked to my left to see if the other one had disappeared also. It was no where to be found. ���Here I am��� it said. I looked at a leaf on a tree and there it was. It looked like a small piece of lint or something so I blew on it. I didn���t move. I blew on it again. It didn���t move again. ���Take another picture if you���d like��� it said. I did. I was about to place the leaf with the light thingy back in the tree when it said, ���I want to go with you���. I switched the leaf with the FAIRY on it to my other hand in order to reach in my pocket to clear a space to carry it. My intention was to put this thing under a microscope and do a complete investigation. All on the sudden I felt a burning sensation on my hand with the leaf in it. The fairy had crawled on to my hand and it was burning me. My reflexes took control and tried to brush it away. I smashed it and it was spread across the palm of my hand. I had I feeling of great sadness come over me and was begging for forgiveness and understanding. The area on my hand where to thing was smashed was still burning. As I reached to wipe it off on my pants,��� it said, ���Rub me on your skin around your heart���. After I complied with its instructions it said, ���Now you can take me with you���. Update: since this incident I have been compelled to pick up trash on the ground. I even pulled my car over one time and cleaned up the garbage that was thrown in a wooded area. Today at the post office I picked up all the trash out front. I was just there to mail a letter. I���m also finding the information given to me at the time can be recalled if I am asked the correct question. I did not included this in the story but when you look at the picture please note that the dead leaf began to come to life as the being crawled up the leaf."]}
