We watched it move off into the distance moving south. Shortly after there was another and my wife was scared and went into the house I followed but only to grab my sony handycam with night shot. I sat in the tub waiting and it was about five minutes there was another and then five minutes and another. I shot video of it not able to see anything except the lights. Later I took the video and loaded it to my computer and saw little then I used software to put it into ultr violet light that is when I saw how huge this thing was and the outline and details of the craft. I printed a few hard copy pictures and then saved everything to the hard drive."],"City":"Twinsburg","Date of the Event":"11/10/1996 08:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45757.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Twinsburg","There were no other sightings in Twinsburg on or around November 10th 1996"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02172013-0025","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.313732,+-81.451503(45757)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45757) map </A>","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-81.451503","Summary":"(GS) Saw 4 to five huge triangular objects fly from north to south directly over me while sitting in hot tub took video and pictures stored on hard drive","Latitude":"41.313732","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"02/17/2013 10:14 UTC"}
