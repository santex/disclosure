{"Summary":"Amazing bright orange light in the sky. Hovered before flying off.","Longitude":"-72.901731","Object Shape":"Circle","divs":["Sighting DetailsOut for a walk through suburban neighborhood with five friends. Somone pointed to the sky at an orange glowing circle. It was brighter than any stars. There were air planes in the sky too for reference. It was much brighter and not blinking, but the same size of the planes. It seemed to hover oddly then fly off across the sky . We followed it past some tree lines and it either vanished or got too far away. Many of the witnesses initially thought it was a crashing plane on fire. Possibly metor but didn't seem too move fast enough and lingered in the sky."],"City":"Cheshire","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08092011-0043","Date of the Event":"07/23/2011 10:35 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Cheshire","There were no other sightings in Cheshire on or around July 23rd 2011"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30319.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 10:34 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Connecticut","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"30319","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.514292,+-72.901731(30319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30319) map </A>","Latitude":"41.514292"}
