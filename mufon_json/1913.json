I always gaze up at the stars...its an interest. In the distance Inoticed what would have certainly passed for three stars, only these were movingin an exact triangular formation, at one speed and completely synchronized. Coming from the North, I watched as they maintained this exact formation acrossthe sky, and beyond my vision. The entire sighting lasted about 3 minutes. These objects did not blink, they just moved directly across the night sky at analtitude that appeared almost the same as the stars themselves...it looked asthough they were moving through other stars...I know that is not possible, butthat is the optical illusion that my ground perspective yielded."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Hazlet","There were no other sightings in Hazlet on or around October 2nd 2002"],"Log Number":"","Latitude":"40.415664"}
