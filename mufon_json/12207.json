I looked out over the near by Mountain, Mt. Solo, Because I could see a storm system moving in from the west. I was on my Cell Phone talking to my Fiancee at the time. Hovering over the mountain was a bright orange fireball. It did not move for three to four minutes. I had to look away for a second to check something, I work in Security and have certin Responsibilities, and when I turned back it was gone. A few days later I was looking at a Photo posted to Coast to Coast AM's website of the same type of object over Mt. Adams on the same night. When I first saw the object I passed it off as a play of the setting sun on the incoming storm, but, after seeing the Photo, and that the photo was taken on the same night, I knew that it was not something Normal."],"Longitude":"-122.938167","Case Number":"12207","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Longview","There were no other sightings in Longview on or around June 21st 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Object Shape":"Fireball","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.138168,+-122.938167(12207)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12207) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"06/21/2008 09:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12207.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12207.html"]}
