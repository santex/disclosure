The object was spotted by someone in the boat. We had no idea what we were looking at. The object was in the southern sky. It did not seem to be moving but our boat was moving so it was hard to tell. The object was a oval white circle with a white cone at the bottom. It also seemed to be misty or in a cloud but the night was clear and crisp. A couple of minutes after we noticed it the light, it just dimmed and we could not see it any more. Another group that was returning from another location on the lake saw the same thing. My first impression was a comet but the direction and size of the cone I knew it was not a comet.We were all pretty mater of fact about the siting after when talking about it that we had no idea what we saw and it could be something from the Americian space program or something we just can't explain."],"Log Number":"CA-09202009-0058","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.055857,+-77.854881(19518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19518) map </A>","City":"Bancroft","Case Number":"19518","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"a light with a cone shape below it","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bancroft","There were no other sightings in Bancroft on or around September 19th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19518.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19518.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"45.055857","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 07:55 UTC","Country":"Canada"}
