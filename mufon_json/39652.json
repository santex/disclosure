{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-06202012-0024","Longitude":"-78.892873","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were sitting outside on the front patio, when someone looked up and said \"What is that?\" and we all looked up to see this bright orange fireball travelling very quickly across the sky. The fireball did not lose altitude or speed as it flew across the sky. We were able to see it until it traveled out of sight. A few of us insist the object seemed to simply vanish while some of us think it flew beyond distance of our sight. It appeared to gain some altitude as it went along. There was no sound we could hear, and there was no diminishing of the color or brightness, and no apparent trail behind it. It was flying lower than a plane would, and we live fairly close to the airport."],"Date Submitted":"06/20/2012 11:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/20/2012 10:20 UTC","Summary":"Orange fireball travelling fast across sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Tonawanda","There was one other sighting in Tonawanda on or around June 20th 2012"],"Case Number":"39652","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39652.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39652.html"],"Latitude":"42.983813","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.983813,+-78.892873(39652)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39652) map </A>","City":"Tonawanda","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York"}
