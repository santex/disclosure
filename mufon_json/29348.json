As I was looking towards the western sky I noticed a cluster of lights that at first looked like the Little Dipper. The formation got bigger and closer at a fast rate of speed, it appeared and was out of sight in less than ten seconds. It took up as much space in the sky as a 747 would, however, it was very high up in the sky. The Body of the craft seemed to be somewhat translucent but not see through. It was not a complete V-shape, the left wing was only half as long as the right. The right wing had five lights on it and the left wing had three lights. The lights were somewhat dim. It was moving from west to east and vanished with no sound or trace."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Montclair","Date of the Event":"06/02/2011 01:19 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-06022011-0004","Disposition":"IFO"}
