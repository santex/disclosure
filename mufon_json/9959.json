I was looking at the moon in the daylight and noticed a very small object passing infront of it. The object had to be at the outer boundries of our atmosphere, a grain of sand held at arms length could have blocked out the object. The object was an orange-red color, going south very slowly compared to a satellite. I checked out Heavens Above to see if anything was passing in that location at that time and there wasn't anything."],"City":"Saratoga","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Tags":"City","Summary":"An orange object passed infront of the moon and continued south.","Disposition":"Hoax","Longitude":"-122.019305","Case Number":"9959","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Saratoga","There was one other sighting in Saratoga on or around March 16th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.273182,+-122.019305(9959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9959) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9959.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9959.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
