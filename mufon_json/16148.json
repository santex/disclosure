{"Object Shape":"Fireball","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe are truckdrivers. We were delivering to Fairburn, Ga. and just below the airport. It couldn't have been a plane because this object was perfectly spherical but huge. It was fell before I could get my camera out. Traffic was heavy surely others saw it. It fell slower than a shooting star and was blue and yellow with a long trailing blue white tail. The event lasted about 45 sec. and we heard no noise. There was no explosion."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16148.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16148.html"],"Case Number":"16148","Date Submitted":"03/19/2009 02:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.755405","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.755405,+-84.382432(16148)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16148) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/19/2009 02:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Georgia","Log Number":"US-03212009-0006","Longitude":"-84.382432","Summary":"Lg. descending yellow fireball with long blue/white tail.","trends":["There have been 95 other sightings in Atlanta","There was one other sighting in Atlanta on or around March 19th 2009"],"City":"Atlanta","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
