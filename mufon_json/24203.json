(and no, i was not drinking!)"],"Summary":"Red/orange bright light across sky.... no noise at all.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.078115,+-79.790545(24203)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24203) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24203.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24203.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24203","Latitude":"36.078115","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-79.790545","City":"Greensboro","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 02:14 UTC","Region":"North Carolina"}
