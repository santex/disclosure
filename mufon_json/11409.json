{"divs":["sighting detailsmy son and i were walking home from the bus stop on mcloughlin blvd. just south of milwaukie heading west through the neighborhood. we rounded a corner under a dense tree and happened to look up in the sky directly to the west. it was an extremely clear night; i had my \"good\" eyeglasses on and my son's vision was 20\\10. we both saw a bright sphere high up, maybe 20,000 ft being chased by what appeared to be a us fighter jet. the sphere appeared to be in width the same size as the nose of the jet. the sphere was moving erratically, making sharp turns (tighter that 90 degrees) and what appeared to be a laser shot out of the nose of the jet at it; the sphere was easily dodging the laser, which angled out from the jet from directly forward to a 90 degree angle. i have since seen on tv that the air force has perfected a laser weapon that can rotate on the nose of a fighter jet exactly like the one we saw that night. it appeared to both of us not to be some kind of military exercise, but it looked like the jet was definitely after the sphere. we eventually lost sight, i believe the jet and whatever the other thing was flew too far away or too high up for us to see anymore."],"Summary":"fighter jet chased erratically moving sphere high up over western Oregon","Log Number":"US-07032008-0018","Case Number":"11409","trends":["There have been no other sightings in between Cannon Beach and","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Circle","City":"between Cannon Beach and","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-120.549781","Latitude":"43.812973","Date Submitted":"10/15/2001 11:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11409.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11409.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/15/2001 11:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.812973,+-120.549781(11409)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11409) map </A>"}
