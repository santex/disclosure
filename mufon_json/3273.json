It seems that for the last three years- especially this year- that no matter how many times I reset my clocks and watches- the next day or so- the times aren t in synch any more. At first I thought it was bad batteries in my watch or alarm clock but then my husband s electric alarm clock was off too. It is not just the colcks in our house but in my car as well. I am always resetting it or resetting my watch to match my car- or something of the sorts. Is there a natural phenom as to why our \"time\" keeps getting fragged? Is there something magnetic in the ground that would cause this? Or am I just paranoid because I am begginning to never know what time it really is?! My husband thinks I am crazy for researching this and trying to find answers. He thinks I am just over tired from working and balancing time with our infant son. This \"missing time\" started before I was pregnant- and got more noticable recently. Maybe he is right and I am just being over-reactive. I would still like a second opinion."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"3273","Log Number":"","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"03/10/2005 03:26 UTC","Latitude":"26.162504","Date of the Event":"03/10/2005 03:26 UTC"}
