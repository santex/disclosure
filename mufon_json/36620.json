Looking out the living room window my sister said here comes a ufo as we looked north and she was just kidding. As we watched the object get closer we went outside and noticed not a sound like you would here from a airplane. As it went over head it made a whirring sound. It was triangle shaped with three lights. My son states he was excited. My daughter will not talk about it. Lost sight of this object as it kept going south and trees got in the way."]}
