When I got home I got my old,4 mega pixel camera and when out on my porch to video it and take pics. For some reason the vid part refused to work so I took consecutive pictures and got it changing color and powering up as shown.I had just charged the battery to my camera just 2 days before but, the cameras battery died as I was getting some good shots and had to plug in the battery charger and wait until morning to see what I got.I was very excited and could not get to sleep.I have seen this type of orb several times before but it was usually gone when I got my camera."],"Region":"New Hampshire","Longitude":"-71.937669","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-11172012-0011","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Antrim","There were no other sightings in Antrim on or around November 17th 2012"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.034576,+-71.937669(43973)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43973) map </A>","Latitude":"43.034576","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"It was changing colors and powering up Blue thenpowering down red a few times.","Date of the Event":"11/17/2012 11:45 UTC","City":"Antrim","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43973.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43973.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/17/2012 10:48 UTC","Case Number":"43973"}
