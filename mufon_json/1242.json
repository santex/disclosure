{"Summary":"U.F.O. Seen Flying Around Nellis Air Force Base U","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"Nevada","Latitude":"36.118946","Longitude":"-115.171296","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","City":"Las Vegas","Weather Factors":"Windy","divs":["Sighting Details We were at the Nellis Air Force Base lookingfor U.F.O.s. We had read that the Nellis area was an area where U.F.O.s couldbe found with the correct equipment. We brought with us a very sensitiveinfra-red system. When the system was turned on we immediately picked up thesignature for the U.F.O.At first we thought the object may have been a planeflying through the Nellis airspace. The object did not fly in a straight lineas other planes do. The craftzig zagged and kept flying in strange patterns theentire evening. When we returned the next evening the object could still befound over the Air Force Base!There is something out of the ordinary flyingabove Nellis and should be investigated. Whether or not it is the actual Alienship needs to be determined byprofessional researchers. If you can get out hereto take a look at what we have found I think it would make a good report. Itappears the craft is not leaving the Nellis Area and neither are we.
