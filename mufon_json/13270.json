It was night time in Dallas, TX. About 9:00 pm. Summertime. Me and my brother and sister were playing in the park while my dad and uncle played tennis. I went off alone and I saw in the sky, an object that appeared to be flying or moving very slowly going at an angle down. The object was white. Like a bright light. One round 2 dimensional bright white ball on side and the same on the other. And in between them about as far apart of about two house-lengths was a bright light bar holding the balls together. The balls were like the size of a house. I was at a park. I didn't know what to do, or who to tell. I was scared of UFO's ever since. Then I heard about MUFON on the discovery channel. But I do know that I never, ever have heard or seen anyone describe this thing. It was really flat looking, very bright, quiet, and looked like it was going to land, but it disappeared. I tried to get my dad to look, but he was busy playing tennis. Has anyone ever described something like this?"]}
