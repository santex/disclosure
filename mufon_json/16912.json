(satellites are normally hard to see at my location because of light pollution.) no sooner did i thought \"cool, there's a satellite\", i saw another trailing it. as soon as the first one went out of sight, another one appeared in nearly the same trajectory. then it happened again and again for about 6 or 7 times. i thought, \"whoa, this is weird\". i called a friend (that's when i looked at the time) and told him what i saw, but i didn't see anything after that event. it's hard to describe the separation distance between the objects, but for comparison sake i would estimate it to be about the distance of the bucket opening of the big dipper i know that this isn't the way satellites are supposed to orbit, but i don't know what else the objects could be. the speed of the objects were going at the customarily speed of satellites i'm used to seeing. i didn't think they could be shooting stars because they weren't the right light intensity, speed, and they didn't leave a tail. there was no blinking lights, and they appeared to be quite high in the sky, so i don't think they could have been planes. after describing my story to a few friends, i was informed of some other ufo events in our area. i read about them, but what those stories desribed is not what i saw. i was hoping someone had a similar sighting. sorry, no photos. i don't know if that was even possible unless i had high quality equipment."],"Date Submitted":"05/11/2009 10:05 UTC","Region":"Missouri","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Arnold","There were no other sightings in Arnold on or around May 11th 2009"],"Longitude":"-90.377619","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.432832,+-90.377619(16912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16912) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"16912","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","City":"Arnold","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/11/2009 10:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-05132009-0010"}
