{"Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and a fellow marine were standing post around 2 am when we were looking up and had seen 4 orange lights in a trapezoid shape or formation fly over...we work around military aircraft its nothing we have seen and pretty much all aircraft in that area you will hear but this was silent and the shape stayed the same no staggering like normal military aircraft. The lights were low enough for it to make noise but it was dead silent. The object flew over fast and disappeared over the mountains."],"Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-116.543922","Latitude":"33.838656","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24554","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Palm Springs","There were no other sightings in Palm Springs on or around May 9th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.838656,+-116.543922(24554)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24554) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/16/2010 09:57 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24554.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24554.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07162010-0006","Date of the Event":"05/09/2010 02:00 UTC","City":"Palm Springs","Summary":"Fast, trapazoid, silent."}
