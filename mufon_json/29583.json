I noticed a yellow-orange glow coming from a wooded hilltop on the other side of the lake. At first, I thought it was headlights, but then as I was watching, I realized it was the wrong color for headlights. It was a slow pulsing from dim to bright, then back to dim. It wasn't behaving like a fire or any light source that I know of. I watched it for about an hour. I was very curious, but I wasn't sure how to get over there to see it more closely. It was still going on when I left."],"Summary":"Yellow orange glow coming from hill.
