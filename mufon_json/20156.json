Well went and fed the Horses and barn cats and when I came out the star seemed brighter so I watched it fro a second now thinking it was a low flying aircraft, well as it got closer it took shape it was a bright yellow triangle and it was moving extremely fast and as it passed over it was really big talking 50 to 70 yards front to back and 70 to 100 yards wide. I wanted to run grab my camera but I feared it would be gone by time i got in and out of the house.
