North Phoenix, AZ. Most intense lightening displayin Phoenix in 20-30 years according to the next days newscaster. Have videotape of two men in a luxury apartment pool, during intense lightening storm,dissapear in the center of pool when lights go out and come back on. A shorttime later the lights go out and come on and they return. The only crack ofthunder hit at that moment and both men exited the pool and left. A few thingshappen after this that are pretty interesting. Also, this whole time there is aCD playing of my favorite band, TOOL. The song plays for about 45 minutesskipping in unison to the lightening strikes and getting stuck on, learn toswim, see you down in AZ. bay. It is quite an amazing tape. After theexperience all I could think about was when B. Franklin flew a kite with a keyattached during a lightening storm. There is much more to this but I will keepit short for now.Thanks......"],"Log Number":"","City":"Glendale","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Summanus.....","Latitude":"33.545652","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2865.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2865.html"],"Region":"Arizona","Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.545652,+-112.178087(2865)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2865) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-112.178087","Case Number":"2865"}
