It was the shape of a \"<\" from my east, moving north to south. For a second, I thought it was a flight of aircraft flying in formation, but the lights stayed in the same exact positions the whole time, plus, If they were jets flying in a blue angels style formation, I would have heard it. Once the object got to the southeast of me, i no longer could see it. I don't know if the lights turned off or it faded away in the haze, but I no longer could see it. There was a strong smell of sulphur I noticed right before and now, I don't smell it at all."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Venice","There were no other sightings in Venice on or around October 10th 2012"],"City":"Venice"}
