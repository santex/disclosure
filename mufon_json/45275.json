There were three extremely bright white lights at each corner which strobed simultaneously and lit up the tree tops. the vehicle was no more than 30 feet above the trees (roughly 100 feet above my head) and made no sound at all. I watched as it slowly drifted in a southerly direction for roughly two minutes as it could clearly be seen due to the extreme brightness of the lights. It seemed to stay just above the trees as it drifted away. It did not move quickly or make any sudden movements. I lost sight of it due to there being too many trees in my view. I can not say it was a spaceship or a government drone test or any type of flying craft i have ever seen and i am left with nothing but questions. What i do know is that i will never leave my home without a camera again, even to just take out the trash."]}
