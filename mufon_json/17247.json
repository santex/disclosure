i was really wishing i���d had my camera for this because i love to do photography and videos and it figures the 1 time i get to see something ufo-like i didn���t have it with me. never in my life did i expect to see color-changing orbs in the sky seeming to give birth to another set of lights! this triangular-shaped set of 3 lights were all the same distance apart from each other and moved together like affixed to a craft, one amber steady (non-blinking) light at each point, however it was too dark to see what this craft looked liked. to me it was like seeing lights on an airplane at night, except airplanes don���t hover in 1 spot and rotate mid-air in that spot like this thing did. so after the triangular light thing came out of the blinking light i noticed it���s lights did not change color and were not blinking at all, and were a steady amber. it appeared to come out of the blinking light almost backwards from what i could tell, and hovered in the same spot facing the blinking orb-light like a child looking at its mother. it was the weirdest thing i���d ever seen. they seemed to move like they had a mind of their own or were conscious or something. i don���t know how else to describe it. i���ve heard of people thinking they���ve seen ufos and such, but having never seen one myself, i would need hard evidence to believe any story like this from someone. especially if it were this out of the ordinary, so this notion of being skeptical and even second guessing yourself if witnessing 1st hand, i can understand completely. but if the evidence was there, i am not above admitting that these things may be possible. after the 3 light triangular thingy was in the sky for minute facing it���s mama blinking orb (which was on the right of the 3 light triangular thing), it rotated in mid air turning from right to left and so was facing away from me as it turned. i was still at my front door and my dog was barking at something but i was too busy watching these lights to notice what she was barking at, because she barks at everything! the rotation was a full ��� turn to face my left but still in same spot next to the blinking light which was still blinking and changing colors exactly the same as it had been. after the 3 light triangular thing was facing left and away from the blinking orb-light it left, but seemed to go much faster than the normal planes do and at closer range would have most definitely appeared totally hyper speed. it was gone in a few seconds but it didn���t just disappear in a flash, it gradually left my view toward the left and behind some trees obscuring my view. now the blinking light was still there just blinking away and changing color and was truly mesmerizing, but was it me or was this thing getting smaller and smaller and harder to see? yes it was. this was sooo weird! it was either moving further away or shrinking and now the color changing though i could tell it was still changing, was a bit harder to notice. about then, my neighbors pulled up, a nice couple next door, and parked in their normal spot and began walking to their door. they would pass me on the sidewalk and while i was starring up and my dog was still throwing a fit, but now over the approaching neighbors, i was trying to figure out how to ask them if they too had seen, or could see the light so as to not appear weird like a total freak. i reigned my dog in on her leash, and briefly scolded her for barking at the nice neighbors, and reminded her that it was the ���share area,��� as she had been used to having her own yard and now had to share a courtyard with other pesky people and dogs. as the neighbors passed me i asked ���do you guys see that light up there?��� they looked up and saw it immediately as this was the only light now in the sky and even stars were not out and it was still quite a bit bigger than any stars. it was still there just blinking away. i said ���yeah, it���s been there for a couple minutes now and changing all sorts of pretty colors. i���ve never seen anything like it.��� the light appeared to be smaller now, and had already gotten much smaller by the time the neighbors looked up. ���hmm.��� they said and starred for approx 15-20 secs, maybe a bit less. ���cool.��� and after the brief exchange they went inside, and i was kind of amazed they didn���t seem to care more. but it was late, and i���m sure they were tired, and as we live by an airport they may have totally just thought it thought it was another plane at night that was especially pretty as i didn���t mention the words ���do you think this is a ufo?��� to them, and except for the fact it was blinking and only had 1 color changing light, and was totally silent. then i realized it had indeed been totally silent this whole time and there was no normal ear-deafening jet noise, not even off in the distance. from where the light was it appeared to be fairly close to the flight path of planes as they take off or land, but a bit higher, but way too low, large and color-changing to be a star, planet, or other astronomical phenomenon. usually those planes in the take-off\\landing path we can hear. also of note is that the direction the 3 light triangular thingy took off in was not consistent with the normal flight path we are used to. being much further to the left and though hard to describe, out towards another direction and went behind some trees eventually out of view. but the simple fact that it could hover was not consistent with any planes we know of! planes appear to move steady and the higher they are the slower they seem to go. so this 3 light thing would have been moving very fast for where it was in the sky. so now the blinking light was getting smaller it seemed with every several blinks. this is where it gets tricky to explain. if it were moving away it would have literally jumped a great distance, like teleporting, every time it blinked off, appearing again in another spot just a bit above and away from where it had previously been. as i began to ponder this i thought, it looks like about a centimeter to me if i held a ruler to the sky (and this is approx as i didn���t have a ruler and i would be cautious in my estimation bordering on just less than a cm rather than over a cm with each blink). but it didn���t move on every blink, just periodically every few seconds, and just continued blinking and changing color the whole time. those 2 things about it never stopped. finally after a couple more min (= about 4 minutes total but i could be a bit under and it may have been longer than 4 min) it was almost too small to detect at all, and i���m sure it was much further away, unless it was getting smaller in size. since it was dark i cannot be sure of which but our eyes and minds assume getting smaller equals further away. other than my neighbors briefly walking by, i noticed no other people who may have seen the whole thing as it was late so most were probably in bed. i hope someone else in town saw this too, as i can���t be the only nutty-sounding person tonight who saw this. i would like to remain anonymous, because i don���t want anyone to think i���m crazy for what i know i witnessed tonight. however, i wouldn���t mind if anyone at mufon had any questions about this event and they should know how to contact me. if anyone else in my area saw this, please speak up and report it, so i don���t look like a fool. normally i���d blow off something odd in my day, but this was just too odd to not do anything about, and if it can be helpful to anyone studying ufos or unknown things in the sky scientifically, then i offer my story for that purpose. i know i���m not nuts and even questioned myself as this was happening, like we as human are accustomed to doing in a bizarre event. but every time i blinked, it was still there and i know my neighbors saw a small piece of it toward the end, even though by then it was so small and easy to pass off as something coming from our local airport. this was not a plane! i didn���t see any aliens or anything like that and i wasn���t abducted, it was just a random sighting that was a bit too close for comfort, and too real to pass of as nothing. i pride myself on trying to be an honest person, and have no investments one way or another, nor any reason to put myself out there to share this story. i am a very private person, and am not one trying to be famous or wanting my picture everywhere. i like my privacy, but i would be willing to answer any questions by the people who are investigating these things running this site. i didn���t get any pics and will make some sketches as soon as i���m done reporting this and will hang onto them, but i���m not uploading those sketches here as i don���t have the means to because like i said, i value my privacy and i���m no artist. i am much better with words than a sketch pad, so i hope this helps, and many blessings to those who spent countless hours investigating this stuff. everything is as accurate and detailed as i can be. i will continue to make notes and do some digging to see if anyone else in town saw this oddity. i don���t know if it was just some government craft we���ve never heard of but i sure as heck couldn���t identify what these lights were, and that makes them ���unidentified��� in my normal, sane mind. i debated reporting this, but my hope is that it is helpful to the study. my head is just spinning trying to process this whole thing, so i���m glad that���s all i witnessed, but i guess i have a story for my grandkids, because i don���t think i can tell most people about this or they���ll think its nuts. its nuts to me and i was there."],"Summary":"Outside front door,saw blinking light changing colors& a 3 lighted triangularshapecraft seemed come out of blinking light,hover briefly,rotating 1/2 turn & sped off.Light stayed 2 more min after, hovering & left inoddwayinveryfastspurts/blinks!otherssaw.","Case Number":"17247","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Troutdale","There were no other sightings in Troutdale on or around May 29th 2009"],"Region":"Oregon","Log Number":"US-05302009-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.539286,+-122.387313(17247)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17247) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/29/2009 10:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle, Other, Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17247.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17247.html"]}
