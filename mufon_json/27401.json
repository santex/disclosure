I noticed this object seemed to have a tail at the end of it, the whole thing began moving upward then back down several times and moved like a caterpillar or a jellyfish. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, I quickly called my boyfriend and described the object and asked him to try to look for it where he was at, but he was unable to see what I was seeing from his location, as I continued to watch this object in the sky for about 10 minutes it started looking more like just a star, what looked to be stationary so I hung up my phone and began taking pictures. I snapped 15 photos on my Samsung Behold II, 5 mega pixel camera back to back, I left my finger pressed and did not release it, I had my elbows resting on the dashboard so that I wouldn���t move the phone. In all the photos the object is clearly in another position in the sky and moving up and down as if it was jumping around. I would have taken more photos however my phone had a very low battery and it shut off. I stayed staring at the object for and additional 10 minutes after the photos where taken then decided to go inside to charge my phone, I hesitated to exit my vehicle because I was a little frightened however, I was excited that I was able to capture it on my camera phone. I went inside and charged my phone about five minutes, in attempts to get video of it, but when I came back outside it was no where to be found. After watching this object in the sky for about 20 minutes I can definetly say that it was an Unidentified Flying Object... I just want to know if anyone else in the Fort Worth area seen anything similar to what I just described in the early morning of the 13th of January. I zoomed in and cropped all the pictures that i had taken of the object and made this slide. The pictures were all taken within 2 min. of each other. The object is clearly changing shapes, but you decide."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Fort Worth","Case Number":"27401","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27401.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27401_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27401.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:25:00","Summary":"Orange/red star-like glowing object changing shapes","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like"}
