It was halloween and I was trick or treating with my friends in Williamsburg. We noticed a glowing orange light in the sky and stopped to watch. It was soon joined by 2 or 3 others. They then proceeded to drop this glowing orange substance, which trickled down and looked sort of like a flare. We watched them do this for a few minutes, and I'm not sure what happened afterwards. We either just walked away after a while, or they disappeared and then we walked away. I thought they might have been those lanterns that people light off on the 4th of July, but I don't know why someone would have been doing that on Halloween. Also the objects' behavior indicated otherwise, as they appeared out of nowhere and hovered in place."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lincoln","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Nebraska","Latitude":"40.808472","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Lincoln","There were no other sightings in Lincoln on or around October 31st 2008"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.808472,+-96.676879(48838)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48838) map </A>","Longitude":"-96.676879"}
