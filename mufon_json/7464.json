{"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"North Carolina","Date of the Event":"07/12/2007 09:55 UTC","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing outside at my home talking on the phone to a friend describing a previous sighting when I saw a bright orange light hovering about 35 to 40 degrees off the ground. I didn't know what it was, I knew it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or street light. It was to high to be street light, there was no sound or blinking lights. It just hovered with no sound. I was curious about it and kind of excited that I had seen two UFOs in one night. I lost sight of it when i went inside to eat before my food got cold. The weather was clear. The object didn't move, make sounds, or have any blinking lights. When I went outside an hour later it was gone."],"Log Number":"US-07162007-0010","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"35.385147","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","City":"Benson","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"07/12/2007 09:55 UTC","Longitude":"-78.541841","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7464.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7464.html"],"Case Number":"7464","Summary":"A bright orange light.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.385147,+-78.541841(7464)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7464) map </A>","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Benson","There was one other sighting in Benson on or around July 12th 2007"]}
