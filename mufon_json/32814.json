I watched it sitting in my front yard. My mom couldn't see it, but it was really easy to miss. While watching, I noticed that the object was indeed moving slightly southwest because it was moving away from me and to the left. It eventually disappeared after blinking in and out of sight, which could have been happening because it was so far away. I have seen lots of strange craft in Fresno, at least 5 during my years here."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/23/2011 10:09 UTC","Log Number":"US-10232011-0025","Latitude":"36.849325","Case Number":"32814","Date of the Event":"10/23/2011 06:00 UTC"}
