It���s very rural out here so there is typically great sky visibility at night. Last night, May 31st, 2008, my dog was a little restless and barking in the back yard so, I got up to check on him. It was about 11:30 PM. It was a really clear and peaceful night so, I decided to pull up my lounge chair and star watch for a bit. No sooner had I sat down and leaned back when I spotted three white, star-like lights moving east to west across the sky in a fixed triangle formation. It was an uneven triangle with the two longer, equal sides leading. The lights were solid and did not blink or twinkle. They moved in a straight and unwavering path at a fixed speed comparable to the speed of typical air traffic. The altitude was at least 30,000 ft or more, maybe higher than most of the commercial planes that have a path in this area. Distance-wise, this is all just a rough estimate but, to the eye, the lights appeared to be an inch or so from each other. I cannot say for certain if the lights were separate objects or corners of one singular craft as I couldn���t make out any other details. Also, I know it may have helped but, in the moment I didn���t notice if other stars behind it were being obscured or not when it passed. I watched this formation cross the sky for over a minute or so until it was finally out of sight. Anyway, I really don���t think this was 3 satellites moving in unison. I don���t think this was 3 planes or military jets moving in unison as you can generally always see flashing lights & hear them. All was silent before, during and after this thing passed. With all said, it was pretty amazing to see something like this even though it was a pretty tame sighting compared to many others with erratic behavior and whatnot. If it were in fact one of the often reported ���black triangles��� then, this thing had to be huge based on the size it appeared to be at that distance. Keep your eyes on the skies people! Oh, and pay close attention to your pets. They may be trying to tell you that the mothership is in the 'hood. \"Bow Wow Wow Yippy Yo Yippy Yah! - George Clinton"],"Longitude":"-98.09862","Latitude":"29.997436","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"triangle formation passes over my neighborhood","Log Number":"US-06012008-0011","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/31/2008 11:30 UTC","Tags":"City"}
