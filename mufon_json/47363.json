They were going higher and farther away. They were dim and seemed to flicker at the distance I guessed to be 5 miles away. Some of them floated close to each other and then there appeared to be only one. I looked around some trees blocking my view and observed 4 or 5 more taking off in 1 second intervals from the ground at a 45 degree angle in the direction of the other ones. The event was happening over near the chandler airport."],"Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47363.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47363.html"],"Longitude":"-111.83327","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"47363"}
