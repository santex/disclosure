Facing north sitting in my truck caught something out of the corner of my eye toward the northwest looked up it was hard to describe something between a square and a rectangle with unknown apparatus (wings, antenna?) dull brown or rust in color with what appeared to be a hole offset in the corner. Thought it was cardboard in wind but it stayed stationary and rotated slow. A 737 flew under it it did not take evasive manuevers from that view it appeared the same size as the plane but hard to judge scale. Might have been possibly very high in atmosphere if so it would be huge. watched for maybe 2 minutes then it faded from site."],"Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18142.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18142.html"],"Latitude":"39.744024","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/17/2009 09:00 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-104.975503","Case Number":"18142","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There was one other sighting in Denver on or around June 17th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07172009-0014","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Wings, Other, Unknown","Summary":"Square closest description like nazca lines","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.744024,+-104.975503(18142)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18142) map </A>"}
