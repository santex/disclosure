{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was eating dinner with some friends,someone pointed them out. When I saw them I automatically thought of the videos Ive seen online of the same thing in other places. The objects came into sight from behind some trees that were blocking our view. The moved across the sky some what randomly all at the same speed. Slowly they flickered out one by one until there was 3 left. The three were arranged in a isosceles triangle,with the short side parallel with the ground.About a minute later, starting with the top light they slowly went out. The location was east of where I was. I assume it was over Lake Osceola. It could have been flares from a plane. Although I have no idea what that looks like."],"Country":"United States","City":"Winter Park","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-81.378261","Date of the Event":"01/21/2012 09:15 UTC","Case Number":"35046","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/22/2012 01:33 UTC","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Winter Park","There were no other sightings in Winter Park on or around January 21st 2012"],"Object Shape":"Circle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35046.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35046.html"],"Log Number":"US-01222012-0001","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"28.578329","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.578329,+-81.378261(35046)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35046) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"A group of yellowish lights move across the sky."}
