{"Case Number":"19448","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was talking with my neighbor in his driveway about 7:45pm and his pet goose was really honking like crazy which is unusual for him at almost 8pm. we gave him some food to shut him up (which it didn't) when I saw the light in the sky. We both witnessed it very clearly. It looked like a spotlight shining down through the clouds but it was a crisp clear sky. The light was bright and cone shaped with the wide part facing down and what appeared to be fog in the light, like a high-beam headlight. No object was seen just the white light, no blinking colors and no sound. Then it just disappeared after about a minute, maybe less. The goose relaxed when the light went out. The goats and other animals didn't seem to notice it."],"Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 10:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Bolivar","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"42.066733","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bolivar","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Cone","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19448.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19448.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 07:50 UTC","Longitude":"-78.167788","Summary":"cone shaped bright foggy light in SE sky, goose was affected","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.066733,+-78.167788(19448)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19448) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09192009-0065"}
