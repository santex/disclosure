My husband and i walked out and were only out for a minute and then we saw them...i guess that was a lucky thing.I didnt have to wonder what it was since these lights have been seen here off and on for quite a while now...guess they like the dairies around this area of texas.The rather round orange lights (that look almost all the same size)just last a few seconds then they disappear.Of course your real excited when we are seeing these lights..and then they are gone (maybe not really gone, just change position so we can no longer see them)..almost always afterwards we see the blinking of jets and hear the jets coming in the area.Since we had had some news only a couple of weeks ago about the unexplained lights again in the stephenville paper people in this area start looking around at night again to see UFOs.Actually we had seen the lights last october and were waiting for this october to look again ..but it was cloudy most of the month.Now it is november and we saw them last night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20616.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20616.html"],"Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-98.024725","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/19/2009 09:39 UTC","Log Number":"US-11192009-0018","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"20616","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Hico","There were no other sightings in Hico on or around November 18th 2009"],"Summary":"the objects or lights were orange in color and probably 7 in all in a row","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Hico","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"31.986115"}
