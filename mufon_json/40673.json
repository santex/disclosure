{"Latitude":"38.925435","divs":["sighting detailssometimes i see ufos in the general kc area anyway. but this one happened roughly between 3 in the morning till about 6:30 to 6:45. and these were very clear to the naked eye! somewhat orb-like in nature and sometimes i saw a very clear triangle shape in some of my photos. [at least 3 to 4, and probably as much as 6 to 7 total!] i took some pictures of these things, and i was just in mere awe of looking at these things for well over 3 hours time. it was rather entrancing and even thrilled to see them much closer then i had ever expected! out of about 300 pictures, there was about 4 or 5 that i just could not really explain! another person i know, also had claimed to see these unusual lights\\crafts during about 4 in the morning, when he was going to kci airport. [so roughly about 3 to even 4 hours, these crafts were descending in the air. i want to say, roughly 500 to 4000 feet in the air and ascending upward and at a slight tilting angle.] i saw them towards the direction of blue springs even though i live in the lee's summit area. they were very low in hovering position till they slowly creeped upward. the lowest one was extremely bright! my pictures probably don't do it too much justice, but i clearly know what i saw! i saw 2 major crafts in the sky at all times. both were pulsating like a red\\blue\\green\\white\\purple\\greyish, the lower one was brighter then the other one. [stacked one on top of another, in a sort of zeta reticuli constellation fashion.] these 2 major crafts had what i would describe as ���scout ships��� beside them. [much smaller ships by these bigger ships. the lower one you could clearly see a smaller ship, but they were in a pretty tight formation. adjacent to the bigger ships that resembled fireballs.] i was also seeing other smaller scout ships fly outward from and towards it, but sometimes they would get closer to the big spaceships. i had to sometimes cross the street just to see them closer-up. but gosh, it was worth it! i even seen a black helicopter before these spaceships started rising up during the beginnings of my ufo watch! i could hear it more then anything, but i could see it a bit. but i saw these things both at the end of night and in the beginnings of daybreak! [when the sun started to come out.] they were still glowing intensely bright. no planes ever glow that bright for a constant amount of time, especially hovering for prolonged periods of time like these did. and i know this was not a north star or some airplane either. this was rather clearly something extraterrestrial in nature. as much as they were just sort of hanging out, probably to charge up their ships until they could make a leap back to their planet[s]! wild stuff! [i know i was not the only one to see these things.]"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40673.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40673.html"],"Log Number":"US-07102012-0024","Case Number":"40673","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"4 to 6 UFOs in the KC Area!
