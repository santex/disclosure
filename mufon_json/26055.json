It was a perfectly clear night, and in front of me and a friend I saw a bright green light in the sky. At first it looked like a fire work, or a flare floating in the air. Before I had time to decide what it looked like, it stopped briefly, and flew straight away from us, heading almost due north. As it was flying away I could make out a circular shape, with four distinct green lights in a circle. It happened so fast that I wasn't sure what I saw at first, and we just stood there looking at each other dumb founded."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-87.659536","Date Submitted":"10/23/2010 03:42 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"I saw a green light fall from the sky like a flare, then stop and fly away from me to the north.","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.491307","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Disc","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26055.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26055.html"],"Case Number":"26055"}
