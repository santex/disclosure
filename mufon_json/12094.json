Examining the picture later I noticed what seems to be two contrails of objects moving from right to left. One (the lower) seems to be generated by a disc-shaped cloud. The other seems to be generated by something in the clouds that has a row of lights. I took this photo myself with a new digital camara and it has not been altered in any way. I insist on exclusive ownership of this photo and it cannot be reproduced without my permission. The more I look at it the harder it is for me to think that it is a natural phenomena."],"Summary":"Attached picture seems to show two disc shaped objects with contrails","Object Features":"Window(s)","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"09/30/2006 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-08162008-0007","Date Submitted":"09/30/2006 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12094.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12094_submitter_file1__Houmahelos003.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12094.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Louisiana","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"29.5989","Case Number":"12094"}
