I was the only vehicle visible in the area when a bright white light filled the cab of my pickup. The next thing I was aware of was a very bright,focused column of light in my rear view mirror that almost immediately went out. I was also aware that there was a set of tail lights several hundreds of yards ahead of me that were not there the moment before. I have told this to a view friends and was dismissed as being full of it. I had no ill feelings at the time nor any time since. I only wish to know what happened. I do not believe that we are not alone, I know it for a fact! I have had other unexplainable sightings in my life but never one so close, so apparently intimate. There is nothing I can add to this, I just want someone who won't think I am nuts to know."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Coal Valley","There were no other sightings in Coal Valley on or around November 6th 2006"],"Date of the Event":"11/06/2006 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois","Log Number":"US-12212009-0011","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/21/2009 09:27 UTC","Summary":"Drove into and out of light column with apparent time loss.","Case Number":"21083","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.428646,+-90.460965(21083)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21083) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21083.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21083.html"]}
