(they said they wanted to make sure they weren't going crazy) as we got halfway through town, we saw the lights again off to the nw towards abilene. this time mom got a better view because they were lower, at about a 30 deg. angle. it started out as what looked like one big light and then all of a sudden, as i said \"hey look!\", it just split off into about 7-10 slightly smaller ones that were aligned in a perfectly horizontal row and evenly spaced apart. a few seconds later, they just vanished again like a light being turned off and that's the last time we saw them. i mean i have seen lights in the sky before, but that was the craziest thing i've ever seen. if i wouldn't have been driving, i would have tried to capture the images with my iphone."],"Log Number":"US-02112011-0012"}
