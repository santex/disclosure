Angel Fire is in a valley at an elevation of 8,400 ft surrounded by mountains of roughly 10,000 ft to the east and 13,300 feet to the west. Just before 9 pm on August 26 I heard and felt a window-rattling noise, which caused me to go outside to investigate. Once outside, I looked up and saw a large helicopter (with bright exterior lights and dim interior lights, noise, spinning rotors) traveling slowly in a northward direction a few hundred feet above Hwy 64. Immediately in front of the helicopter was an object approximately four times as long as the helicopter. The object was bullet-shaped on both ends and cylindrical between the bullet-shaped ends. The object had no lights, no wings, no markings or windows that I could see, and made no sound. It blocked out the stars behind it. I was able to discern its shape by the shape of the area of blocked-out stars and by the moonlight which illuminated its underside. The night was clear, with no clouds and easily-distinguishable stars. The moon (just a couple of days past full) was rising over the mountains to the east at the time I saw the object. It appeared to me that the object was being \"escorted\" by the helicopter behind it. Both the helicopter and the object moved at a steady, but slow, pace. The unknown object traveled steadily with no wobble or other movement. I watched the helicopter and the unknown object for about three minutes until they disappeared over the horizon. (The helicopter lights were visible for about three minutes ��� the object in front of the helicopter became unseeable after about a minute and a half.) My feelings? Incredulity! Curiosity! Why was a large UFO flying so low and why was a large helicopter 'assisting' it?"],"Summary":"Large craft with no lights, no wings, no sound \"escorted by large helicopter","Longitude":"-105.279419","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Angel Fire","There were no other sightings in Angel Fire on or around August 26th 2010"],"Region":"New Mexico","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-10042010-0009","Latitude":"36.395638","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None"}
