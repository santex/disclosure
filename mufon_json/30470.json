The original soung of a high flying plane(we believe it was a A.W.A.X. early warning aircraft) was there all the time but now we could see its lights very high in the sky and this follwed the same path and turned at the same point following. Nothing has ever happened to us like this before we have seen police helicopters over us and know how they behave at nite but nothing like this."],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
