When they were closing I was on my way home walking. When I got to a fence opening near an apartment complex I looked up behind me. I saw a small dot of light way up in the sky. I turned around, and watched it. It came down pretty fast, as it turned out to be somekind of aircraft resembling an airplane. It's back wings and body looked like an airplane, but its large side wings were angled back with five or six semi-circles on the backs of them. This aircraft came down fast, and did a nose-dive in the middle of the main street (Chapman Ave.). It did not create a sonic boom. It went straight up at a slight angle, and disappeared into outer space at a high speed. Thank you."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9771.html"],"Log Number":"US-02282008-0031","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Garden Grove","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"9771","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.778875,+-117.940438(9771)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9771) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Garden Grove","There were no other sightings in Garden Grove on or around November 30th 1987"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.940438","Summary":"A dot of light came down and did a nose dive being somekind of aircraft."}
