It was a bright and clear night with a full moon (or very close to it),and some clouds. My daughter looking up to admire the clouds in the light saw a satellite and pointed. Then, I looked up as well and then she exclaimed \"WHOA! There are a whole bunch of them!\" We started counting as they passed over, and in my range of site, I counted 12 in very close proximity. They were all moving at the same speed and were at somewhat staggared distances apart from each other.
