It was not something I had heard before, so I made my way to the window to see what the heck it was. As I did, a bright, very fast moving light came from the SW heading towards the NE. It was much faster then any plane or helicopter and was not a shooting star or meteor. It then came to a complete stop for about 10 seconds and I get the best look at it. It was cigar shaped, with one signal strobing light that overtook the whole craft. When it stopped so did the noise and everything was just silent. It then took off again, and the noise came roaring back. However when it tokk off, it did not go in a straight line, it did almost a half moon arch down even lower to the ground and then went straight away. We all have seen planes and the like at night and this was without a doubt not one. It was far to fast and like I said it stopped \"on a dime\", and then the angle it took down after that was way to insane to be a plane of some sort. This location is right in my backyard in Glenside, about 10 minutes from the Willow Grove Mall. Oh, and after whatever it was took off, every bird on the block(who should have all been sleeping), started going crazy and did not stop for at least half an hour."],"Log Number":"US-06242009-0005","Summary":"A loud, wharbling, whistling sound followed by a fast, bright strobing light.","Date Submitted":"06/23/2009 09:48 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17640.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17640.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cone","Case Number":"17640","City":"Glenside","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.102332,+-75.15212(17640)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17640) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/23/2009 09:48 UTC","Longitude":"-75.15212","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
