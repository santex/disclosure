They were moving north in my direction. I watched for a few seconds and realized that none of them were blinking. They appeared to just glow a bright red. I caught my dad's attention and asked him to look. The only thing we could hear were other airplanes crossing their paths. Airplanes were distinctly different in that they could be heard, even at greater distances, while also running with the proper flashing navigation lights. The red orbs however were all coming from the south and heading north following the exact same path--one after another. I watched for ten minutes and counted over ten within that time span. One group of two were tailing each other at a close distance--approximately 500-1000 ft. Oddly, every single one of them just vanished the moment they reached the point perpendicular to my position. I could see the stars in the sky; the night was clear."]}
