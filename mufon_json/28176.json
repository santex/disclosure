In July, 1964, two teenagers sprawled in grass in yard saw disk move to 50-75 feet above house, and shine a VERY bright white light on them. Reporting witness found himself staring into SOLID-BLACK eyes, which he wanted to think were his buddy's eyes. When he looked at grass it had tinselly look. In other words, things looked weird, not natural. When next he became aware, both he and his buddy were now STANDING, NOT SPRAWLED, at a different location in the yard. They did not check the time when the incident was over. Both witnesses found themselves very SILENT about this case for a number of years.
