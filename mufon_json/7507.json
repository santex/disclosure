Something caught my eye. I looked up and this spacecraft came in so fast it left a trail. It stopped immediately. I watched it for maybe 30 seconds, then it took off so fast it left another trail. It left in an arch. I have never called it a UFO, it was definitely a Spacecraft. There were lights on the craft, but I do not remember what color they were."]}
