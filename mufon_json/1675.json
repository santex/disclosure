It was a late summer-time dusk. We bothobserved a three pointed craft, moving from south to north at a steady speed andwithout sound. Our first thought was that it was a conventional aircraft. However, there were NO blinking lights, such as one would expect on an aircraft,and NO engine sound whatsoever. There was one steady white light at each cornerof the craft, and a black triangle-shaped expanse in between. As the craftpassed under a star, the stars light was blocked out. The craft disappearedfrom view on the northern horizon. We went home and reported this sighting toour parents. Both of us remember this event to this day, as do our parents."],"Summary":"Black Triangles Seen in Fulton Co.","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
