I stop at starbucks to get my regular coffee. I took eastbound kettleman rd. to alpine exit. I turn right on alpine going southbound when I notice a bright red and green light low in altitude. the light where not blinking. As I got closing the light where not moving but stationary. I slow down as I got closier to the lights. When I was right above the ufo It look triangle in shape. I would guess it was less then 1ooo ft. above the ground. as soon as I stop it disappear. I know my aircrafts well. I know most planes have white lights that blink. At the time no other cars where on the road. As I got closier I started to panic a little because I was the only person out here. This craft knew I was watching it because as soon as I came to a dead stop it cloak our disappear. It could be a secret military plane. I also did not here any sound. this craft was very low. guessing the size 75ft across."],"Log Number":"US-03202008-0015","Source":"MUFON","City":"Lodi","Latitude":"38.138397","Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"sighting was 4 miles southeast of lodi on alpine rd.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.138397,+-121.269017(9996)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9996) map </A>"}
