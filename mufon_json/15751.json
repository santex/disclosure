I thought it was a plane, helicopter....star???? The thing is it was the only star like object and it just didn't look like it was as high as space. Now i see it every night since. I don't think it has moved since December either. I have looked on the net for some planet that we could see but I found nothing. It cant be a light on top of a tower, they blink, this doesn't. I just want to know what it is. I thought maybe you guys would know...."]}
