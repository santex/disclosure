no idea. to demonstrate, i would hold my hands above my head, touch my thumbs together and my index fingers together to form a triangle and say that's how big it looked before i caved. this was not venus or the moon. i knew how to triangulate points in the sky, but by the time we first exited the car, there was no need to do that. this thing was moving. we never reported it. exactly 2 weeks later on the 21st, i seemed to be the only one interested in rehashing that night. it was just beginning to get dark. three of us were walking to the edge of the campus where our p.o. boxes and a dairy queen were located. bob had been one of the 5 in the car. he was with me and another guy and i was re-telling the tale to this third guy, using bob as a witness. actually by this time, the other 3 that had been in the car wanted me to just stfu about it but i couldn't let it go. we were standing at a traffic light across the street from a store on the opposite corner and i was right in the middle of talking about it. behind the store was a small stand of trees. directly across the crosswalk on that corner was a similar stand of trees. behind those, less than 50 feet away, was the large parking area that had the post office and dq. there was a sudden rush of wind. the noise of wind came from the left. we could clearly see a maybe 40 foot long \"craft\" of some kind whooshing by at what was maybe 40-50 miles per hour, above and behind the corner store and behind, but not higher than, the stand of trees. there was no engine sound, only the rush of wind, and what sounded like something metal flapping against something metal. there were sections of light on the side we could see that did not look like running lights, but gave the impression of a row of windows with the visible light coming from within. i ran across the street past the trees and into the open parking area and stood directly behind the path of this thing as it moved away. the parking area bordered a large field that had few trees and the thing was now moving over it. one of the other guys reached the parking area and was behind me. from this perspective, all we could see was a an object moving away from us in a straight line. just as quickly, this object appeared to suddenly move up 90 degrees for a second, then back down 90 degrees to the same path it had been on and continued to move straight away from us. it repeated this same maneuver twice more, until it was too far away to be visible. each of the 3 times it did that, bits of light that looked like flames shot out of it and sprinkled down on the downturn, but faded before they got to the ground. in the event of feb. 7, when i first saw it i was suspicious because it was the largest light in the sky but i tried to remain objective. when i realized it was blotting out \"surrounding\" stars, i knew this was a large moving object that was closer to the ground than conventional aircraft, which could only achieve that effect by flying at a very low and impossible altitude. though i did not know very much about large balloons or blimps at the time, i do know now that these would be equipped with some type of \"running lights\", not one single white light that shown downward, and they would not be out at night. also since there was absolutely no sound, no balloon can arbitrarily stop above a given spot, then change direction and speed up. we were all very frightened at the time until the object blinked out. the event that happened exactly 2 weeks later - if i had not been discussing ufo's\\uao's at the very moment of its appearance, i might have thought at first it was a low flying plane, although dangerously low, but there was no noise of a motor. after the action of the object, i was more than convinced this was no conventional aircraft. my feelings were of frustration because the guys i was with both times, one of whom was present at both events like me, didn't seem all that concerned with it."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","Case Number":"10985","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Latitude":"32.804051","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.804051,+-81.949281(10985)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10985) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10985.html"]}
