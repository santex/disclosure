We continued to monitor the object and at times you can clearly see three lights that form a triangle and then it would move in erratic motion the light would dim then it would get brighter appearing as a circle. I thought it was a helicopter at first, but it was to high in the sky and moving to fast in different directions.it was a vivid Royal blue color. We lost the object in the clouds."],"Date Submitted":"10/18/2009 03:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.151402,+-117.158615(20001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20001) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in San Marcos","There were 2 other sightings in San Marcos on or around October 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.151402","Longitude":"-117.158615","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","City":"San Marcos","Log Number":"US-10182009-0014","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"10/15/2009 10:15 UTC","Case Number":"20001","Summary":"Blue Object in the sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20001.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Triangle"}
