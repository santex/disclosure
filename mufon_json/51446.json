It didn't scare me, I've seen it many times before, but not in awhile, it was like almost telling me; \"yes, we are still here, and watching you. The pictures that I have taken along with a short video will not be summited at this time, I can tell you that in one of the pictures you can make out the shape, it looks close to a pinwheel and there is another square object with it in one of the frames, but I did not see the square object when taking the picture."]}
