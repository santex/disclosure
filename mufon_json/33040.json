The object was high, but larger than the stars in the sky and there were no cellular phone towers in the area. I proceeded up the road and turned around and went back to observe the lights and it was no longer in sight. I felt really anxious as well as scared to see this, it was not normal and I had realized it at the time, I had thought about contacting 911 but did not. I lost sight of the object when i traveled yup the road and turned back around to observe it."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.74624,+-84.62722(33040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33040) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33040.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Longitude":"-84.62722","Log Number":"US-11012011-0016","Date Submitted":"11/01/2011 11:11 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"39.74624","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","City":"Eaton"}
