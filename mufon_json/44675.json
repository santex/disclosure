{"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have lived in Moreno Valley for the last 5 years and i have noticed a abundance of ufo's at night and during the day all mostly large orbs. this one was taken during the day it was spotted hovering over the mountains near Lake Perris, it appeared to be metallic in color and a smaller orb can be seen coming out and circling it as it hovers in one place for good two minutes before it started moving slowly heading south within a matter of minute it picked up its speed and disappeared, i attached a picture file of what was caught on cellphone taken by one of five witness that was with me at the time there was footage of the orb and more photos but almost 99% of all cellphones files became corrupted and weren't able to save this happened to two different cellphones at the same time, the other cellphones file were completely corrupted and could no longer get service connection it was later had to be replaced... This isn't the only UFO's ive witnessed out here i have witnessed this orb twice over the same area, and i have also witnessed bright orange orbs at night over March Air reserve base, they fly at a decent altitude and follow a path at first then suddenly they take off into the night sky at a 70 degree angle going at unremarkable speeds till they can no longer be seen these orbs usually appear in two's or three's around the base and Box Springs mountain in Moreno Valley and they all have the same intense orange color and they all take off into the night sky at a degree and height no commercial or military plane can achieve at this time... Moreno Valley is experiencing a great ufo boom and needs to be looked into..."],"Log Number":"US-12202012-0008","Date of the Event":"12/19/2012 03:08 UTC","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Moreno Valley","There were no other sightings in Moreno Valley on or around December 19th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-117.226285","Case Number":"44675","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"33.900042","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/20/2012 07:42 UTC","City":"Moreno Valley","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.900042,+-117.226285(44675)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44675) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44675.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44675_submitter_file1__55113045412163342531145260785n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44675.html"],"Summary":"ufo sightings over moreno valley","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
