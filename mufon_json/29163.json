You guys need to check this out for yourself. i see a ufo everynight in the sky. I try to take pictures or record it but my camera cant get it. I was laying in bed looking at the clouds and saw a ufo moving back and forth between the clouds. it was very high up in the clouds and hard to keep track of.this object was moving at a slow spped but what made me believe it was something special was the abillity that it kept moving side to side. me and my wife witnessed it as we were both laying in bed. i have another incident were a group of objects were traveling together in a low altitude and it was very hard to tell wether it was birds flying together or a ufo because the objects were silver and shiny.i am a beliver in ufos but i am always looking for an explanation instead of jumping the gun and calling it a ufo."]}
