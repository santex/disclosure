Suddenly I noticed a black object hovering about roughly 2 km to the south then moving slowly southeast then stopping and moving again ascending until it completely disappeared into the clouds above. To the naked eye the object appeared to have an oval shape. I watched the UFO the whole time between 12:11 pm and 12:20 pm. I grabbed my iPhone and snapped about a dozen of pictures during that time. I managed to capture the object in few of the photos but needles to say that with this kind of camera it does not have the zoom option nor the best quality. I have uploaded the pictures just to show the object path with the time of each frame. I would like to mention that in the area where I am located there is a high volume of air traffic at this time. The object did not have the same flying characteristics as a commercial jet or a helicopter."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/05/2013 12:11 UTC","Summary":"Black oval shape object","Country":"United Kingdom","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.499158,+-0.09969(51319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51319) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51319.html"],"Case Number":"51319","City":"London","Latitude":"51.499158","Longitude":"-0.09969","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Blimp, Oval"}
