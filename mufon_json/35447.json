( In the Southern Pines area of NC). All three of us saw the object. Earlier (only myself) saw in the distance lights and a UFO that split into two. Thirty minutes later....???? We all had an experience that we can't put together. The time does not seem right and we all had hardly any emotions during the sighting. As for me... I am shocked the way I reacted. So blah... and did not react at all. Very odd. We all were too calm. ??? So strange not to over react????? I'd like to discuss this further and put all the pieces together. We are three level headed women that are all between the ages of **-**. We set out to explore the village of Southern Pines, NC for the day and had no idea what was instore for us that evening. Please contact me if you are interested in helping us figure out what this was. I'd be interested in knowing if others saw it and if any reportings of UFOs in the area. I'd like to contact the air traffic controller in that air space."],"Date Submitted":"02/03/2012 02:28 UTC","Longitude":"-79.383554","Log Number":"US-02032012-0017","Case Number":"35447","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Southern Pines","There was one other sighting in Southern Pines on or around December 3rd 2011"],"Latitude":"35.183077","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
