Incredible.","Longitude":"-122.413416","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWalking down 20th ave towards irving and at the corner I looked up at the sky and saw a formation of fireballs that looked like stars. Then I saw them move and start to form in different shapes. I ran into the corner store and told the guy to come out. Three other people sitting outside saw this also. Then two kids in a jeep pulled up and said hey are those ufos. I was excited and wanted to get my camera. The fireballs changed formations a few times and then started to disappear in 3s and 4s. Not fast but as if the fireballs were slowly becoming dimmer until there was nothing."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13786","Tags":"City"}
