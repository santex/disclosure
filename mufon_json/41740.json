It looked kind of like a hot-air balloon, sort of figure-8 shaped with glowing orange-yellow \"fire\" or lights. Shape could also sort of resemble a jellyfish. It traveled across the sky, like a plane in flight, but lower and moving faster. Not super high speed, but quicker than the typical plane that flys by overhead. It kind of bounced up and down a bit across the sky, and jsut continued on till it was out of our sight. I dont know that I witnessed anything from out of this world, but I do know I cant tell you what it was. It was not a plane, not a helicoptor, too big to be something someone just released into the air, like a balloon or something. And it was definetly glowing white-orange-yellow, like fire. We both felt amazed, like we couldnt believe we were actually seeing this. We tried to reasonably assess what it was, but we could not match it to anything we had seen before in our lives."],"Case Number":"41740","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/11/2012 09:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.890257,+-73.094791(41740)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41740) map </A>","Summary":"object floated across sky, seemingly traveling somewhere, resembling nothing i have seen before","Log Number":"US-08142012-0007","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Centereach","There were no other sightings in Centereach on or around August 11th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.890257","Object Features":"Unknown"}
