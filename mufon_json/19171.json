{"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","divs":["sighting details9-08-2009 21:31 edt 39.9624���n, 86.1194���w i observed an object pass overhead at the referenced coordinates, orange, and about the same apparent size (perhaps 20% larger), magnitude, and color of antares. first observed about 60���elevation e. of zenith, as an orange light. after it passed directly overhead, a red flashing beacon was occasionally visible, but no strobes and no navigation lights. it traversed my entire 100��� field of view in under 1 minute. at the time of the observation, there were 2 commercial airliners passing to the south, one going east, the other, west. the aircraft was much higher and faster than either. i could not hear any engine noise after it passed overhead. (generally, i can hear engine noise a few seconds after airliners pass overhead due to the speed of sound (1,100���\\min.), and can guess their distance accordingly.) i heard the engines of the airliners after they���d passed. we are near the indianapolis air route traffic control center (zid). this did not resemble any airliner i���ve seen passing at night. i suspect that the orange ���light��� was due to sunlight reflecting off the fuselage, but sunset was at 20:05. 1. how high did this aircraft have to be, to be able to reflect sunlight 1.5 hours after sunset? 2. what type of aircraft was this? (i suspect military, am unsure of size or type.) (the iss, cosmos 1844 and resurs 1-4 objects were visible within a few minutes of this, but on different tracks and of different magnitudes.)"],"City":"Carmel","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.112944","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/09/2009 12:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Carmel","There were no other sightings in Carmel on or around September 8th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Orange light at high altitude moving E to W, red beacon visible after passing overhead","Latitude":"39.986961","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09092009-0001","Country":"United States","Case Number":"19171","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.986961,+-86.112944(19171)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19171) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 09:31 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19171.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19171.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
