{"Longitude":"-97.052462","Region":"Oklahoma","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was able to speak to the witnesses again in person and obtained a drawing as well as being taken to the spot where the sighting occurred to take photographs, which I am including here. The drawing really helps to visualize the craft much better than the verbal description alone. With regards to the photo, please notice the road in the photo's right side; this is where the car was noticed to be pulled to the side of the road and caught the witnesses attention. Opposite to this is the tree with the curved trunk in the photo's left side. Just to the right of this tree and above the tree tops in the distance is where the orange craft was first spotted. The photo is taken from the witnesses' vantage at the time of the sighting. I hope this helps."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Dougherty","There was one other sighting in Dougherty on or around September 5th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25422_submitter_file1__Picture078.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25422_submitter_file2__Picture084.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25422.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Dougherty","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09142010-0008","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Follow up info for previous filed sighting.","Date of the Event":"09/05/2010 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"25422","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.406735,+-97.052462(25422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25422) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle, Other","Date Submitted":"09/14/2010 11:13 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"34.406735","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
