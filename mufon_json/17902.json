It was about 10:30 PM. We reached the entrance to our subdivision and my granddaughter said \"What's that?\". We looked up and saw the objects. We pulled over and got out. There were at least 12 orange, round objects in the sky. It was overcast but with breaks in the sky. They could be seen very clearly. They were in a \"big dipper\" formation. They were too high up to be fireworks. Too close together to be planes and could not be confused with helicopters either. They were slowly crossing the sky. Then, 2-3 disappeared at a time. Until there was only one and then it disappeared. It was very exciting to see. There were other people out watching them also."],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 10:30 UTC","City":"Kokomo","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17902.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17902_submitter_file1__skylanterns.jpeg.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17902_submitter_file2__skylantern2.jpeg.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17902_submitter_file3__skylantern.jpeg.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17902_submitter_file4__flyinglanterns.jpeg.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17902_submitter_file5__flying_lantern1.jpeg.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17902.html"],"Summary":"Round orange.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.490557,+-86.132603(17902)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17902) map </A>"}
