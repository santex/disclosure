{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy brother phoned me that he was seeing something weird in the sky while he was driving to his girlfriends fathers house for dinner. He asked if I could go outside to see if I could see it from my house. I went onto my back porch and looked in the direction that he indicated. It was due East apparently over the city of Hamel. There were 3 orbs or spheres pulsating in a triangle formation, the did not move but just sat in the same spot. The orbs were pulsating light, and all 3 were in sequense with the others. After one would brighten the others would do so as well in succesion. They remained in same spot for 3-4 mins from the beginning of me seeing them.. after 3 mins they all dissappeared at the same time. I have seen multiple other stange objects in the skies around my house, and I truely believe this to be a hot spot. Total sightings in this area by myself is 7 to 8 different objects, spread over 2 years. Have seen most activity in last 3 months."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21085.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21085.html"],"Summary":"3 spheres in tiangle formation","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Log Number":"US-12222009-0001","Date of the Event":"12/17/2009 06:00 UTC","Latitude":"38.970046","Case Number":"21085","Country":"United States","City":"New Douglas","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/22/2009 06:42 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in New Douglas","There were no other sightings in New Douglas on or around December 17th 2009"],"Longitude":"-89.666479","Region":"Illinois","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.970046,+-89.666479(21085)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21085) map </A>"}
