Then one object flashed a string of very bright light, almost like daylight and it went in sequence from left to right and kept pulsating. It looked like a blinking lights sort of like the way a lighted cigarette will look in a dark room when moved very fast and it looks like it leaves a trail. The objects went back and forth varying in elevation. I know that the objects weren't that hight because when the lights were flashing they lighted up the tops of the trees. I watched this for about 45 minutes with a friend and we couldn't figure out what it was. I was reminded of the blinking lights seen over Mexico City. They flew back and forth, much faster than the aircraft we saw during the incident, then they flew behind a tree and disappeared."],"City":"Magnolia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31838.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31838.html"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/15/2011 08:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
