What we saw was two headlights similar to a car but closer together and on the right side was a red blinking light. We couldn't see the object because it was dark but we couldn't see the other cars below it either we could only see the headlights. We were first in line at the red light on the opposite side from the object. About a minute later we could tell by the headlights of the object that it was turning right. The next thing we knew was we saw the two headlights at the top of a nearby tree, we could see the light shining on the leaves on the tree. The traffic light turned green and we had to go. A week later I called the police in Franconia, Pa to see if anyone else saw the same thing. She didn't know."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.279548,+-75.387121(13593)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13593) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"two headlights hovering above cars at traffic light w/red blinking light","Latitude":"40.279548","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13593.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13593.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"10/02/2008 12:00 UTC"}
