It was a very bright light similar to a star and I was trying to figure out if it was a star or perhaps a planet like Venus; it was stationary and did not move. Then after a couple of minutes it got very dim and then it blinked out and vanished. There were no other stars or lights in the sky. There were no aircraft in the sky. There were some partial scattered clouds but that's all. The light has not re-appeared again since. It was very odd and strange and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up straight. I have never seen a light just go dim and blink out like that. It was almost like someone turned off a flashlight in the sky. Very strange incident."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.133225,+-117.109078(32047)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32047) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City"}
