It was not blinking or flashing as a plane would...and I saw a plane just minutes later as a comparison. The pace was fast and constant and I heard no sound. Could not tell how high it was but it did go into a small cloud for a few seconds. Then it disappeared into the glare of the city lights."],"Log Number":"US-08052007-0002","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Bright Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.536023,+-119.810953(7594)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7594) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Reno","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7594.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7594.html"],"Latitude":"39.536023","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Reno","There were no other sightings in Reno on or around August 3rd 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
