I have seen this object for the past three nights. The first two nights they were in pairs. The 3rd night it was a single light. I did not think it was a plane because there was no sound and had no flashing navigation lights. All three nights that I seen these objects, they were traveling West to the East. As the object floated across the sky, I lost sight of it due to the houses in the distance. I truly felt as though I have witnessed something miraculous."],"Date Submitted":"09/10/2009 10:52 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-83.551812","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"bright, non-flashing lights moving across the sky","Latitude":"41.671918","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.671918,+-83.551812(19232)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19232) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"19232","Log Number":"US-09102009-0026","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19232.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19232_submitter_file1__Picture292.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19232_submitter_file2__Picture290.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19232_submitter_file3__Picture291.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19232.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Disposition":"IFO"}
