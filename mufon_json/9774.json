As I was on New Port Blvd. I was approaching the New Port Freeway. There was a lot of traffic, as a 40 foot cigar shaped object was crossing the freeway. It was about 50 feet high, and it was completely covered with molten lava. It had no windows or doors. It traveled at about 7 mph. Trees to my left ended-up blocking my view of it, so I sped up, but could not see it anymore. When I got home I put on the radio. No sooner I turned it on I heard a disc jockey say, \"UFO raid in Orange County.\" Then a group of people were being interviewed for seeing a round hovering object near the beach. They said the object finally took off at a high speed. Thank you."],"Log Number":"US-02282008-0034","Object Shape":"Cigar","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.782901","Date of the Event":"11/30/1977 04:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
