Tony and myself were driving to look at this construction site for a new out-door mall. We had trouble finding the place. We came to this dead end, that was a four way stop each road wasn't built yet, but the stop signs were there. Tony noticed a red star in the distance, almost tree level, but a little higher. It moved very odd, as if it were going and stopping. We continued to watch for maybe ten minutes. By now it had come rather close. We were waiting to see what kind of plane it was. Thats when it came to a complete halt. Possibly 70 ft. infront of the Jeep. We both had to lean to look up through the front windshield. I rolled my driver side window down and stuck my head out. This object is hard to discribe, it was blurry. I said something to Tony, and right as I turned, thats when the flash happened. As if someone had snapped a picture of us, but the flash didnt go away, as if frozen. I remember seeing Tony curled up with his head between his legs. My first thought was to crank up the jeep and leave. The object slowly followed us for a mile or so. When we came upon the first red light, I had to stop, but the light was behind us. It seemed to look like a car coming, but we were the only car in this dead end. It was pretty much right on us again by now, I could see it in the rearview mirror. When the red light began to go haywire, flashing from red to green to yellow in strange rythms. So I ran the light and continued home. Tony and I arrived at my mothers house really late, everyone was in bed already. At the time we didn't think much of this. Until my mother question where we went the night befor, we realized that this all started at 7:30 and only seemed to last a course 20 minutes."],"Latitude":"34.707488","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Case Number":"20547","Longitude":"-86.741662","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Madison","There were no other sightings in Madison on or around August 31st 2006"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.707488,+-86.741662(20547)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20547) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/31/2006 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/16/2009 04:52 UTC"}
