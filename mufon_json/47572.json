We counted between 10 and 15 light ships. It was hard to count them because we had to use binoculars on some of them. Five ships where closer, two towards the North, one nearly straight up, one to the west and one in the South. They were triangular with green, yellow and red flashing lights. At one point a boomerang shaped ship flew through the sky and was solid white light, but not as bright as the others all though it seemed larger. Several airplanes flew across the sky. I believe they were large commercial air craft in route to and from, Dallas Ft Worth."],"Date Submitted":"05/22/2013 10:24 UTC","City":"Holder","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47572.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47572.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.972879,+-99.896613(47572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47572) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05222013-0008","Case Number":"47572","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Holder","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Latitude":"31.972879"}
