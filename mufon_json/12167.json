It came out of the North East. After decending it flattened out parallel with the ground and came straight towards my direction. What first caught my eye was that the front of this thing was glowing a bluish green semi circle light pattern. The best way to describe it would be like a tip of an axe head lit up in neon. The object passed almost above me and there were no noise at all. That is the second weird thing because down at Patterson Park we have aircraft from planes to helicopters everyday and you can hear them all, this thing nothing. When it passed over my head heading now SW I could see to especially bright lights on either side come to view, possibly engines of some type but they did not leave any vapor trail or anything. And lastly this thing was only about a couple of hundred yards off of the ground. No idea what it was but I have never seen anything like this before."],"Log Number":"US-08222008-0002","Longitude":"-76.602509","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
