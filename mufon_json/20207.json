{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI have just had an UFO encounter not 20 minutes ago. The craft is large and I believe it has landed in the wooded area of my property. I believe it is still there. I was trying to fall asleep after watching a television show and I was receiving STRONG psychic messages. I had the strong tendency to turn and saw a HUGE UFO on the horizon from my viewpoint. This is just amazing. Something else is out there and it is not an airplane. This craft is silent. It covered the sky and made a sharp turn in under 1 minute. I am baffled by what this is. This is traveling incredibly fast. It has bright solid white lights and a flashing red one. This is unbelievable. WOW! This is the 5th UFO I have seen this month. I thought swiftly and grabbed a camera. I have a video I will attach."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Region":"Kansas","Date of the Event":"10/30/2009 03:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20207.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20207.html"],"trends":[""],"Case Number":"20207","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.013842","Summary":"Bright Lighted UFO.
