{"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around June 19th 2013"],"Longitude":"-92.118121","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching the stars on a deserted country road near Monroe, LA. At approximately 10:45pm, I saw a high altitude aircraft fly over my position from west to east. A few minutes later, I saw what appeared to be a bright stationary star in the northwest sky. I did not notice the star there earlier. The \"star\" began to fade out until it was no longer visible. I thought this could be due to cloud cover obstructing the star, but I looked in that part of the sky with my binoculars and saw that the sky was clear. About this time, I saw two very bright flashes of light from the location of the \"star\". I did not see the object again after that. I have been watching the skies for a long time and I have never seen anything like this before."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO appeared to be a star.
