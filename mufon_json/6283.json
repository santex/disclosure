Georgia, on my way to Blue Ridge. It was late and dark. I was going around a mountain clockwise. I was near the top. To my right, thru the passenger window I noticed something that appeared to be descending. It looked like a very large modern round building. From what I can remember, it had what looked like picture windows all around it. There were lights above and below the windows. I could see there was light thru the windows. I wasn't able to stop, I was towing a large heavy trailer. At I circled the mountain, I saw it again, it still appeared to be descending. I told myself that it seemed to be moving because I was moving. A few weeks later I spoke with a friend who lives in Blue Ridge. I asked her about what I saw and if there was any type of building in that area that matched my description. She said no."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Window(s)","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Blue Ridge","There were no other sightings in Blue Ridge on or around December 28th 2006"],"Region":"Georgia","Latitude":"34.863972","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.324087","Date of the Event":"12/28/2006 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Blue Ridge","Date Submitted":"12/28/2006 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.863972,+-84.324087(6283)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6283) map </A>","Case Number":"6283","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
