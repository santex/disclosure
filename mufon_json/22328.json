My wife and I were at 18 mile and hayes, in sterling heights. We witnessed a very bright stationary object southwest of our direction. Very low to the ground which is what caught our eyes. Ten times as big as a star. We have been UFO believers for years and are always looking at the sky, but until tonight we have never witnessed anything like this. We watched for a few minutes and began to see multiple planes around the object. At one point we seen the object change an array of colors, and it began to move in a western direction. We got in our car and tried to chase it down. We drove to 16 mile and clinton river road and saw it again. The object stopped once more for two or three minutes, just as bright as can be, and very large compared to the planes that were flying around it. We lost sight of it as it began to glide more west of us rapidly."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03162010-0014"}
