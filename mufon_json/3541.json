{"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was bike riding with my boyfriend in O'Neil Regional Park in Trabuco Canyon, CA and we stopped for some sightseeing. Took a few pictures of the landscape and later that evening downloaded them to our laptop. That's when we noticed a \"spot\" in one of the pictures. We hadn't noticed it at the time of taking the shot. To us it doesn't really look like a bird or a plane so we hope you could help us find out what it was! Attached you'll find the picture."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3541.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3541.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/25/2005 06:29 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07042005-0002","Country":"United States","Summary":"UFO appears in a picture we took on a bike ride","Longitude":"-117.590326","Latitude":"33.662521","Region":"California","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Trabuco Canyon","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"06/25/2005 06:29 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.662521,+-117.590326(3541)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3541) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3541","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Trabuco Canyon"}
