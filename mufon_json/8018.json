All three of us were amazed and shocked. We were doubting ourselves of what we saw and my husband and uncle just laughed at us because they thought we were imagining it. I forgot all about it until our next door neighbor had a birthday party and our neighbor down the street had brought up the subject. And thats when my husband was telling them about what I had saw and they were amazed because they saw that exact same thing. And they went on to say that later that night they saw black helicopters flying above our neighborhood and around the mountains by us."],"Case Number":"8018","Summary":"ball of light looked like it was going to hit airplane then does a checkmark manuever and disappears","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8018.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Henderson","There were no other sightings in Henderson on or around February 28th 2007"],"Log Number":"US-09282007-0003","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Henderson","Longitude":"-114.979731","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.045645,+-114.979731(8018)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8018) map </A>","Region":"Nevada","Date of the Event":"02/28/2007 12:00 UTC"}
