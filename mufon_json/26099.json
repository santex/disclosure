Above the toll gate, but just South of the NH liquor store. I saw what I thought were fireflies in the sky, maybe 100 ft above the freeway ahead. As I approached the firefly like lights, I looked up and saw a triangular shaped craft travelling about the speed of a helicopter headed South over the freeway passing directly over me. It was dark and unlit, but clearly triangular in shape and with 3 funnels hanging from its underside - kind of like the thrusters at the bottom of the space shuttle. I only saw the underside of this object, and swerved my car all over the road as I looked up in amazement. About 2 minutes after this, I pulled over at the NH liquor store and drew a diagram of what I just seen, and wrote a description (I wanted to capture this bizarre event while it was still fresh in my mind). While I only saw this for a second or two, I got a really close look at the funnels on the underside. It was a similar view to one you might see at a major airport when a large jet is landing ��� I could clearly see the underside of the object, but it was nothing like any plane I have ever seen. There were no lights, and while I had a close up view, it was only for 1 or 2 seconds."],"Log Number":"US-10252010-0003","Summary":"Dark, close up view of the underside of a triangular UFO","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Date of the Event":"10/22/2010 07:50 UTC","Region":"New Hampshire","Longitude":"-71.447729"}
