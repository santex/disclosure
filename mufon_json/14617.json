It did not appear to be very far about the treetops. we drove straight to the the area we thought it might have crashed but didnt see anything. This was a first for me and I called police and tv news and made a report and so far we are the only ones reporting. surely other people saw this... i hope."],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"12/29/2008 10:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12302008-0003","Summary":"large ball of light coming down to earth","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
