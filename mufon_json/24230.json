We watched a orange globe like object moving in the sky. It did not fly straight like a plane would. It would move slowly, kind of floating, and would move up and down in a non-specific pattern. Finally after about a minute or so of this as it moved across the sky, it got smaller and smaller, like it was moving away, and then it was gone. I know it was not a star because it was way too big for that. I would say that it was at the same height as an airplane would be flying. the shape was not 'rigid', meaning it looked more like a 'glob' or fireball, than a hard shaped object."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Loveland-Madeira Corridor","There were no other sightings in Loveland-Madeira Corridor on or around July 5th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Summary":"Glowing orange sphere moving in random patterns."}
