I think it is a high pitched sound they emit that only dogs can hear. Tonight between 8:30 PM and 10:30 PM my dog would sit and whine and look skyward whether indoors or outside. Its a cloudy night so we could not see what was going on up in the sky southwest of us a little ways but there was a red glow to the clouds in one spot in the sky. A little after he quit whining we took him for his nightly walk the red glow was gone from the clouds. We have had some troubles with strange UFO's in the area one was destroyed about month ago with the local UFO and two friends he called in when he couldn't get the other strange one to back off, the three of them combined their weapons and destroyed the stranger. I hope that was not being repeated tonight. Since it was cloudy there is no telling what was going on."],"Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Latitude":"36.685064","Region":"Missouri","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/04/2013 08:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Cassville","There was one other sighting in Cassville on or around November 4th 2013"],"City":"Cassville","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"11/05/2013 12:50 UTC"}
