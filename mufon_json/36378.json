One of the objects was smaller than the other. The two objects always stayed fairly close to one another."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36378.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36378.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.002081,+-85.753337(36378)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36378) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/10/2012 10:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pendleton","There were 2 other sightings in Pendleton on or around March 10th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.002081","Date Submitted":"03/11/2012 12:38 UTC","Log Number":"US-03112012-0002"}
