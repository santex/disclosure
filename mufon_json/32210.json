I was out around 8 p.m. at a strip mall and noticed the pretty color of the sky, the moon and the silhouette of the trees, so I thought I would take a picture with my phone. I didn't notice any other objects when I took the picture. When I looked at it later I noticed two white lights and some undiscernable shape to the left of the moon. They appear to be coming from the NW. I would say they were planes or helicopters, but I don't think they usually fly so close together. The airport is about 20 miles north so I don't think planes would be in that position. I don't remember hearing sound, I think that would have distracted me if I was taking the picture. I'm not sure if this is anything, I just wanted to see if somebody could look at the picture and figure out what the lights are."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.423541","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-121.417238","Summary":"Two white lights appeared in photograph of moon"}
