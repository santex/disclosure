I was having a cigarette on the hotel balcony and decided to check the night sky with my Night Vision monocular, suprisingly I began to see dozen or so fast moving orbs.This is not the first I have filmed but by far the longest and strangest as it was doing some strange maneuvers. I noticed a total of 15 plus all different in regards to speed and size. Some of them looked like a big translucent bubble wobbling along and disappearing. I have videos of most. This one in particular was captured in Calgary Alberta, Canada around 130 am or 1230 Pacific time. If you have any idea what these things are, please let me know. They are everywhere, in many different provinces and anytime of the night but mostly above 45 degrees from the horizon. They are silent and they seem to be observing or scanning portions of the sky or land. Once they finish, they zoom off very fast and blink out. I have also visualized them to resemble satellites, pair up in twos or more...very strange indeed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41194.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41194.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alberta","Object Features":"Unknown"}
