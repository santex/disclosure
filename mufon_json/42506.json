I am out looking towards the east and you can see Jupiter due east. I look to the right and I see a 2nd Jupiter looking planet. I sit down and start to google a current star map because I knew it wasn't venus and I was wonder what planet it could be. I am doing a few other thing and trying to locate a good star chart and it just fell. I didn't see it move before that, and it was just sudden and fast. Like a meteor. I think it went east when it fell, it look like it stalled a bit and slightly shifted left. Time of fall was under 1 second. I saw it located about 25 degrees south of east, and about 45 degrees above the horizon. Jupiter was to the left at about due east. No noise. if it was flashing lights I had ignored it and just thought it was atmospheric distortions. There was planes before it and after it but not during it."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"42506","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
