After exploring mines in the area we prepared to settle down for the night. Our typical routine was to gaze at the stars, before turning in. We were lying in our sleeping looking slightly to the south, when we saw two ultra bright flashes. The flashes occurred less than a half a second apart and had finger like sparks extending from the central point. About a second after the second flash, a spherical luminous object appeared in the vicinity of the flashes. It remained stationary for a couple of seconds and accelerated to the East.The object disappeared behind the hills to the East. The rate of travel was faster than any aircraft and was definitely not a meteor. I said to my wife \" did you just see something \" to which she replied , the above description. We discussed the event re describing it to each other, trying to figure out what we just saw. As far as speculating what we saw, it was as if something was entering our space through some sort of portal, just a guess."],"Case Number":"14136","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/31/2007 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.787121,+-119.414212(14136)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14136) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14136.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14136.html"],"Log Number":"US-11292008-0024","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
