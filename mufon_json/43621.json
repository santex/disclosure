The two objects appeared similar to the brightness of Jupiter-Venus during last summer's alignment. They did not flicker and remained in a fixed location in the sky. While I observed them, the object on the left faded out and moments later, the one on the right did the same."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Summary":"2 bright planet-like orbs, SE of full moon. 1 faded out, then 2 did same","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"10/30/2012 10:25 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.747066,+-104.94921(43621)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43621) map </A>","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10302012-0017","Longitude":"-104.94921","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around October 30th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43621.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43621.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.747066","Case Number":"43621"}
