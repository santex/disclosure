{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watering the yard, when I looked up and noticed a rather large round ballof light moving northeast just above the horizion, not very fast I ran into thehouse for the video camers a filmed it as best I could. I couldnt tell what itwas. Just a big round ball of light moving slowly, with no sound.As I wasfilming I tried to focus the object in closer and only suceeded in getting afuzzy shot at times. It moved slowly in a North East direction, and seem to begoing down at the same time.As I was filming, I stop for a few seconds to findthe zoom button, and when I looked back up with my naked eye, it was going out,down to the size of a pin head then went out all to gether. I didnt get thatpart on film.The video tape is just over a minute long, and only has a fewseconds here there, that are my best shots of it. but even there not thatgreat. But I noticed when I slowed the film down, it does look like it ispulsating.
