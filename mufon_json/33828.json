((i am still having issues with getting a signal)) never had problems with this phone~!) i called my daughter because she mentioned one of her girlfriends seen an object in town earlier that week while she was taking a smoke break from work. and we have had a lot of fighter jets in the area for the first time since i've lived her for a year. 6. i lost sight of it once it descended beyond the hill moving east note: i have had an encounter with an alien in my bedroom when i was 14 years old at my parents home while we lived in chesapeake ohio basically on the ohio river. it was a very tall being, i was on the top bunk bed and it stood there and watched me without moving! i awoke from a very deep sleep to see it there, i was so frightened i held my breath an tried to act as if i was a bear pretending to be dead as a child would believe might work. i ended up going back to sleep without immediate memory until i was a bit older. leaving me to be sensitively aware of my surroundings. i live a lone with my dog n hope i am safe. i am now 44 years old. i still dont have any cell service i did earlier today but now it is 1:55 am and no signal."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"12/04/2011 07:12 UTC","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/05/2011 02:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Sphere","Tags":"City"}
