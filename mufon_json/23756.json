I went into a peacefull and zen state. with my mind, I sent an invitation to extraterrestrials. 2 spheres appeared in the sky (one orange and white). It wasn't Venus because Venus was on the other side. The two spheres slowly moved. Quickly some civil aircrafts rushed to the area, and flew to the spheres. I went down the hill and the 2 spheres slowly moved into my direction. On my next expedition... I will try to invite them to land in the field, I want to meet wHO are in those spacecrafts? Can they help us to fix the oil spill in gulf of Mexico? I want to know who they are, and if they can help us... According to a japanese scientific and professor Michio Kaku... the oil spill can last many, many years... maybe we need some extraterrestrial help?"],"Log Number":"CA-06142010-0016"}
