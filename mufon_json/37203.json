Bright like an intense beam of light, like a Halogen lamp. The lowest one made a quick right turn and flew into a cloud. The next one up, moved down to the first ones position and then made a quick right turn and followed the first into the same cloud. The 3rd light moved down a bit slower (still very fast) and had a trail of light behind, until it moved into the position of the last light. Then it moved into the cloud (quick right) and dissappeared into it. About 2 minutes later, the cloud(the only cloud in the sky) dissappeared, and there was nothing.It was the only cloud in the sky also.....it was a beautiful and clear day! Later that night I was looking in the sky after my curiosity had a hold of me, and observed the moon and a small round throbing and pulsating light near by the moon. I did take videos of this light and have those videos now. I didn't think about it until now, hoping to get some answers. I am an X US Navy veteran, and I know what I see to be a fact. I and have a pretty good knowledge of many type's of aircraft. I have also worked very close to aircraft carriers in the Pacific Ocean. I have these videos and would like to share them with someone who would be interested and helpful in telling me what it was that I saw! PLEASE contact me and give me a report!
