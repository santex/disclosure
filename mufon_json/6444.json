I usually looked out the window since my bed was near it. But that night when i looked out the window, some strange lights that appeared and disappeared seemed to be moving about in a certain way. These weren't ordinary lights because they were in the clouds right over the field. These lights took the following sequence: first, they moved like a sort of see saw, i don't know how to spell it. But afterwards, they seemed to move in random directions. This sequence carried on for over 3 days. It stopped soon after and began again the next year. I was amazed about this, but i don't know if i'll see those lights again. During the sequence i thought it were lights from the cars, but i figured out it wasn't. Now i'm wondering if it was an unidentified object, or a UFO."],"Country":"United Kingdom","Log Number":"GB-02232007-0002","Summary":"Strange lights that seemed to take a certain sequence","Case Number":"6444","Date Submitted":"08/09/2005 08:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around August 9th 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6444.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.516429,+-0.118545(6444)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6444) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"51.516429","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-0.118545","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
