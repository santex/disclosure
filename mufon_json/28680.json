{"divs":["sighting detailsi was out in my backyard (carlsbad, ca) and a very interesting flying object caught my eye to the south (off coast heading inland). i estimate it was about 20 miles away, about 3 miles in altitude and flying fast (much faster than other aircraft in the sky). it had a very large red light or orb with two large arching spans of light\\contrail in the shape of a fan trailing behind. the edges of the fan\\arch had different colors and the interior of the fan was white. i observed it for about 7 seconds and then it completely disappeared; reappearing after a few seconds ��� for another 4-5 seconds before it was gone. the sky was clear - no clouds\\fog. i could see stars and other aircraft. when i first saw i didn't think it was a meteor, it didn't look like a plane, maybe a rocket having problems? it was not a helicopter or typical plane. just thought i���d pass it along to see if anyone else out there saw it!"],"Object Shape":"Chevron, Sphere","Summary":"Large red sphere with very large light/comtrail arching to left and right.","Date Submitted":"04/15/2011 01:10 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.153685","Log Number":"US-04152011-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"28680","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28680.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28680.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.721489,+-117.153685(28680)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28680) map </A>","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There were no other sightings in San Diego on or around April 14th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"32.721489","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","City":"San Diego","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"04/14/2011 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
