My son and I saw this object in the sky. It was bright but very small, I'm thinking its a jet plane... I took a picture then looked at my camera,I started to take another picture of it but it was gone. It was in the middle of the sky.. It would have had to travel very fast to leave the whole sky. Still thinking it was a plane I brought up the picture I had just taken and zoomed up on the it. It does NOT look like a plane. I just wanted someone to tell me what it is. I do not belive in UFO's (not till I see one) maybe I have one now. I will send you the picture and let you zoom in on it. It was the last picture I took. I could send you some leading up to that one. I couldn't see anything in any other picture. Please let me know what is ASAP. Thanks for your time."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Beavercreek","There were no other sightings in Beavercreek on or around July 31st 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-84.065646","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States"}
