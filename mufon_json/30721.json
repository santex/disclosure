I had walked a couple of miles and decided to rest on a bench for a minute, which is not something I usually do. I looked up at the sky and saw a very bright sphere shaped object high in the sky. It seemed to be going higher instead in a typical direction. I saw two planes in the air, one headed east and the other west. This was not a plane or helicopter. I observed it for a few minutes and it vanished. When I first saw it I did not believe what I was seeing, because this was my second sighting. I also know for a fact, I was meant to see it, just like the first one I saw. It felt normal to see it."],"Summary":"Was resting on a park bench after walking, looked up and saw very bright glowing object high in the Northeastern sky.","Log Number":"US-08072011-0118","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There was one other sighting in Denver on or around August 7th 2011"],"Region":"Colorado","Date of the Event":"08/07/2011 12:00 UTC","City":"Denver","Latitude":"39.746354"}
