The most beautiful star zoomed into close range-appeared less than a mile and zoomed from East Side to West, to this arc from Stars? or from something else? I also noticed the night was perfectly clear, and the star had a bright white color with tiny green trails behind it......[ with little tiny bits flaking off-and then that was all-poof! There were numerous aircraft flying in series to their routes in the same pattern as always,and was seen by my friend in the car with me! It was a very exciting moment, as it seemed to be disbursing at the top of the mountain above at the [Mount Diablo Basin, Sunol, Ca ]. If it wasn't a shooting star-then what was it?
