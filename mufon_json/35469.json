I went out in my driveway and saw a object with 2 bright lights with a smaller yellow light in the center. My friend by this time was out of his car and we were watching this thing. It was not going very fast, as it got closer we could then see all the lights so we knew it wasn't a plane or anything that we have seen before.He has a picture that he took with phone, it was a little ways away by the time he thought of getting a picture, but you can see the shape and lights.It did not make any sound."],"trends":[],"Longitude":"-85.599114","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/05/2012 12:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35469.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35469.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/04/2012 10:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.316624,+-85.599114(35469)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35469) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"35469","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02052012-0002","Region":"Michigan"}
