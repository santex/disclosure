I was at the same location three days prior,and saw two ufos.This time,i brought a pair of binoculars,and a spotting scope with me.I was only on the job five minutes,and was looking out to the ocean. I saw an oval shaped,black object shoot out of the ocean,on a radius,and go back into the ocean. It must have been about a half mile out,and went fifty to one hundred feet in the air. After i saw the object,i was pretty scared. I didnt even want to turn my back to the ocean,to work. I did turn my back to the ocean,and start to get organized to start to work. I turned my back for about thirty seconds. When i turned back around,i saw a rainbow. Knowing the biblical meaning of a rainbow,i was instantly calm. So i went ahead and finished my work. Before i left i set up the spotting scope,and looked through it for about three minutes. I didnt see any other objects. I packed up my tools and went back to the shop for the day."],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01292009-0009","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"01/12/2009 11:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Deerfield Beach","There were no other sightings in Deerfield Beach on or around January 12th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"01/12/2009 11:15 UTC","Longitude":"-80.095446","Region":"Florida","Summary":"3 It was a black oval shaped object about fifty feet long.","City":"Deerfield Beach","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
