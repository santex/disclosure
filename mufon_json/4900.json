I looked up at the stars in the sky and something caught my attention. It was a star-like object coming out of the N.W sky and moving in a general southward direction. No sound was heard and nothing felt odd but I watched the object till it was almost right over my head. When it was overhead, it simply vanished from sight. It didn't get small or nothing, just disappeared. The sighting lasted about 45 seconds."]}
