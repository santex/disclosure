{"divs":["sighting detailsthis event was witnessed by my wife, my wife's mother, and myself. we had just returned home around 10pm and as we got out of the car i noticed out in the south-western sky 3 round orb-like objects coming toward us. the sky was clear; no fog, the visibility was excellent. the objects were approx. 1\\4 mile from us when they stopped; one object started rising and was dropping what looked like molten metal until it was out of sight. the next object shot straight up at a terrific speed and was gone in approx. 10 seconds. the next object came straight over our heads and stopped; this being only 75 feet over us; as a reference there is a power pole right where it stopped and it was only a few feet over that. by this time my wife's mother stated(she was about 70 years old at the time) that she is going into the house because she is \"scared and does'nt know what to do if this thing lands\"!!! my wife and i are still watching this thing and we notice that on the top of this craft there is a radar-like looking object turning around; kind of what one might see at an airport. this was the only sound we could hear coming from the object. it then started rising very slowly until it was gone. at this time we were saying to each other that no one will ever beleive what we just saw when another object shaped like a hexagon and being the size of a jumbo-jet pass right in front of us at approx. 500ft. no sound what-so-ever!!!it appeared to be tumbling in a clock-wise movement from south to north. i was so rattled by this event that the next day i went to the sheriff's office and told a deputy what we had seen. he asked if i would draw the objects we saw and to my astonishiment left and came back into the room and showed me 3 drawings of exactly the same things!! he said at that time that he would inquire to a few agency's about this and thats the last i heard about it. it's been about 10 years since it happened but we will never forget it!! jerry hoffman"],"Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9209.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/10/1997 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.242536","Date of the Event":"09/10/1997 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Vista","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.200037,+-117.242536(9209)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9209) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Vista","There were no other sightings in Vista on or around September 10th 1997"],"Case Number":"9209","Region":"California","Summary":"3 orb-like objects over vista,ca.","Latitude":"33.200037","Log Number":"US-01242008-0009"}
