After downloading the pics into my computer, I noticed the circle's in the one picture, out of about 13. My condo is in the flight path of Sanford Airport, which would be to right of the circle. Could it be from the flash of the camera? It is hard to tell, but after re-examination of the area, there were lights off the pool, but not that high in the sky. If you notice the moon shot, there is a faint circle, below the moon about the same diameter. It is an unusual pic, and maybe you have access to equipment, that could determine what the object is."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"28.760522","Date of the Event":"11/21/2010 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-81.289679","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.760522,+-81.289679(26695)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26695) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"26695"}
