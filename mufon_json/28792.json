It was huge. I couldn't believe my eyes. I asked my son \"do you see that\" he replied, \"yes ma'am\",then about the time he answered,I noticed a large orange cross just to the left(East)of the smoky outline, it was even bigger than the outline, the size of the moon. It glowed like the sun when it sets. It was scary yet amazing. I didn't know what ot make of it, I was dumbfounded,neither one of us thought to use our cell phone cameras. I said what is that? My son replied, \"The mother ship.\" It moved slowly at first. Then it began to pick up speed. It never lost it's shape it just floated.I tried to keep up with it but due to law enforcement of speed limit in town I could only observe it at 45 mi. speed limit. We watched it as it went over some tree tops still headed east,the smoky outline disappeared. There were no sounds. *Can provide drawing"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.717406,+-91.141496(28792)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28792) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/09/2011 09:15 UTC","Region":"Louisiana","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"28792","Summary":"A smoky gray outline of a cross and to the left of it a large orange cross","Log Number":"US-04232011-0018"}
