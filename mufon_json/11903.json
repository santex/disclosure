I can't guess the altitude, but it was low enough so that it was remarkable in that it did not make a sound as would a commercial jet. I would guess that it was moving at the speed of a private jet. It was bright and white, which is why it caught my attention. The prong section of the trident was at the front of the craft."],"Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Ontario","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.256375,+-85.316514(11903)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11903) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright white trident shaped object","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"51.256375","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11903.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11903.html"],"Case Number":"11903"}
