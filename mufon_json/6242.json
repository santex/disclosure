I thout it was a plane but I knew it was not human. I saw that it was going about 90 mph but slowed down I blinked it was gone I looked around I did not see or hear anything after or during the event I was petrified believe it!!!!!!!!!!!Then I went inside and told my sister and did not think to much about it but I could'nt believe it it distubs me and I am shaking thinking about it while reporting it now"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-84.260038"}
