I thought the number of stars to be strange meaning there seemed to be more stars then there's supposed to be. Then 3 \"stars\" or UFO's just started to move in a westerly direction. Moving slowly for 10 minutes or so. All 3 just started to slow down then they all stopped at once. I sat there for a few more minutes to see if anything else would happen but nothing did so I went to bed."],"City":"Phoenix","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"33592","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33592.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around November 24th 2011"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/25/2011 10:53 UTC"}
