They did not witness object. Looked out front windshield, dark sky, clear, stars out, and witnessed a really fast moving bluish object descending from 10 o'clock towards 4 o'clock. Saw it for only 2 seconds and it just disappeared in the sky. I thought it might be a meteor, but any shooting stars I have seen have always been white. It was moving faster than anything I have seen fly in the sky. It was long and teardrop shaped with pointed end at rear. It was heading in a downward direction and just disappeared. It didn't appear to be anything I am familiar with. I asked both my kids if they had seen it and they did not. I checked web site to see if any news reports and there were none. I reported to meteor site as well as another site which I think was nuforc. I have never sent anything like this to a site, but I just couldn't explain this. It may be a meteor, but I thought I would share this with you."],"Longitude":"-71.535762","Summary":"Super fast moving blue object with green hi-lites","City":"North Smithfield","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44274.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44274.html"],"Case Number":"44274","Date of the Event":"11/29/2012 05:45 UTC"}
