{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from work at approximately 9:45 PM CST. I was passing by a Fazoli's restaurant on my right hand side. There is a patch of trees in the background of my photo. The blue and red object came up quickly out from behind the trees, hovered for about 5-10 seconds and then quickly left the area. I am not someone who has ever believed in U.F.O's, but from what I saw tonight could change my opinion on the subject. I rarely ever get the chills, but when I saw this object, the hair on my arm stood within a second. I hope no one thinks of me as crazy, but in my photo, you can see a small blue and red object in the dead center of the photo. It is EXTREMELY small, but I hope someone can help me out and tell me what it is."],"Region":"Missouri","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in St Charles","There were no other sightings in St Charles on or around October 11th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-90.531957","Date Submitted":"10/11/2011 11:48 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","City":"St Charles","Object Features":"Dome","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32540.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32540_submitter_file1__UFO-Copy.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32540.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/11/2011 09:53 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.790288,+-90.531957(32540)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32540) map </A>","Latitude":"38.790288","Summary":"The object came up out of the trees, hovered and then flew away.
