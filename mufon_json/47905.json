{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was laying on my front step with my mother and listening to the radio, and I seen a star like object emerge from the sky behind cloud cover. It looked like a bright lit star, but I could be mistaken as it reflected light from the sun and had no marker lights like normal aircraft. The object changed its path slowly and moved southeast instead of south. Just as it changed direction, a airplane (I guess privately owned) came close and might have seen it. My best friend came just in time and added on as a third person (including myself and my mother) to see it. I watched till a high tree blocked it from sight. I walked to see it for longer but it was gone. The object had no sound and I can't say if anyone apart from us seen it but, this is a very busy street.3"],"Region":"Iowa","Case Number":"47905","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Council Bluffs","There were no other sightings in Council Bluffs on or around June 5th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"41.24996","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47905.html"],"City":"Council Bluffs","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06052013-0027","Date Submitted":"06/05/2013 06:43 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Summary":"Laying out on my front step, seen a small star like object emerging from the clouds.
