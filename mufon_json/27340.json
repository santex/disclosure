I saw a metallic bullet shaped thing going slowly west above the circling airplanes. I thought it could be a plane but it was very high up and moving slowly. It seemed to arc towards the north very slowly. As I was watching it a very fast moving bright orb zipped by going east. This flew way faster than any airplane. That on was gone in a flash.
