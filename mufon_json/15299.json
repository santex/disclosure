I thought nothing of it at first, assuming they were air traffic lights on a mountain, until the bottom light disappeared. Soon one of the other lights began flickering on and off until eventually it disappeared as well. The final light disappeared but not soon after, they were all back, but they were further away this time. They left again and came back with an extra light. The extra light seemed to move around for a bit before disappearing. The lights seemed to be spreading apart very slowly near the end. I had to leave but I'm going back out soon, will report with more."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.533183,+-119.807003(15299)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15299) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15299.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15299.html"],"Case Number":"15299","Weather Factors":"Light","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.533183","Region":"Nevada","Date of the Event":"02/03/2009 06:40 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Tags":"City","City":"Reno"}
