I was probably 5-6 years old at the time. I remember I was sitting at the kitchen table. The time was probably 10-12 am, broad sunlight not a cloud in the sky. At one point I looked out of the window and saw a silver round object high in the sky. I could not determine its size or exact form, but it was definitely round, and appeared spherical from the distance. I was able to track it for about 5-6 seconds as it was moving slowly away in a parabolic manner and disappeared from view. The object was definitely following a flight path, rather than moving erratically. By the time I was able to call anyone else it was gone. I have never seen anything similar since then. I have no explanation, and probably that's way I remember the occasion so vividly."],"Summary":"Silver sphere in the sky.","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"23.326011","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Date of the Event":"11/30/1983 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sofia","There were no other sightings in Sofia on or around November 30th 1983"],"Log Number":"BG-06132009-0013"}
