I was aboard a Southwest Airline flight in the last leg toward California. I would guess we were somewhere between Arizonia and California sometime during late morning. We were at speed and altitude. I happened to look out the window and saw a cylinderical object coming at us at maybe a 60 degree angle at a SUPER high rate of speed. I estimate at probably 6-8 times our rate of speed. It was probably a couple of thousand feet below us. It had things on the outside. I can't remember exactly what. When all of a sudden it came to a complete stop, then turned 90 degrees to the east and accellerated out of sight at an extreme high rate of speed. I heard the guy sitting behind me say \" Holey S*** \". I turned to him and asked \"Did you just see that?\". He said \"I don't know. I just don't know\". I asked the pilot about it when deplaning but he pretended he didn't see anything. Yea, right."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Longitude":"-119.411292","Case Number":"31684","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"01/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.782771,+-119.411292(31684)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31684) map </A>"}
