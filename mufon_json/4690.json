I live in an area with no light polution and it was a very clear night and the moon had not yet risin. Looking north I saw what I thought was Mars the I noticed it was moving slowly from East to West. I then thought it might be the Space Station but afterward I checked J-Track and there were no significant Satelites in the area at the time (HST or the SS). The object moved slowly from east to west and was to my north. It had no visible navagation lights. An air liner passed overhead at the same time and displayed navigation lights I was looking for. It was to far away to have any disernable shape. But the best way I could describe it was it looked like Mars would but moved. Its movement did not seem natural or I would describe it as not quite moving in a straight line. But this may have been due to my own eyes focused on it. I eventually lost sight of the object behind the wall of the valley I live in."],"Summary":"Orange object moving East to West","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04162006-0003","Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","City":"Durango","Date Submitted":"04/16/2006 09:05 UTC"}
