Noticed very bright white to blue light on hillside behind house in copse of trees;never have seeen a light in the same location ever. I watched the lighted object for 15 minutes before going to help with child. When I came back it was gone. The light was very bright, like an airplane landing light. Light did not project in a single direction; light was emitted omni-directionally. Light pulsated slightly and changed colors slightly between white and blue. Object appeared to be hovereing or was landed; there was not wavering in object movement. Occasionally a slight spin or rotation was noted in the light pattern in the trees. I felt it was not a normal object or activity. I investigated the area the following day. No signs of burns or landing impressions were noted. No houses, roads, or other structures noted in the area of sighting. Powerlines were located at point of observation. My impression is that the object was drawing power from the electrical lines."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/08/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-81.670482","Region":"North Carolina","Tags":"City","Latitude":"36.225535","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.225535,+-81.670482(34742)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34742) map </A>","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Boone","There were no other sightings in Boone on or around January 8th 2012"],"Case Number":"34742","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34742.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34742.html"]}
