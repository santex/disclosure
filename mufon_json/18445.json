It was a very clear night and I saw a bright white light travel across the sky quickly and quietly from northwest to the southeast. Another object of the same appearance rose up and met it from the east and they traveled together until out of sight. I have seen plenty of planes and helicopters and the usually have blinking lights and red and green lights. These were solid lights that were just white and did not blink. They also moved faster than planes and made no sound. I also noticed two bright streaks across the sky that were moving horizontally they looked like falling stars moving sideways from west to east."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","City":"Aurora","Case Number":"18445","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/24/2009 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.77672,+-88.144197(18445)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18445) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/24/2009 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"36.77672","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18445.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18445.html"],"Region":"Kentucky","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
