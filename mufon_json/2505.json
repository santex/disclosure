I saw a bright light headedtoward Brownsville and I though it was a plane. The airport was not in the areof the object so I stopped and watched to see where it was going. All I saw atthat time was one large bright light, it looked like it was going to set down onthe tail section but leveled off and keep coming toward me. As it passeddirectly overhead I could have hit it with a rock. It was moving very slow anddid not make a sound, a orange colored haze was coming from the rear of thecraft. It seems like I was directly under this object for 5 to 10 minutes andcould not move even though I was scared and wanted to run. I watched it go intoMexico and the next day a report was in the local paper with drawing provided byanother witness. This was along the Interstate so a lot of people saw this andsome even turned around in the Interstate and headed back in to Brownsville."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Brownsville","There were no other sightings in Brownsville on or around August 31st 1978"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","City":"Brownsville","Log Number":"","Summary":"Triangle shaped silver","Date Submitted":"08/31/1978 10:30 UTC","Longitude":"-97.497484","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/31/1978 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.901747,+-97.497484(2505)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2505) map </A>","Latitude":"25.901747"}
