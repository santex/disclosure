(a second group of people next door appeared to be watching the object as well) i should also mention, that at no time, could we hear any noise during this whole event. i took one picture with my cell phone. now, i don't know what to think it was. i do believe that there are other life forms we don't know about yet, but did this have anything to do with that? i have no idea. the attachment was taken with a samsung sch-u340 phone with a vga-camera. the resolution was 320x240, the white balance was \"cloudy\", the quality was \"fine\", the color effects were \"normal\". if you can open it, and then enlarge it, you will see what looks like a star with a reddish glow coming off the upper left corner. it also appears to have some sort of heat signature emitting from the entire surface, all of the way around it."],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Fireball type object moving north west witnessed by a group of people.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-83.647323","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.376274","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 09:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17802.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17802_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17802.html"]}
