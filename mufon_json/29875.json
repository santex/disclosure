I thought maybe an airplane was on fire, but it didnt look like an airplane. It was very triangular shaped with a point at the top almost like a fire with the light flickering darker and brighter. It held a straight steady course across the sky until it raised up and completely disappeared. I am a skeptic, but can't believe what I saw!! My husband and son saw it too. I took a picture of it, but it basically looks like a red streak of smoke. You can somewhat make out the triangular shape on the left side of the streak. I turned my camera when I took this picture, so it should be viewed with the streak going horizontally."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Triangular shaped object with flickering red flame-like lights","Date of the Event":"07/02/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","Log Number":"US-07032011-0011","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Case Number":"29875","Date Submitted":"07/03/2011 05:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
