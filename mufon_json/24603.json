It was brighter then a star. It was so bright you could spot it easily and was worth reporting on this website because someone told me if you see a ufo report it especially the time because ufos travel."],"Date of the Event":"07/17/2010 09:50 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around July 17th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.539856,+-81.377036(24603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24603) map </A>","City":"Orlando","Summary":"Red Glowing Object","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown"}
