It was a mostly clear night with very high, thin, scattered whispy clouds. No moon. I noticed during the evening that there were several planes in the area. Colorado Springs Airport approximately 5 miles away. At about 8:10 pm, I was facing east, with my head layed back looking straight up. I saw what appeared to be a bright white light that appeared like an explosion, almost like a big sparkler, which lasted about a second or so. The light then dimmed considerably and went at a high speed heading south and kept going until I could no longer see it. During that sighting, I did not notice any other aircraft in the area that were flying around earlier. After the sighting, I saw more regular aircraft flying. I am a retired Master Sergeant of 22 years in the Air Force. I have seen several airplanes and other aircraft in flight. I have never seen any known aircraft perform like this object."],"Latitude":"38.692999","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37625.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37625.html"]}
