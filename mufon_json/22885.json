In the past there was a old dirt road surrounding the gravel pit. It is now blocked off and closed. While traveling north on 13 on April 12th at approximately 11:10pm I saw an Oval shape of white lights...roughly twenty lights on the ground on the opposite side of the gravel pit. There is no access to that side anymore by vehicles. There is a railroad just to the east of there...but there is a woods between the gravel pit and the railroad...and no train has that many lights on it. The oval seemed to be transparent and was roughly twenty feet across. It never moved or made any sound. Saw this as I was driving by and did not stop."],"Case Number":"22885","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.768597","Date Submitted":"04/18/2010 11:47 UTC","Log Number":"US-04182010-0010","Date of the Event":"04/12/2010 11:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.0006,+-85.768597(22885)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22885) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
