{"Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I were driving on Hwy 42 from Boulder CO to Lafayette CO at 1:45pm. My son looked up because he heard a jet flying overhead. We were in a convertable. When he saw the jet , he noticed there was a white disc flying due north from the jet(military). He said to me, dad I didn't know the military had planes with no wings or tails. I said they don't. He then told me what he saw and I looked up and saw the same thing he was describing. We drove to a friends house,took around ten minutes. I got my friends camera and waited outside with a group of 5 other people. We were looking in the sky in a south eastern direction and then not one but two discs appeared and started to zip around the sky. They made no noise and flew at speeds that no plane of any kind I have ever seen. The jet seemed to be trying to follow them for a period of 15 mins. Then the discs were gone. I took pictures and have submitted two of them. Only wish I had had a telephoto lens. The exact time the photos were taken was 2:13pm July 13, 2008."],"Summary":"watched 2 discs zip around for 30 mins","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/13/2008 02:13 UTC","City":"Lafayette","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Lafayette","There were no other sightings in Lafayette on or around July 13th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11575_submitter_file1__IMG_0103.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11575_submitter_file2__IMG_0101.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11575.html"],"Region":"Colorado","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.993596,+-105.089706(11575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11575) map </A>","Longitude":"-105.089706","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.993596","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07152008-0007","Date of the Event":"07/13/2008 02:13 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"11575","Source":"MUFON"}
