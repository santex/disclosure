Some I have watched have dipped below tree lines slowly decending towards the ground.The other one's that travel a couple of thousand feet up in the air at one point seem to be going at a constant movement,will suddenly skip forward much quicker at intervals while it is flying.Truely,something strange is going on in the skies above us.Keep an eye out folks,WE ARE NOT ALONE!
