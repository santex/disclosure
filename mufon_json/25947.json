While waiting for the bus at 9:30am on Oct 17th on the perfectly clear sky i watched 2 airplane-like objects flying across the sky . One at the front was silver color and the one behind was black or some dark colored. It was following first object very close. Both really looked like they had airplane shape but i did not recognize any wings. One of them was making usual airplane noise. The distance was maybe fist size on the arms length. After a while the one behind just disappeared in the sky, i didn't see it anywhere even though i had a 100% open view. It was gone. The first kept flying in the same direction, from SW to NE."],"Log Number":"US-10182010-0001","Object Shape":"Cigar, Other","Disposition":"Hoax"}
