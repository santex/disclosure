It slowed down and then shot straight up becoming a pinpoint of light and then just disappeared. This was my daughters 2nd sighting and strangly enough it was exactly 3 years to the day! We always watch meteor showers and tonite was the last night of the Leonids. We know this wasn't a meteor because meteors dont change their minds and go back up. We are avid skywatchers. I have had 19 sightings since 1965."]}
