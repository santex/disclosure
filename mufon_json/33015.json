We both stopped running down the hill at the same time. We looked up and saw the object. We didn't say a word until it was gone. I felt numb when it was above us. We watched it for a few minutes and then it went from stationary to all the way out of sight in the blink of an eye! There seemed to be a brief trail as it went. Though it lasted only seconds. I never heard of anyone else seeing but I know what we saw and I will never forget it!!!"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-10312011-0036","City":"Grand Rapids","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around July 14th 1989"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/14/1989 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-85.603956","Latitude":"42.976745","Summary":"A friend and were golf ball hunting and we were running down a hill when we both felt something that made us both stop and look up.
