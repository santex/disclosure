While I did see stars I also saw a bright spherical object flying in a straight line overhead. I could only see a light. I could see no distinct object. It was not like an aircraft because there was no strobe light and there was only one large light. It was flying North the whole time towards the Great Salt Lake and appeared to be descending very slowly(Barely noticeable). I could hear no audible sounds during its appearance. After about a minute it flew too far for me to be able to see it. After seeing it I went inside feeling slightly nervous and apprehensive."],"Latitude":"40.702278","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There were no other sightings in Salt Lake City on or around July 10th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/10/2011 10:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Case Number":"34226","City":"Salt Lake City","Longitude":"-111.97108","Summary":"Bright spherical lighted object overflies Salt Lake City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
