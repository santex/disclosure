It was 11:10 am approximately. The sky was extremely overcast. I noticed a high pitch tonal noise that seemed to becoming from the west from over Gloucester, the sound and pitch rose steadily so i got the impression this was an object travelling towards me making sound. Almost straight away the faint sound of a jet could also be heard. The rise and fall of the pitch of the two sound suggested that one was moving faster than the other. The high pitch noise seemed to get here before the jet and it was hard to tell exactly where it was coming from. For a few moments it seemed to be coming from all around and I could sense a vibration, a tingling. The noise of the object disappeared before the aircaft did. suggests it was moving much faster. The whole incident lasted approximatele 90 seconds. I thought I heard the same jet later maybe five inutes. as if it had gone so far and arced round but there was no other noise accompanying."],"Log Number":"GB-08182012-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"51.86766","Summary":"A strange sound coming from above the clouds, sounded like it was being chased by a jet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41825.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41825.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/18/2012 11:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-2.229604","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.86766,+-2.229604(41825)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41825) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"08/18/2012 07:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"41825","City":"Gloucester","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
