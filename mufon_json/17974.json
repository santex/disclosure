It did not blink or flash, did not stop, and moved at a consistent speed. About 15 minutes later we saw it again, moving in the same direction, what appeared to be the same speed, etc... as far as we could tell it was indentical in behavior. We only saw it those two times, both times it came into view and left without stopping. We heard no sound from it. It behaved exactly like a plane in the sky would have, minus the fact it was not a plane. We did snap a photo of it, although all you can see is just an orange ball. Hardly anything conclussive."],"Summary":"Orange orb moving in a straight line","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Massachusetts","City":"Plymouth","Case Number":"17974","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17974.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17974_submitter_file1__P7040206.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17974.html"],"Longitude":"-70.660662","Object Features":"None, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.963446,+-70.660662(17974)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17974) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 09:43 UTC","Latitude":"41.963446","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 09:43 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07092009-0010","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle"}
