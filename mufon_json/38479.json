Three adults witnessed what we first thought to be a bright planet. It started out in the eastern sky, moving straight to the west - the same flight path airplanes take from the airport (CMH). As quickly as we noticed it and thought it was a planet, we noticed it moving. The only thing any of us have ever seen move as fast as this was, were fighter jets. This had no blinking or colored lights. Just one solid bright white light, (assuming) like a headlight. There was no sound from it as it passed our home, just to the south of us. Once it got a little west of our home, possibly over I71 south, it either increased in altitude and went into clouds or it just disappeared. No one recorded the episode, as we all stood there just watching it, wondering what it was."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/18/2012 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.048496,+-82.969356(38479)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38479) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"38479","Summary":"Silent, bright solid white light in the sky, moving faster than airplanes/helicopters normally seen in area.","Log Number":"US-05242012-0011","Date Submitted":"05/24/2012 11:38 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
