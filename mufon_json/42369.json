As a pilot I can assure you that these aren't civilian craft or craft thought up by our mind as it is evolved to this point in our history. I believe the incidents to be a string of UFO related events. This last event included various military helicopter's following both the crafts and my car as I witnessed the events. I did bring camra's out for a few day's after my last sighting hoping to catch them on camra. After a few day's I assumed the sighting would end but obviously I made a mistake to assume that. Everytime I witness this I'm driving and one incident almost caused me to run off the road. Pretty amazing to witness!!!
