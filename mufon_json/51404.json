Location Coral Springs Fl. Was outside looking northerly for Draconids meteors. My nephew age 9 and I had been outside for 30 mins to let eyes adjust for darkness. We were looking northerly for meteors when we both saw a V shaped object move across the sky. The object was moving at about 2-3 times the velocity of the ISS, of which we are accustomed to. It had about 8-10 white kinda fuzzy, yet definitely discernible lights in a V shaped arrangement. We observed it for a solid 5-9 seconds as it traveled NW to SE. First spotted to the west of Little Dipper Cup stars traveling NW to SE. The object was approx. one half of my outstretched fist in width and length. Our observations were: Silent. No relative motion between lights during transit. Seemed transparent between each light. Each light remained same intensity during transit. It faded away as it traveled toward the SE. My nephew and I were amazed and in awe of what we witnessed. Hopefully someone else saw what we saw."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.280092,+-80.262254(51404)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51404) map </A>","Latitude":"26.280092","Case Number":"51404","Date of the Event":"10/08/2013 07:53 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"v shaped formation of lights. moved steadily.","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Coral Springs","There were no other sightings in Coral Springs on or around October 8th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.262254","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-10092013-0006","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Coral Springs","Sighting Duration":"00:00:09"}
