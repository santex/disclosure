I was alone and about to head out when I noticed the beautiful sunrise. I was about to look away when I noticed the object flash across the sky at impossible speeds and left a trail like a comet would make. It looked like a beam at first until it disappeared. This made me think of the last object I saw that I reported yesterday. I thought these two occurrences were connected in some way. This disturbed me too. It just looked like it disintegrated. I am still on the look out for UFOs but have not seen one since."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Texas"}
