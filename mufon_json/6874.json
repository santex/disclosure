I looked up near the stars and there was this sort of W looking formation, I thought at first it was a cluster of stars but it was a little bit closer but somewhat fainter than them. It was also a different shade of blue. I noticed that these lights seemed to be rocking gently from side to side but moving Northward, almost kind of floating. There was no noise from this or any smoke dispersing from it. The lights got out of my view because of the trees in my yard and I ran to a different part and I didn't see it anymore- like it dissapeard suddenly. I got the number to our local Air Force Base and they confirmed there was nobody flying over our area that evening."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Georgia","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"It looked like stars in a somewhat W formation, they gently floated and then dissapeared.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.839632,+-83.269905(6874)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6874) map </A>","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Valdosta","There were no other sightings in Valdosta on or around April 22nd 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"30.839632","Country":"United States","Case Number":"6874","Date of the Event":"04/22/2007 09:45 UTC"}
