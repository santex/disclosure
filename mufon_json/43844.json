Totally blown away and mystified about it. 4)It was about 6 or 7 almost parallel (slightly ascew to eachother)long green lights. (like green florescent bulbs) flashing on and off. Holding my arms up to the sky my fingers were about a foot and a half apart.How high I can't say but my impression was that it must have been very large. It lasted only a few seconds and was gone. I did not have my glasses on so I could not see if there was mass between or around the lights. I have always been interested about UFO's but have never been one of those people who see one every time a plane flies by. I was not drinking or doing drugs. I am an honest common sense person but whatever I saw was like nothing I have aver seen or heard of. I just can't wrap my head around what the hell it was I saw."],"Latitude":"39.743596","Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/11/2012 05:42 UTC","City":"Wilmington"}
