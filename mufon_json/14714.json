(she didn't tell me last night because i was asleep when she returned home.) thick clouds have moved in (7:45am) as i write this except for a clear ridge alondg the ene horizon. the clearing is about 20��������� above the horizon (now), but the sky was completely clear and stars were plainly visible in every direction when i saw the object."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01032009-0006","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Bright orange OBOL with orange chevron above it radiating beams and pulsating.","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
