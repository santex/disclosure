Like a meteorite but bigger than any I have seen and going straight down. I was most struck by the size and color. Never seen anything like it in 37 years. Seemed to just materialize out of the clouds and silently rush toward the ground. I don't think it was any type of fire."],"Latitude":"38.776242","Country":"United States","City":"Earth City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Earth City","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.776242,+-90.461776(41343)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41343) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08022012-0001","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/02/2012 12:52 UTC","Longitude":"-90.461776","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/01/2012 10:50 UTC","Summary":"Green Light in the Sky","Region":"Missouri"}
