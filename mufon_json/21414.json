We all than focused on the object and it continued to remain in the same location for a span of 30 minutes. One from our party thought they were possibly be a balloon but it was to high up and was stationary. When a second object appeared just a few hundred yards to the right of the first object and watched the two for about 5 minutes when the second object disappeared out of sight. After around 25 minutes went by when i tried to focus with a pair of high powered binoculars and in doing so i noticed it was perfectly round in shape with a yellowish metalic coloration. After 30 minutes the object disappeared and we were unable to relocate the object."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-117.938953","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","City":"West Covina","Date Submitted":"01/09/2010 02:09 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in West Covina","There were no other sightings in West Covina on or around January 9th 2010"]}
