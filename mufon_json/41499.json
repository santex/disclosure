It was much bigger than a star and much brighter. It was a white light with no blinking or flashes - just steady - and no other colors observed. It moved at a steady pace leaving no trail - was not a comet or satellite. It was completely silent but seemed to be close. Got on UFO tracker this evening and saw 2 other reports tonight of the same type of light."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41499.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41499.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-08072012-0001","Case Number":"41499","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.920674,+-77.775065(41499)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41499) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Very bright light moving across the sky"}
