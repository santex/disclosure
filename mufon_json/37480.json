Than we looked on the internet ,that someone had the same experience ,as we did have,three years ago ,on the same road.Someone was trying to explain ,that there is an airoport and penetentiary ,close by ,and that could be ,an airport light or airplane ,or the prison guard are mapping the area with light ,to check for escaped prisoners.I do not believe any of this ,the light was moving along with our car ,I could not see the shape, because the light was very strong ,and bright white ,sometimes like light blue ,and was sinhronized with the speed of our car. I wil go back again ,but this time alone ,if I was by my self , I was going to stop ,and see what is it,but beeing with two small kids ,I was scare to stop!"],"Date of the Event":"04/13/2012 01:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-04142012-0019","Case Number":"37480","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/14/2012 11:36 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
