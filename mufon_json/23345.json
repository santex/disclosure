On the other side of the harbor, there was another dock and the dark silhouette of a tree next to it. Just above this tree there was suddenly a blue light. It looked like it was just floating but moved around in a sort of circular, random pattern and sometimes changed to white. It didn't seem to follow an exact pattern; it looked like it was drifting or floating. It disappeared behind the tree for a few seconds, and then it came back into view for another minute. It was not very high but just above the tree. It changed from blue to white a few times and got brighter when it changed to white. It disappeared behind the tree again and did not return. We did not think it looked like anything that we recognized, like an airplane, because it seemed very floaty. We could see no shape like a craft, just the light. We have been living on Air Force bases most of our lives and have never seen anything else resembling this. It wasn't unsettling at all, just fascinating."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Hawaii","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"23345","Log Number":"US-05182010-0003","Summary":"Floating light changing from blue to white","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
