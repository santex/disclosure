After we all ate we decided to sit out back and just have some conversation. There were six of us there talking and discussing how low some of the planes were flying over heading to an airport in New Jersey. We spotted about four planes flying to the west of where we were sitting. They were flying west to east. Then we noticed to the east of where we were sitting there was a shiny silver cigar shaped object flying in the same direction that the planes were flying but not on the same path. It was further south but also heading east towards New Jersey. The thing that was so strange about it was how shiny it was, the sun was bouncing off this object and it didn't have any sound or lights flashing on it like the planes did. It was also flying slower than the planes."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.182024","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.182024,+-74.912716(7825)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7825) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/02/2007 06:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-74.912716","Summary":"Shiny silver cigar shaped object with no sound","Log Number":"US-09032007-0004","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/02/2007 06:30 UTC","Case Number":"7825","City":"Langhorne"}
