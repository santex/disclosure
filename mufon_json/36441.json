I was helping out with putting up streamers and then somthing caught my eye. I told my friend to look up really quick, we both watched the sky at the horizon line. Thats when we saw a puffed triangle dome shape fly across the sky. It started out like silver gray and as it desended into the horizon line it turned neon green. My friend looked at me and i looked at him and we knew what we saw. 2 seconds later 4 black helicoptors fallowd it, they were unmarked and no lights. we could bearly make out what they were because there was little light from the rural city. I used to live in a huge metro city with helicoptors, these didnt sound like regular helicoptors."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.722417,+-117.767637(36441)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36441) map </A>"}
