As usual there are always three or four planes in the sky easily identified as planes by red and white flashing lights. This object moved in a smooth straight line almost perfectly paralell to tree line about same elevation as the rest of the planes in the sky. This object was a single constant bright white light that did not flash. To my eye it looked like a star in the sky except it moved. It moved a couple of miles and then went away as if the light was turned off. I kept looking out at the sky and two minutes later in the same spot where I last saw the light a single stobe like a camera flash and nothing else. Very strange."]}
