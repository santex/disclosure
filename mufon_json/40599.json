It un-nerved her to the point she wanted to pull over on the highway. We both got out of the car and watched two extremely bright orange lights at an altitude of approx 1000'. They were moving fairly rapidly towards us from the west...then slowed down...appeared to hover for a minute, and then begin moving south. The lights were extremely bright, in fact, they were so bright it was impossible to discern any shape to the objects. There were no navigation lights, and no blinking...just constant light. THere was no sound at all. It was a clear night with virtually no wind. We were not the only witnesses. Several other cars had also pulled over to observe, including one police unit. With the exception of the hovering mid-way, the flight speed was that typical of a small prop plane at that altitude, but again, there was no sound"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
