{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were going from Ahwatukee (South part of Phoenix) to the Chandler Mall. It was about 7 pm in the evening,and it was dark. We first headed East on the I-10, and when we took the ramp to go East on the 202, I noticed saw three lights in the sky in a triangle shape. They were in the sky in the southeast and seemed to be over the Queen Creek area, but it was difficult to tell (I left the county as \"unknown\" because this could have been Maricopa or Pinal - I'm not sure). I pointed them out to my husband, and although he was driving, he looked and saw them distinctly. The entire time we were on the 202, they did not move. We exited the 202 at Chandler Village parkway and headed North. After that, I forgot about them, and I didn't notice them when we went home from the mall. I've attached a picture from the 1997 lights that I found on the internet - this is exactly what they looked like."],"City":"Queen Creek","Summary":"Three lights in a triangle shape seen over Queen Creek area","Longitude":"-111.625269","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"10469","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Queen Creek","There were no other sightings in Queen Creek on or around April 16th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.251584,+-111.625269(10469)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10469) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.251584","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10469.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10469_submitter_file1__PHXlights.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10469.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10469.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"04/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-04222008-0015"}
