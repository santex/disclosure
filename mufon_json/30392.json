{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI traveled to the Grand Canyon with my family and while taking a burst of photographs of a Condor flying in the air I caught what appears to be a reflective round circle in the distance. I did not notice the object in the air while I was taking the images. It was only after I had returned to my home and was reviewing my photographs that I was puzzled at what I had captured. It could be nothing as the object appears very far, however I will include the original unedited images so it can be analyzed properly."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"30392","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30392.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30392_submitter_file1__IMG_4218.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30392_submitter_file2__IMG_4219.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30392_submitter_file3__IMG_4220.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30392.html"],"Latitude":"27.670737","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grand Canyon Natl.
