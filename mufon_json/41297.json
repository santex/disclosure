Watched for over 10 minutes. It first appeared as a flash of white light several thousand feet in the air. Bright with light visible on daylight would stay on for seconds and blink on and off. Originally it was moving away from me for several minutes. It appeared to stop moving and became stationary for about a minute. It then started to slowly move back towards me and became visible as an object and not just a light. It was several thousand feet in the air an appeared to dissapear and then re-appear in a location a little ways away. All of a sudden it just dissapeard not to seen again.
