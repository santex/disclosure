The area of the sky that I can see from my deck is limited, so I am pretty familar with this section of stars. The star stayed stationary for about 15 minutes then just started moving downward! I was shocked to say the least. It moved slowly down and out of sight behind the trees. I was able to watch it for about 6 seconds after it started moving. The sighting lasted about 15 minutes. I watched the sky for a couple more minutes to see if it would appear again but it didn't. This did not behave like a satellite or plane. I am a field investigator so there is no need to assign this case - I can close it out if Debbie wants me to."],"Summary":"Planet size UFO was stationary then moved slowly down and out of sight.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.094466","Region":"Missouri","Date of the Event":"06/29/2009 10:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-94.411977","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around June 29th 2009"],"Case Number":"17735","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/29/2009 10:30 UTC","City":"Independence","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
