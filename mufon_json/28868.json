{"divs":["Sighting Details Myself and my girlfriend were walking around in the evening finishing some errands around 9:30 pm in the lower haight neighborhood. We both looked up and saw a boomarang object that was almost as black as the sky, moving north fairly quickly. It looked like a B-2 stealth bomber. It didn't make a sound, it was like watching a glider. It was gone fairly quickly. It was a fantastic sight. This sighting took place at the intersection of Scott and Page in San Francisco. We noticed the object because it was moving and that caught our attention. It was also a slightly different darkness then the sky. I could not tell how far up it was, but I was under the impression that it was large. Bigger then a B-2. We both had the impression that it wasn't a plane because it was totally silent. It moved in a straight line north until we lost sight of it due to houses and street lights. We both felt very excited and lucky to have seen something so cool."],"Latitude":"37.78234","City":"San Francisco","Log Number":"US-04302011-0005","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were no other sightings in San Francisco on or around April 29th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28868.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28868.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"California","Case Number":"28868","Summary":"Boomarang object moving north very quickly","Date Submitted":"04/30/2011 01:40 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.416066","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/29/2011 09:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78234,+-122.416066(28868)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28868) map </A>"}
