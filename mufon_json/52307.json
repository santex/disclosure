I am convinced this is a genuine UFO, I have never witnessed anything like this before today. if anyone else knows anything about this, please post it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52307.html"],"Log Number":"US-11192013-0017","Tags":"City","Summary":"unknown object in sky. 11/19/13","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like"}
