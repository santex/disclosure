We where 2 days into a 4 day trip and where laying in our sleping bags looking up at the stars, we had no tent. We both noticed a shooting star that looked as though it would hit the north side of Mt Washington, just before it would hit the light swerved 270 degrees and disappeared. The tree line we where camped at had trees about 10' tall, and withing 5 seconds, a light was visible over the tree line, there was also a high frequncy humming noise that was increasing in pitch as the light got closer, (a doppler effect)the light passed directly over our heads, I recall being frozen in fear, the light resembled a round glowing ring on a dark mass, I stared straight ahead and talked calmy with my friend about what we had seen. I tried to stay awake and remember waking up in the morning and not talking too much about what had happened. We both agreed to discontinue our hike and leave the woods that day. We hiked 11 miles out of the woods and back to our vehicle."],"Date Submitted":"08/07/1980 12:00 UTC","Region":"New Hampshire","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08252005-0003","Summary":"Not Provided","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bartlett","There were no other sightings in Bartlett on or around August 7th 1980"],"Case Number":"3763","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.11,+-71.183056(3763)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3763) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3763.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3763.html"],"Country":"United States"}
