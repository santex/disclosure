(this was unusual because of the low altitude over a residential area and the fact that not many military aircraft are ever seen in the area). the jet appeared to be circling the area instead of just passing through. i continued to see many low flying aircraft flying low in the area which were likely military aircraft as well, as they appeared to be very large turboprop aircraft and one large helicopter. around 5 pm, a large orange\\white plane that appeared to be a coast guard twin engine turboprop aircraft flew directly overhead. (the first that i have ever seen in the area). at 5:22 pm, a stationary object was observed to the west\\southwest about 60 degrees above the horizon. the stationary object could best be described as appearing star-like to the naked eye except that it was too bright and in the wrong part of the sky to be saturn or venus, which were not visible at this time. already having binoculars in hand due to the \"air show\" that had been taking place for the past two hours, i took a better look at the stationary \"star-like\" object that looked very unusual and bright to be a star, and appeared to reflecting the sun. immediately upon looking at the object with binoculars, it was apparent that the object was not a star, planet, or a moving object. the stationary object was totally dark or gray on top and extremely brilliant like the sun only on the very bottom underside of the object. the overall shape of the object was round like a ball. thinking the only \"logical\" explanation for the object might be that it was a balloon sitting still with the setting sun reflecting off it's underside, i decided to watch the object to see if i could tell if it drifted any like a balloon. i braced my elbows on top of the frame of a patio swing to ensure i had a stable view of the object. after locking down my binoculars on the object for about ten seconds, the object shot off due south barely visible due to the high speed of it's acceleration. this makes over a dozen unusual \"sightings\" that i have personally observed in the westlake, louisiana area in the past six months. (many with confirming witnesses)."],"Date Submitted":"11/09/2008 05:22 UTC","Case Number":"13617","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Light","Region":"Louisiana","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.24385,+-93.24143(13617)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13617) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown"}
