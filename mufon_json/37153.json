We got out binoculars and a camera and attempted to take photo's. We are at 1200 feet above sea level and have a panoramic 180 degree sky view facing NW. We watched this object with pulsing colors of white, blue, yellow and red for 15 minutes. Judging by the stars that were out it was huge. We can't say how far it actually was as we can see a long dstance from our house. After 15 minutes it just suddenly disappeared."],"Source":"MUFON"}
