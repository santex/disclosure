It moves very slowly , but this time it was directly above me and did emit a very low rumble that I did not hear the last time I saw it. It came from the southeast and moved north west and then turned slightly more northwest after passing my position. It appeared to be heading in almost exactly the same direction after the slight turn , as it had traveled the last time I saw it. Their was no other aircraft in the immediate area this time and the Ruby red light in center mass which I saw last time was not on ( or visable )"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/25/2012 02:36 UTC","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-96.571432","Case Number":"41132","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Van Alstyne","There were no other sightings in Van Alstyne on or around July 24th 2012"],"City":"Van Alstyne","Summary":"Large dark triangle craft moving from southeast to north west.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07252012-0005","Latitude":"33.41367","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.41367,+-96.571432(41132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41132) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"07/24/2012 10:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:30","Tags":"City"}
