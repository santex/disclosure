{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was coming back from an evening jog down the road that I live on, when I looked up to the left into the clouds and saw something large with lights on it that I assumed to be an airplane. I kept looking at it because I realized that it was not moving at all when it dropped from the clouds a little revealing its shape. It seemed to be hovering in one spot and I could see blue, red, and white lights on it. It hovered in one spot for about 7 seconds and then it lifted back into the clouds without making a sound and vanished."],"Case Number":"35087","Summary":"Was out jogging, saw a large oval shaped craft of some sort hovering below the clouds with blue, white, and red lights running along the bottom.","Date of the Event":"01/23/2012 07:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were no other sightings in Boise on or around January 23rd 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.588702,+-116.251371(35087)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35087) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35087.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35087.html"],"Log Number":"US-01242012-0002","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Oval","Latitude":"43.588702","Region":"Idaho","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-116.251371","City":"Boise","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"01/24/2012 12:31 UTC"}
