It was about 7:00 pm and was just starting to get dusk. We had just passed Nixon rd and my wife looked across the road and said \"look at those\" she saw six light hovering in a line, when I looked over four of them disappeared and their was two left hovering. they were about 5-6 feet off the ground hovering and pulsating, I could see the tree line behind them and the really strange part was there was a deer and a fox in the field watching them. We witnessed them for about 10 seconds and as we were driving away they both disappeared and the animals ran into the woods."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.464086","Longitude":"-82.435749","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51145.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51145.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/28/2013 11:32 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Region":"Ohio","Case Number":"51145","Object Features":"None"}
