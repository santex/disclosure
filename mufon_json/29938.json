The night was especially clear with no cloud cover. He lives on the top of a hill and was able to follow the object for 5 minutes. He states that the light was round, totally white [displaying no other colors], and having no projections. It passed directly overhead moved at a constant velocity from the beginning to the end of observation. He followed the light from northwest to southeast when winked out. He could see no silhouette. There were 2 aircraft in the sky at that time; one was in a landing pattern to the Pittsburgh airport and another higher up identified by the red, white, and green lights. [������where you can see vapor trails������]. The object seemed to be above the lower aircraft but lower than the higher aircraft [33,000-35,000 ft?]. He could not give an accurate appraisal of the distance to either craft. He states the white round object appeared to between him and the higher craft because the white object blotted out the airliner. He denied any sensory, motor, or psychologic events. He says he has seen many satellites and this one was different primarily due its size; larger. I checked the Heaven���s Above web site. The International Space Station was listed as having very nearly the same trajectory and time of the observation. A check of the local newspapers and TV web sites revealed nothing on lights in the sky."],"Case Number":"29938"}
