She pulled over into a parking lot to watch it. It was not defined and difficult to see - only the large bright circluar white light was clearly visible. A faint outline of a round-shaped object could be seen through the clouds. She watched it for approximately three minutes. It moved very slowly. She got no photos. Only one witness was on the scene. The witness stated that it would take a dinner plate to cover the object, or perhaps something larger held at arm's length. It was at 90 degrees overhead when she first saw it. Note: Nine witnesses saw strange objects within a 6.5 hour period Saturday night to Sunday morning. They may be related. See my other reports."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/16/2011 07:26 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","Longitude":"-94.413697","Log Number":"US-05162011-0006","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.095676"}
