It had 2 steady whites lights and what seem to be random colors going completely around in a clockwise pattern turning the white lights a selective color. I was able to catch it in video for 4 minutes, as it proceeded a flight pattern from east to west. Lost site of it as it continued west somewhere over route 53. This isn't my first sighting, and since I am closed to O'hare, I am familiar to distinguise this was not a jet plane or helicopter. It was at 9:33pm, so I hope others will report it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33583.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33583.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Addison","There were no other sightings in Addison on or around November 24th 2011"],"Case Number":"33583","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"11/25/2011 12:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-11252011-0001","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Object with 2 large pulsating lights","City":"Addison","Longitude":"-87.986316"}
