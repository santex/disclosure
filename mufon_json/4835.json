I was fixing to swing the bat. when I looked up and I saw it, it was very close right over our heads I froze I could not move, I could see my brothers and sisters running, then I was able to start running myself, my feet felt very heavy to move. I was very scared. Up to this day this is all i can remember, I feel like a big part of my life has been taken from me. But I dream up to this very day of what they did. The ship was very big oval,lots of bright lights. Me and my brothers and sisters still talk about the UFO sightings. I don't remember how we lost sight of the UFO. You may think we might be crazy but they did something to use and they gave us something. I do not have pictures, I am not an artist but I am sure we ccan all draw a picture of what we did see. The reason I am speking out now after all these years and I am sure my brothers and sisters will too. Is because things continue to happen in our daily lifes."]}
