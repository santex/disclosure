Moving from south to north was object that looked like a flatish, diamond shaped craft with irregular little lights, all the same size but not defined and \"Fuzzy\". The lights did not sparkle, all the same color, white, real bight and very small-but not like a pin prick. but very small. About 10 lights and not in any regular pattern. It moved at a very consistant moderately slow speed. No sound what-so-ever. It bore no realtionship to gravity and floated through space. It was nothing like an airplane. The sky was black, the air very still and no clouds. It was like a structure moving and floating through space. It flew or floated off and out of sight into the west. I know it was a UFO. This report was placed on-line by Chuck Reever Mufon Director of Investigations as Mrs. XXXXXX does not have a computer. Estimate of the object diameter is 179.00 feet based on interview information."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.224708,+-105.271378(7125)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7125) map </A>"}
