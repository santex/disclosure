{"Summary":"2 stationary white spheres, one small, one larger. small one fell, large dissolved in itself.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was waiting for my morning ride, and was looking up to see if there were any stray Orionids, even though the shower was over. I turned to my right and saw a white ball, not moving, not a plane. At arms length maybe the size of a quarter, as I watched it, it just suddenly 'fell' straight down, no trail of any kind. Then I turned to look behind me and there was a larger white ball, at arms length maybe like a 50 cent piece. Also very stationary, I kept watching it and it began to 'dissolve' slowly within itself, til a pinpoint, then was gone. As it dissolved, it's shape was hazy as the pinpoint dissolved. The sky was black again. Neither of these spheres moved and they were not planes or meteors. Not being good at distances, they were maybe, at ground level, a couple hundred yards apart,not real high and not real low. It was a beautiful experience, and I feel blessed to have seen this, like so many others have seen. I will keep looking up."],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-118.534826","Date of the Event":"10/22/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.394524,+-118.534826(20092)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20092) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-10232009-0008","Case Number":"20092","City":"Santa Clarita","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20092.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Santa Clarita","There were no other sightings in Santa Clarita on or around October 22nd 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/23/2009 01:10 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"34.394524","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
