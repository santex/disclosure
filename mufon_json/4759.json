{"Object Shape":"Triangle","divs":["sighting detailsin november of 2005 a friend of mine and i were sitting at an old boat dock and both happened to look up to the soutern part of the night sky and saw a craft with four lights. it was triangular shaped and had three lights on each tip and one in the center. it was very dark, but we could see the outline of the triangular craft. it seemed as if it appeared out of nowhere and it sped off up the moutainside in a spinning maneuver and disappeared. it was pretty close to the ground in terms of aviation. it sped off east up a mountainside in a spinning motion on a clear autumn night. the lights were a strange tinted white\\bluish color. when it got to the top, it sped off extremely fast and then disappeared."],"Case Number":"4759","trends":["There have been no other sightings in South Pittsburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.012302,+-85.704415(4759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4759) map </A>","Region":"Tennessee","Date of the Event":"11/11/2005 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05092006-0004","Longitude":"-85.704415","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"South Pittsburg","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.012302","Summary":"A friend and I observed a triangle spinning over a mountainside at night.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4759.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4759.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/11/2005 12:00 UTC"}
