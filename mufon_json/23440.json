{"Country":"United Kingdom","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Manchester","There were no other sightings in Manchester on or around"],"Summary":"Two encounters:","divs":["sighting detailsi had my first encounter when i was under eight years of age, at that time our family lived in denton, manchester.i was lying in bed fast a sleep when i was awoken by a strange sound emanating from what appeared to be outside and there were moving lights shining through the drawn curtains.��� i got up and went into my parents��� bedroom.��� i told my father that there was something outside.��� i remember being quite concerned and adamant that there was definitely something outside.��� he eventually put on his dressing-grown and we went outside.��� the next thing i recall is standing on our drive, next to my father���s side looking up at this huge disc with a number of lights underneath it and the machine moving away.i remember my father being extremely excited for a number of weeks over this sighting as he kept on talking about it.��� i on the other hand couldn���t understand what the big deal was, exciting yes, but i think in my young mind i thought it was no more significant seeing a ufo than viewing a plane in the sky.my second encountered happened a number of years later by this time i was in my teens.��� my family had then relocated to heaton chapel in stockport.��� the month was either august or september and the year was either 1975 or 1976 and we were in the middle of a heat wave.it was late afternoon, about 3 pm\\4 pm and i was looking through the bedroom window staring up at the sky, noting how blue it looked with the odd cloud floating by.��� i turned my head to the left gazing upwards when i saw something in the sky that i didn���t expect to see.��� i couldn���t believe what i was seeing ��� a small green shimmering orb stationary in the sky.��� i did the most ridiculous things out of disbelief.��� i took a hander kerchief out of my pocket, spat on it and began wiping the window pane trying to remove any paint or dirt marks. next i began motioning my head about, making sure that what i was seeing was real and not a mere mark on the window pane.��� lastly and the most sensible act of all i finally opened a side window and stuck my head out and viewed the orb from this angle.i kept starring at it trying to ascertain what its objectives were.��� it just remained motionless; it wasn���t floating or zapping about from one location to another.��� i must have stood there a good five minutes watching it when i became distracted by a plane flying to the right of the orb a number of feet\\metres below.��� the planes were flying in towards my direction before turning right then left (making a u-turn) and then descending into manchester airport.��� my only conclusion was that the ufo was surveying planes on their flight paths descending into the airport.at one point a large cumulus cloud passed over where the orb was and i thought well that���s it, when the cloud overtakes the object it���ll have disappeared.��� however, i observed that the cloud wasn���t of the same density throughout and as it floated over there was a section that had less mass to it and i could see the orb quite clearly through it.��� the cloud drifted by and the orb was still there.��� i must have been continually watching this static little green orb for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes.��� then just as i was observing it, it travelled vertically straight upwards.��� there was no gradually increase in decent.��� it was obvious to me that this craft had the capability to ascend and travel at an amazing speed, it was like it went from 0 to lets say1,000 miles an hour within seconds.��� it moved so fast that i didn���t have time to bring my head up, all i was able to do was to raise my eyes quickly up.��� within seconds i was leaning out of the window and looking up but there was no sign of the orb it had completely disappeared.what i don���t understand to this day is why i never saw or heard in the local newspaper or on tv any reporting of a ufo sighting within our area.��� i can���t believe for a minute that i was the only one observing that object.��� it was stationary in the sky for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes in board day light, and for the most part the sky was cloudless.��� i can understand the object not being seen on radar because if they (whoever they are) had the technology to travel at amazing speed then you can assume that they had also developed a cloaking device ��� like our stealth bomber."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Manchester","Log Number":"GB-05252010-0011","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/25/2010 12:42 UTC","Region":"England","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Longitude":"-2.237966","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23440.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"23440","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Latitude":"53.488441","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.488441,+-2.237966(23440)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23440) map </A>"}
