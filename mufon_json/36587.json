At first it looked like a shooting star, but than it didn't go away after more than a few seconds,it came overhead, and had 3 faint lights on it was triangular in shape, it moved west to east and movement was faster than an airplane, but slow enough to question what it was. The night was clear. I didn't understand or know what it was, as a skeptic of UFO's I could not describe the object, and we both could only say it was an unidentified flying object or the latest military stealth plane that was completely silent.
