I looked up and saw 3 objects at a telephone pole hovering at the transformer. They were of different colors, red blue and yellow. I couldn't believe what I was seeing so I stayed for about 4 minutes or better. They started to move down the line very slowly and then they sped down the lines at a speed I've never seen. I am not a quack but I do know what I saw. I have a degree in criminal law so this bothers me very much. I did not have a camera with me to take pictures I believe I could have because my presence didn't bother what ever it was. Thanks for your time and attention in this matter.
