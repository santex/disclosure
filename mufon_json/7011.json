When he looked up, he was surprised to see what appeared to be a large commercial sized aircraft with another smaller aircraft grafted to the nose of the large aircraft. He noted that he could see no engines or engine necelles. The aircraft was a dark gray color, almost the same color as the overcast which gave it a ghostly appearance. It seemed to gain altitude, and was lost from view as it blended into the overcast. Although lost from view, he could still hear it as it moved from the Northwest to the Southeast."],"Country":"United States","City":"Green Bay","Case Number":"7011","Latitude":"44.526749","Date of the Event":"03/13/2007 12:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.526749,+-88.012906(7011)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7011) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7011.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7011_submitter_file1__0313_FinalDrawing.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7011.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Shape":"Other","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Green Bay","There were no other sightings in Green Bay on or around March 13th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
