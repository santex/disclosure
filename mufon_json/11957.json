We were in a pasture next to his house playing ball. We both looked up at the same time and saw this ufo. It absolutely scared us to death. The object appeared to be no more than 100 ft. in yhe air. From the time we saw it until the time it appeared to land behind some trees was no more than 20 to 25 sec. We both ran to Jimmy's house as fast as we could and told his parents. After this I decided to go back to my on home and tell my parents. They just kind of laughed it off. It was as real as I amsitting here now. It is something I will never forget. Jimmy and I talked about it for 2 or 3 yrs. Unfortunitley Jimmy died not to much later."],"Date of the Event":"07/15/1965 05:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Alabama","Case Number":"11957","Object Features":"None","City":"cms/jat n/a","Summary":"Ufo spoteted in 1965","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11957.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11957.html"],"trends":["there have been no other sightings in cms\\jat n\\a","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-08062008-0013","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.898128","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"07/15/1965 05:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"32.322441"}
