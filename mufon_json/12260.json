When we reviewed the photos on our laptop, two of them had unusual objects in the sky. They appear to be two views of the same object. We noticed nothing in the sky while taking the photos. the object doesn't appear to be an anomoly on the lens, and it doesn't look like a bird or any aircraft I am familiar with, but I am no expert, so I submitted it here."]}
