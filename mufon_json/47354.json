Then its three triangular lights changed to one single bright white light then the one light disappeared. we were so scarred because we were in the middle of the woods and we started freaking out and yelling, it was terrifying. it just disappeared right in front of us!"],"Longitude":"-77.30861","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/12/2013 01:36 UTC"}
