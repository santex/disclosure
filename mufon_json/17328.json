A buddy, a guy named SSgt. Mike Bugno lived around the corner from me was also working at the Maintenance Operations Center. He was a weapons loader who was on the same shift as me so it only made sense to ride together when we could. He drove this old VW Bus that got great gas mileage but was slow. One evening Mike and I witnessed something very strange on the way home (base housing area) to RAF Wethersfield. I still can���t believe this myself, but we believe we saw an Unidentified Flying Object, a ���UFO���. I wish I could remember the exact date now but I can���t. What I do remember was that it was a Thursday (I remember the next day was Friday) in April. Mike and I had gotten off work at midnight, and we had just traveled past the town of Braintree. It was the last largest town in this area before we got close to RAF Wethersfield base housing. We were about three quarters of the way home when a very bright shiny light caught my attention off in the distance. We had just driven past a little English Pub that was closed; it was just at the crest of a hill before we would travel down toward the last set of windy roads to the base. I saw a very bright light, I mentioned to Mike how bright it was. He looked and agreed it was one of the brightest landing lights (or so we thought) he had ever seen. We thought it was an aircraft landing light because the American airfield RAF Mildenhall, the Military Air Command was close and in the direction of the light. It looked like something was making an approach to land off in the distance. Suddenly, it turned and the light seemed to go in a different direction, then it seemed to get brighter and larger. I said to Mike that it was headed our way and I wondered what it was. I had never seen lights that bright before. It lit up a whole portion of the sky! Within a few seconds the light was coming toward us, in the wink of an eye it appeared right over us! I asked Mike to stop the van, and he could not believe it either. Whatever this was, it was directly over our heads and it was not making any noise. It was dead quiet! We both looked at each other as if to say ���what the hell is this���? I tried to look up at it, but I could not focus on it, it was too bright, it actually hurt my eyes. Mike could not look at it either, we tried again but nothing could be seen for shape or size. He tried to start his van but it would not start, and he kept trying but there was nothing. No noise, no key sound like the starter trying to turn over ��� nothing, the van was dead. I tried again and again to look up at this bright light but I couldn���t, it was everywhere now. I looked to the side of me and all I saw was a bright shiny white light, it was so strange! A few seconds later I heard a noise behind me, I turned fast and I could see the night sky and I also heard engines. I looked up and saw two British Reconnaissance F-4 Phantoms racing towards us in full afterburner. They began to shoot out photoflash cartridges into the night sky, and I remember thinking, why are they doing this; the sky is very well lit up here. I assume they wanted to take pictures of whatever this thing above us was. The light beam started to get smaller rapidly, and within a fraction of a second, it disappeared. Mike and I watched the craft (light whatever it was) shoot across the night sky like a laser beam. We watched as in the wink of an eye the craft (?) was gone. We could follow its path because of the light trail it left behind it. It was actually like a very thin beam of light traveling across the night sky. London was about sixty miles to the West of us. You could see the dimly lighted sky above London on any given night from this location. London was lit up now too (as usual). But this ���thing��� was now over London; I could not even count as fast as it appeared there. The British aircraft (F-4���s ��� two of them) followed chase after it, we could see the Union Jack Flag panel on its (F-4) tail. They were in full afterburner now producing the maximum amount of power and speed to try and keep up with it. There was no way in hell that was happening, they were still traveling in that same direction when the craft came right back to our spot within an instant. No kidding, it was like winking your eye, it was that fast. We got hit with another blast of light, I looked off to the side to see the British aircraft turning around to try and take more pictures as it headed our way, photoflash cartridges were still being fired into the night sky. But it wasn���t necessary, this thing was so bright you could not even see it shape, it was so odd and wonderful at the same time. I had no idea what the hell this was but I knew it was nothing like we had. I knew we had no aircraft that flew like this or maneuvered like this, this was something from out of this world, I knew it. A moment later the bright light shot straight up, we watched it as long as we could. It got smaller and smaller and it got further and further away from our location. We watched it go as far as the eye could see straight up before it vanished into the high atmosphere. The two aircraft were climbing (attempting) too but this thing was gone before they could even point their aircraft in the same direction. It was amazing; Mike and I said out loud...we just saw a UFO! We waited for a few minutes to see if anything came back, it didn���t nor did the British aircraft. Mike tried to start his car; it fired right up like nothing had ever happened. It was so strange, we were very excited, and it was about 0150 hours now, almost two o���clock in the morning. We drove back to the base and at the Main Gate we asked the Security Policemen there if he saw anything really bright a few minutes ago towards Braintree. He could not wait to tell us he had seen something. He was still freaked out by it too, he said he was very bright and he could not get a good look at it, he said he was on the hill a mile or so away. We told him we saw it too and it stopped directly above us, he could believe it. He turned on his radio; the nightly news was just about to broadcast. London radio was announcing that over two hundred witnesses called in a UFO sighting. According to the news, some people tried to take pictures of it over London too but all they got was a very bright light. They too saw the British F-4���s chasing this thing; London was buzzing with UFO sightings. I listened to that radio and then went home, I woke my wife to tell her what I just saw and she told me to go to bed. I guess she did not believe me. The next day Mike and I watched the news, and it was reported everywhere from the night before. It was a UFO and we saw it too. We decided to tell the USAF office of Special Investigations (OSI) about our sighting. They took our statement and that was that; nothing ever happened about it. I could not believe nothing was being done; at least nothing I knew about was being done! Two years later (two months after I left Bentwaters) one of the most publicized UFO landings and sighting occurred right at the back gate to RAF Bentwaters. Even the Security police Commander witnessed it; many reports and documentaries have been filmed about it since. I guess England was (is) a hot spot for alien visitors. I still can���t believe I witnessed something so marvelous and strange, I am very glad I had someone with me. I never saw anything like that again, I sure wish I could, it was amazing."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-06042009-0004","City":"Braintree","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Case Number":"17328","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Braintree","There were no other sightings in Braintree on or around April 20th 1979"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17328.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17328.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Massachusetts","Summary":"Bright light appeared over me, shoot across the sky, came back over me then shot stright up into space."}
