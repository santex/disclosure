Just thought I'd add my 2 cents... Object was traveling appox north to south. Object was extremely bright. To bright for a sattelite and seemed to generate it's own source of light. Object was at approx 75-95k feet altitude. Object was moving extremely fast. Faster than any plane or sattelite I have observed. There was no sound coming from the object. Object just vanished."],"Region":"California","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Castro Valley","There were no other sightings in Castro Valley on or around May 27th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-06022009-0011","Latitude":"37.702547","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.702547,+-122.077252(17307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17307) map </A>","Summary":"Star object traveres night sky....","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/27/2009 09:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17307.html"]}
