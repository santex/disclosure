I took two pics from the car with my window down. They are almost identical but the angle is slightly different on the 2nd pic. The two objects show up in both pics. I thought when I saw the 1st pic that the sun had flashed on my lens but the sun wasn't really shining on the lens and the same dots came up on the 2nd pic too. I didn't see the dots when I took the pics."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-88.785748","Latitude":"43.78554","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15575_submitter_file1__oakhillcemlkgen007.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15575_submitter_file2__oakhillcemlkgen008.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15575.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02182009-0012","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.78554,+-88.785748(15575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15575) map </A>"}
