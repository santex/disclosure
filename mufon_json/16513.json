As I was approaching the exit for Ygnacio Valley Road, a bright flash in the distance caught my eye, and when I looked up in the sky, I saw what I thought was a meteorite streaking across the sky. As I was watching it, I started to realize that it wasn't a meteorite because it was moving far too slow. The object appeared to be spherical and surrounded by a bright green light or fire, the kind of green on those glow sticks that you usually see around Halloween. I watched the object for about 10 seconds, during which it streaked across the sky in a straight line at about the same speed as a small private plane. Right before it disappeared, it stopped in place and just seemed to blink out of existence. I spent the rest of the day trying to find out if there were any reports of meteorites or plane crashes, but I couldn't find anything."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Walnut Creek","There were no other sightings in Walnut Creek on or around November 30th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16513.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16513.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","City":"Walnut Creek","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04152009-0003","Case Number":"16513"}
