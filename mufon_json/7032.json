(an experience we'll never forget, and unexplainably remembered as only about 3 years ago.) although there were slight differences in this report, the main framework remained the same and consistent. even though the youtube video broadcast supposedly took place in a different geographical location(maybe phoenix or arizona)..the resulting phenomena were too similiar to ignore. finally, we were finding similarities & connections to an event that sent chills down my spine & caused my hair to stand on end. although i felt profound relief and not fear. it's as if a light came on...click! never one to leave well enough alone, or give up..i was determined to go back to that late night several years ago to see if i could once and for all settle the disturbing thoughts running rampant in my mind. i figured i had one of 2 choices: 1)plan a: research all scientific data and prove to myself it was most possibly & logically a \"meteor\" as suggested by some eye witnesses & authorities. (to my knowledge never proven & put under the rug) 2)plan b: if plan a failed admit we were not alone in this universe... plan a failed"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7032.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7032.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/26/1999 01:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"31.032782","Date of the Event":"12/26/1999 01:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
