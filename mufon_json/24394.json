As soon as she got outside she called to me about a large white light flying across the sky. I have told her of several experiences I have had from my own yard before so she has since been paying extra attention to the sky. I jumped up immediately and stuck my head out side to see a large, bright white light (circular or orb shaped) traveling east, towards Lake Michigan. I knew that it was not a craft civilians are aware of due to to the lack of any FAA lights, it's size and intensity. I jumped back inside to grab my binoculars which are literally 3 feet inside my door. It took no longer than three seconds and within that time, whatever it was completely disappeared. My Girlfriend described how it disappeared as fading out. The night sky was oddly clear. We have light pollution issues normally but visibility tonight was exceptional. The whole sighting lasted no more than 15 seconds leaving us no time to take video or pictures."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07102010-0004","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.283892,+-87.831146(24394)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24394) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/10/2010 01:06 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lake Bluff","There were no other sightings in Lake Bluff on or around July 9th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
