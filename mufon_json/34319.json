The object was moving fast and appeared to dip or drop in altitude and then flatten out again. It was out of sight in 4 seconds or less. Made no sound and displayed no tail or trail of sparks. The object flew in essentially a straight line at a constant speed. Speed appeared to greatly exceed a commercial jet liner. First thought it was remnant of a firework. We noticed it because it was bright; very crisp in appearance. We were rather speechless at first then we starrted sharing our amazement. We lost sight as it went behind trees."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Case Number":"34319","Longitude":"-77.090492","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/26/2011 01:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.18016,+-77.090492(34319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34319) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Olney","There were no other sightings in Olney on or around December 24th 2011"],"Latitude":"39.18016","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12262011-0011"}
