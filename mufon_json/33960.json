I looked up the sky. It was a clear December Sky. The moon was shining bright on the East. I was walking towards west. Towards the south-west direction I saw two stars. In between the two stars I saw another \"star-like\" object. It was bright red. Suddenly it started blinking fast. It was blinking from red to white and white to red. I kept on watching it and then it suddenly started moving in random direction. I have never seen any earthly object change its position so rapidly. It was doing this for some time and then it suddenly vanished after 15 minutes. I felt amazed and thrilled as this was my first U.F.O experience."],"Case Number":"33960","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/11/2011 08:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
