{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking a photo at night of a rare car when I noticed in the north east distance there was a strange pulsating orb traveling south. at first I just assumed it was a plane... but as I kept looking I realized it was round and just sort of floating. it caused a strange low frequency humming in my ears as it neared. it quickly changed direction and headed east towards the mountains and faded away. tried to take a photo or video but my phone would not do it. the guy in the car I was photographing also could not get his car to start. both my phone and his car worked fine after the orb disappeared. he said he wanted nothing to do with \"this s**t\" and took off."],"Case Number":"51520","Summary":"glowing orange/white/pink/yellow orb floated through the sky (like a high altitude plane), quickly changed direction and faded away","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Log Number":"US-10132013-0020","Date Submitted":"10/13/2013 06:19 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.666446,+-122.376196(51520)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51520) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"47.666446","Date of the Event":"10/12/2013 09:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51520.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51520.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around October 12th 2013"],"Longitude":"-122.376196","City":"Seattle","Country":"United States"}
