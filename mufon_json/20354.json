{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was on interstate 70 traveling east by lakeside amusement park. i was riding in the backseat of a taxi and noticed something hovering to the south of the interstate. i watched it thinking it had to be a helicopter because it wasnt moving like airplanes do. i also notised the sun reflecting off of the bottom of it and it was a shiny silver. It didnt last long but then it just shot right up into the sky and i watched it vanish. it wasnt like anything i've ever seen before. It all happened so fast but i'm sure it wasnt an airplane or helicopter."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-104.975243","City":"Denver","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20354.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11072009-0002","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"39.741554","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"11/07/2009 01:01 UTC","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around November 6th 2009"],"Region":"Colorado","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"11/06/2009 03:20 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.741554,+-104.975243(20354)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20354) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Case Number":"20354","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"silver object hovered in the sky and shot straight up fast and was gone","Object Features":"Unknown"}
