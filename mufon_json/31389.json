Out the window i saw a bright redish light in the sky. i immediately said something and we stopped the car. We then noticed there were two of them moving in the same direction as one another but flying at different altitudes. We watched it for about a minute and turned the car around. We followed the lights and then they dissapeared behind a patch of trees. The weird thing was is that if they stayed the same altitude we should have seen them come out the other side of the trees but it seemed like they dissapeared into thin air. We drove around the area and saw a man looking into the sky near where we spotted the objects."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"31389","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Havertown","There were no other sightings in Havertown on or around July 1st 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31389.html"],"Summary":"My Dad and my friend saw two fireballs in the sky"}
