I took a picture of the beautiful sunset from the window of my home office, and minutes later, appeared what a thought to be a smoke and vapor from a plane at high altitude. But the object traveled very fast (angular velocity from my vantage point) and didn't leave anything behind, but moved like a whole thing (different from meteorites I observed on similar conditions years ago. I just had time to take two shots before it disappear behind the mountain. I changed the sensibility of the camera in some seconds between them. It didn't look to me, exactly like a plane, meteorite, cloud, or planet, so I have no explanation."],"Summary":"Observation of an apparently gaseous v shaped object moving close to the sunset.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"BR-02042010-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21776_submitter_file1__DSCN1887.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21776_submitter_file2__DSCN1895.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21776_submitter_file3__DSCN1896.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21776.html"],"Case Number":"21776","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Light","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"02/04/2010 06:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang","City":"Rio de Janeiro","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Rio de Janeiro","There were no other sightings in Rio de Janeiro on or around February 4th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
