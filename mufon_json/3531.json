I was holding a pear of my boxers. I was little,and I would always look arround to see my surroundings out of fear of a animal would attack me. That is when I saw a large suacer. The suacer had at least 30 red lights all arround the edge of it. It was very big. It moved across the sky slowy. It was not a plane or helicopter, because I love planes and helicopters,and I know what they look like and sound like. It did not make any sounds. I saw it in the sky for about 15-20 seconds. I was scared so I ran down to my front purch. At first I thought it was a planes but I soon raelized it was not. I told my mom and she did not understand what I was describing to her. I lost sight of it when it started to head towards the woods and then it disappeared into the wood."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON"}
