{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOriginally reported to UFOs Northwest: I also witnessed something similar while driving on I-5 from Portland to Eugene! I looked out to the coast range to the West, and very far off in the distance over the range a bright row of white lights appeared to turn on in the sky. The row must have been quite large and there appeared to be some kind of energy waving between them. They were much like arc lights. I believe that what I was seeing was some kind of platform seen in perspective with the lights underneath. They were visible for about 20 seconds and then they appeared to turn in the sky and then turn off. I was very surprised. I continued on I-5, and about 30 seconds later as I was looking toward Eugene I saw them reappear in the sky toward the south, with exactly the same appearance. Then they appeared to turn direction and slowly turned off!"],"trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Salem","There was one other sighting in Salem on or around May 14th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-06112010-0008","Date of the Event":"05/14/2010 07:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23700.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23700.html"],"Summary":"Large line of lights/orbs moving together.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Salem","Country":"United States","Case Number":"23700","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","Latitude":"44.949608","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.949608,+-123.030096(23700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23700) map </A>","Longitude":"-123.030096","Date Submitted":"06/11/2010 05:31 UTC"}
