I saw them flying by for a few minutes. Since I was just sitting in the passenger seat I couldn't really stop and look. I tried taking pictures of the lights with my cellphone but since in the moving car and they weren't so close it would come out too blurry. Well my friend just kept driving.. so eventually i just lost sight of it."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-78.794776"}
