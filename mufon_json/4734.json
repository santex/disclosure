The object appeared from behind the neighbor���s house situated to the south. It traveled very fast and made no noise at all. The vehicle travel south to north. It was about the size of a B-52 at 1000 ft. altitude. If it were a jet or an airplane it would have made some sound. And if it was so high that I could hear it then it would have traveled much slower through my field of view. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. The craft disappeared from my view when it went behind the neighbor���s house that was situated to the north. I stood up and ran around to the front house but was unable to see anything. The sighting lasted less than 10 seconds. The craft was V shaped with 5 orange lights on the bottom of the wings. 1 light was on the tip of the V and 1 light on each wing tip. There was another light midway between the two lights on each wing. There are videos recorded in Arizona that show craft very similar to what I saw that night in Montana."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.7125,+-104.161389(4734)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4734) map </A>","Case Number":"4734"}
