{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were on highway 20 headed to williams, when I noticed lights hung over a field where they shouldn't be. I told my husband who also thought it was odd. The lights started comming toward us, we pulled over and got out of the car and stood on the side of the road these lights flew over us very very low we heard no sound the wind didn't move nothing we watched the lights quickly assend then 3 took off in one direction the 4th in another. We watched the one for more than 20 minutes until it shot stright up like the others had. To this day we are still in shock. My husband is a retired peace officer and a retired noncom from the national guard. He was a non believer until that day."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Williams","Longitude":"-122.149419","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"07/31/2005 10:36 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Summary":"4 burnt orange balls of light in formation then zooming off.","Latitude":"39.154614","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15110.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Williams","There were no other sightings in Williams on or around July 31st 2005"],"Log Number":"US-01242009-0014","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.154614,+-122.149419(15110)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15110) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"15110","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/31/2005 10:36 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
