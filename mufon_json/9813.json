I'm in Tujunga and we can see the fire just popping over the ridge here at 7:20pm when I took the pics. I didn't notice the black object until I showed them to my husband. However it only appeared in that single pic and we've been watching intently to see if maybe it was a helicopter but have not seen any whatsoever in the sky. Cause of fire is supposedly lightning and it's 102 degrees + right now."],"City":"Los Angeles","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were 2 other sightings in Los Angeles on or around September 2nd 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-118.305281","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"UFO in Acton CA Fire","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.252103,+-118.305281(9813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9813) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.252103","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"09/02/2007 07:15 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/02/2007 07:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9813_submitter_file1__006.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9813_submitter_file2__006-1Analysis.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9813_submitter_file3__006Crop.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9813.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang"}
