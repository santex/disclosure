It was around 7pm. I saw what I thought was a large firework that was moving up into the NW sky from behind the houses across the street. I was watching to see if it would explode since it is New Year's weekend. However, it kept ascending and looked like a rocket with fire coming out. As it ascended higher in the sky the fire dissipated and it moved higher and higher into the sky until it disappeared as a spot in the sky. We are about 2 hours south of Cape Canaveral, so I went to check the NASA launch schedule and nothing was scheduled for today. My husband and my niece also saw the object. We were all baffled by what it could be."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/02/2011 09:17 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/02/2011 07:00 UTC","Longitude":"-80.248586","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"What initially looked like a large firework going up behind a neighbors house, continue to ascend and then move across the sky until out of sight.","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Square, Rectagular, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"27.204948","Log Number":"US-01022011-0015","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Stuart","There were no other sightings in Stuart on or around January 2nd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"27215","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Stuart","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27215.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27215_submitter_file1__ufo1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27215_submitter_file2__ufo2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27215_submitter_file3__ufo3.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27215.html"]}
