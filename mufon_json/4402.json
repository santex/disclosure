As we exited the south side of the V, I saw a darkened area in the sky where there were no stars shining. I then saw what appeared to be the flat bottom of a craft hovering just over the crest of the east side embankment. The botton of the craft had about eight lights of different colors ranging from red to yellow to orange. I said to the driver...O M G...tell me you see what I am seeing. The driver followed my gaze and looked in the direction I was looking. He immediately jerked the steering wheel to the right hand shoulder of the road and we looked through the drivers side window and out the back window of the car. The object was gone. We never even discussed it between ourselves. We both, I suppose just felt it would probably be in our best interest to not tell anyone or even acknowledge it ever happened or people might think we were NUTS!"],"Log Number":"US-02082006-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.473132,+-84.815783(4402)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4402) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4402.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4402.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.815783","Object Features":"Dome","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hustonville","There were no other sightings in Hustonville on or around December 15th 1983"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
