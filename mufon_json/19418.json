It looked like a large spotlight shining down but to high in the sky and too bright to be a helicopter. We are in rural area. It grew in size and intensity and then the source at the top of the cone went out. There was a glowing haze that lingered for 15-20 seconds. Clear and not a cloud in the sky, and no fog in the area. It was bizarre and amazing. I felt like we were seeing something incredible."],"Longitude":"-72.247887","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
