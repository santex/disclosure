{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were sitting in a friend's backyard around a fire pit when he told us to check out the moon rising above his neighbor's house. His wife and I both looked; I was standing in the yard and she said \"what's that?!\" I looked and saw it, too. It was brilliantly white, shaped like a real skinny cigar, and racing across the sky faster than any airplane. It was gone almost as soon as we saw it. Two people with us didn't see it, and they know I'm a UFO believer, but the other witness is not. In fact, she was a skeptic prior to this event. I didn't think I would ever see one, particularly since I live 3 miles from Langley AFB. This was not an airplane, I have lived around Langley all my life and know every airplane the Air Force flies. It traveled MUCH faster and was completely white across the entire body."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.065072,+-76.325102(32611)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32611) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/15/2011 11:47 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32611.html"],"City":"Hampton","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar","Log Number":"US-10152011-0019","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"37.065072","Longitude":"-76.325102","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Hampton","There were no other sightings in Hampton on or around October 15th 2011"],"Region":"Virginia","Case Number":"32611","Date of the Event":"10/15/2011 10:15 UTC","Summary":"Raced across sky, slower than meteor, FASTER than jets at low, close approach"}
