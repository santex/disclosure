You will need a video camera with a rather long lens (I use a Canon G2) as these craft are not visible to the unaided eye due to speed, distance and you will be looking directly toward the sun. I have nearly five hours of video tape (DV) and about 3,000 digital stills (Sony 828) shot in a number of locations at different times over the last two years in Oregon and California. These craft can be photographed any time the sun is shining. Did you get that? This is not a one time event��� I get the same results every time I set up my camera, every time. I have a theory that we can hail these craft. Are you ready for contact? There is one craft that is most prevalent but by no means the only type seen. One appears to be manufactured on earth most likely by a secret program of the US military. It looks like a conventional fighter jet except for whatever powers it makes a bright light originating from the wing tips that crosses the middle of the fuselage making it look much like a dragonfly. It is extremely fast perhaps 10 to 20 miles per second.
