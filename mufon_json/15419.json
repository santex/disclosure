Recently I was on Caribbean on St. Martin island. We took a taxi and made an observe excursion. I was there for first time, so I made a lot of pictures. Also I made a lot of pictures of beautiful landscape on one viewing platform. Only while looking throught the pictures at my computer I discovered the images of UFO. 4 spheres at equal distance from each other. 2 of them shined, the third- half shined and the forth had a steel colour. I found only on the one photo the imagine of UFO, but I made 3 pictures of the same place in an interval no more than one minute."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"The picture of 4 UFOs on St.Martin Island.","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball, Sphere","Longitude":"-81.509174","Source":"MUFON","trends":[""],"Latitude":"27.668927","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
