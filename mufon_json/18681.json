I looked up and we both saw two roundish firery objects. One in front of the other. The second object looked the same and was flanked behind the first object (not directly behind it). The second object appeared a little larger than the first. They appeared to be below the atmosphere but is hard to tell how high up they were. I have viewed the space shuttle for many years and can say these objects behaved like a satelite or the shuttle behaves; no sound, straight line movement, and these objects faded away in the northeast sky much like the shuttle or a satelite. The objects were bright. Much brighter than Jupiter this time of year and with more mass. Orange, yellow appearance and they flickered like a flame. Again, they both moved in a straight line with no turns or variations. from southwest to northeast. My wife and I could not explain these objects and were quite excited about the sighting."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/14/2009 09:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Frankfort","There were no other sightings in Frankfort on or around August 14th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.495866,+-87.848661(18681)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18681) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Frankfort","Summary":"Two fiery objects came across the sky in a straight line.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.848661","Region":"Illinois","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/14/2009 09:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-08152009-0005","Tags":"City"}
