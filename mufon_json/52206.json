I looked up to see a group of orange objects moving West in a cluster like a loss diamond maybe 10. This was the leading edge of a long trail of singles and small groups maybe 3 or so trailing from the east. In the whole lot about 20 to 25. By the time I got my camera from the house to take the accompany picture only 4 were left that I circled in green. Nothing on the local TV WWSB in Sarasota How did I feel WOW. Waiting a long time to see something like this like 78 years. My wife came out of the house and also seen them. I am a professional photographer by trade.
