I looked out her window and saw what I thought to be flares. I stopped the car out of curiosity and got out to get a better look. I noticed they werent falling like flares and were in fact moving into a formation. When we first spotted them they were in a cluster kind of floating off the ground ( maybe a few thousand feet). Then they started one by one heading North up the savannah river. They moved off slowly and silently and disappeared after a few mins of viewing. It was raining lightly and there was heavy clous cover so they couldnt have been far off the ground. No noise, very strange event. Called the news and they said we werent the only ones calling it in."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27199.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27199.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Augusta","Region":"Georgia","Summary":"7 Orange balls, in cluster than single file","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/01/2011 10:26 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.481336"}
