As I turned to look toward my bedroom dresser I heard an \"click\", at the same time of the \"click\" I saw an \"blue-flash\" light go from the top of my dresser to my ceiling! I could see the ray of \"light\" travel from the top of my dresser up to my bedroom ceiling. The size of the light on the ceiling was a little smaller than an basketball. When I turned my bedroom light on, I looked on my dresser and there was nothing there. All I know is the light came from INSIDE of my bedroom, not from the OUTSIDE!! I looked out the window and everything look normal. What could this be? Was the \"blue light\" the reason I became restless and woke up? I'm confused!! The color of blue reminded of the Blue(Led) light on the laptop computers! (the power light that lightes up in the front) Thanks!"],"Log Number":"US-10092010-0011","Latitude":"32.161745","Tags":"City","Region":"Georgia"}
