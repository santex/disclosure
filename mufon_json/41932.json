My boyfriends mom and I had gone out for dinner and we were on our way back to her house when we noticed unrelated police activity at the entrance to her subdivision. Very nice neighborhood so we were both shocked to see 6+ police cars near one of the first houses on the access road. Anyway, as we drove past I glanced out the windshield (as she was driving) and saw for a few seconds this bright, pastel greenish orb shoot across the sky. My reaction was suitable for such a startling occurrence, \"what the hell was that?!\". She didn't see it, but I saw it long enough to know that it wasn't a meteorite or a comet of any sorts. It did not have a tail and was the intensity of the brightness did not change either."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Virginia","Object Features":"Dome","Summary":"Startled - took me by complete surprise"}
