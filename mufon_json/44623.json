Almost resembling the brightness of a plane's light during take off. However, this was no plane with no path. It hovered stationary in the sky moving from time to time in a swaying mode. Observed a strong jolt of the object then remained stationary. When we watched the sighting there was not a cloud in the sky. During, I ran inside to get my phone and my compass. When I came back the sky was filled with clouds and the object remained unseen. Fog had abruptly swept to my doorstep. My Dad and I thought the whole thing was very strange and we decided it best to go back inside."],"Region":"Georgia","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
