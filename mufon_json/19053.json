I know there are no houses up there I was not sure what it was. And it just disappeared. It kinda danced around some almost appeared it floated above the top of the hills. I could not tell what it was from a distance but it was a very bright light. I have never seen anything like it before. It was dark out and I could not compare it to anything that I have seen before. It appeared in some ways to be watching me or I could see it.It was right in my line of sight."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"39.544271","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"09/03/2009 01:11 UTC"}
