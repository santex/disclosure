I pointed to the sky for her to look at it and it was distinct right away. It was flying at incredibly high speed burning red ball looking object. As it was flying our way at about a helicopter height more people joined us to observe it. As it was flying over us it just disappeared in the thin air and we all freaked out. After that the incident just felt so surreal. I was trying to think back of the object but i felt like it was in my dream. And no i wasn't drunk :))"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Latitude":"41.991731","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Chicago"}
