PS: about 3 days ago local Tv stations have reported that 8 Israeli jet fighters were seen over the sky in Lebanon, i don't know if this is related but i wonder if they had seen these UFOs on their radar screen and have scrambled these jets to check what were they, as i said this was 3 or maybe 4 days ago before this incident, 8 jets is a high number usually they send 2 or 3 max since Lebanon is a small country"],"Date Submitted":"09/21/2009 10:46 UTC","City":"Batroon","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.622955,+-93.981024(19542)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19542) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"LB-09212009-0017"}
