It was a very windy day but asI snapped this shot an extremely strong gust of wind knocked me off balance. Idid not see anything unusual through the cameras viewfinder when I took theshot but the wind gust sounded like a loud roar. I had my film developed at thelocal Wal-mart and questioned the employee about the object on the right handside of this photo and he assured me the object was on the negative. I had thepicture enlarged at a camera shop in Austin. I have pondered its origin andsubmitted the picture to Art Bell (e-mail) but have not received a reply. Sometimes I feel I should drop my inquiry but it would be meaningful to get someprofessional feedback.
