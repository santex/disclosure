{"Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my patio at about 8 PM facing West when a quiet, brightly glowing disc shaped craft suddenly appeared at approximately 5,000 - 10,000 feet 10 miles East of Dresden Nuclear power plant. It flew West over Dresden and passed a military jet which was about 2 miles South of the object and several thousand feet higher. The disc was moving about twice as fast as the military jet and continued West towards the horizon. It would have been impossible for anyone looking at the sky in that direction to have missed it as the object was VERY bright, very fast, made no sound and left no contrail."],"Longitude":"-88.201729","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Case Number":"39653","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Shorewood","There were 3 other sightings in Shorewood on or around June 19th 2012"],"City":"Shorewood","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/19/2012 08:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39653.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39653.html"],"Summary":"Bright glowing disc appeared & then flew West over Dresden nuclear power plant & continued West past military plane which was heading East","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.52003,+-88.201729(39653)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39653) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.52003","Log Number":"US-06202012-0025","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/20/2012 11:17 UTC"}
