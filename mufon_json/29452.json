She kept barking to the south. I was looking all around the neighborhood not seeing anything. She was racing around and i happened to look up facing the south already and seen the same object I viewed on May 20th. It was just hovering above the graveyard at the end of our street.I came in the house for camera and a witness. We stood there and watched it a few minutes and it took off to the southeast very slow moving. The white background lighted the object but i couldn't tell the shape of it. It had red lights all around it.. nothing blinked. It was pretty high up off the ground but I cant say for sure how high it was. With my dog still being nutty I brought her in and locked the doors. Chalked it up as yet another UFO sighting out here in the country. The photos I attempted to take didn't turn out."],"Summary":"White lit object of unknown shape lined with red lights sitting stationary over a graveyard.","Date of the Event":"06/08/2011 03:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.905786","Case Number":"29452","Latitude":"41.007778"}
