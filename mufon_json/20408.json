Not sure! It was white like a star and going a bit faster than a regular plane and No flashing lights like a cessna or something. It traveled a bit thru the sky then dissapears when the 4 regular airplanes were about to intersect. Two planes from left and two from right and at the intersection point the object dissapears. I find myself doubting that it was an UFO, but may have been. Not sure, I would like an explanation though. There have been other nights when i see what i think is a star until it moves around in the same general location...could be a satelite moving or something...but that was other nights. Tonight im pretty sure it was something!! There were no clouds in the sky so this object couldnt have dissapeared behind clouds."],"Date Submitted":"11/09/2009 07:43 UTC","Case Number":"20408","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around November 9th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.988096"}
