We then noticed directly overhead a fast moving \"star\" going across the sky.it seemed to fly toward the north east. It was moving VERY fast. We first thought, could it be a satellite? The space station? We watched it disappear behind some clouds. We then went to the front yard and my boyfriend grabbed his pointer laser from in the house. We looked for it again where we thought it might be coming out from the cloud. Then all of a sudden we saw another super bright VERY VERY fast moving \"star\" like light appear overhead and this one was moving north to south. It even seemed to change its direction of path as we watched it in awe. He shined his laser pointer on it in the sky and after a few seconds of having the laser on it, it completely disappeared from our sight. It didn't move behind a cloud like the first one, it just vanished. Whatever those bright, incredibly fast moving objects were, it was definitely not a star."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48406.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48406.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-155.573912","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.905446,+-155.573912(48406)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48406) map </A>","trends":[],"Case Number":"48406","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
