{"divs":["sighting detailsat 9.20 ish pm(gmt) i went outside to find something in 1.my car, and then 2.across the street to my mother'car (if i found nothing in my car!).i was reaching in my car and a bright light moving caught my attention. i saw what i feel was the same object on friday eve and then it passed over at the average height of a plane (the same as sat night-but at slightly earlier time i am quite sure). on fri night what i saw i kind of said 'nah' to myself, although this was silent it did seem to waver\\veer slightly left in it path. moved like a plane-glided- in air but was silent. it kind of headed e(ast)e(east)n(orth) friday(towards germany?) but this eve it was going due east. i guess it got almost above chepstow (or 4 miles away tops - maybe within 10,000feet?) i think much less than 10,000 feet - but i am not too clued up on objects and altitude. i was watching unsuredly at this point.within 10-15 seconds this thing moved off kind of ees direction at what seems 30-40 degrees. it did get smaller and within 5-10 secs got slightly light orange. it left sight!simple as. location - i believe the object was possible above the severn estuary\\bristol channel- this i believe is as far south as it could be. more likely above a line that would run in between the estuary\\coastline and the m4 motorway. it was definately on an east bearing. probably took off approx 1mile west - sw of the town of chepstow. the object would have covered about 2 miles in a contant direction -(that i observed anyway). possibly 5-10 seconds after i affirmed with myself i was watching something unusual - i.e.as far as i could tell there was no structure(wings or rotor blades,etc) jutting off the object. i realised the light didn't seem to be focused in any one direction - it just emanated out --- well after the 5-10 secs the object moved away about 30-40 degrees upward and at a more southeasteast direction. it was gone within prob 8 secs. i watched it dissapear in a constant direction."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"10175","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"GB-04062008-0003","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-2.997664","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10175.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10175.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10175.html"],"City":"Newport","Region":"Wales","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.584151,+-2.997664(10175)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10175) map </A>","Date of the Event":"04/05/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"09:18:00","Date Submitted":"04/05/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Newport","There were no other sightings in Newport on or around April 5th 2008"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United Kingdom","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Observed Star-like light move across sky (<200mph?).Then leave atmosphere @ approx 30degrees.","Latitude":"51.584151"}
