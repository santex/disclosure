{"Latitude":"32.716999","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I was driving towards Jamul on the Old 94 or Campo Rd I noticed a flying object out the drivers seat window. The object was zig zaging and moving unlike anything I seen before. Sparks were falling from the object and i thought is was a missle, an air plane possibly crashing, or Rudolph the red nose raindeer(i almost crashed watching this this thing). I stopped at the Jamul general store. Along with several bystanders, we all watched this amazing light. At this point I noticed there were two flying objects. The one that was sparking actually exploded. I heard the explosion as well as saw the bright light. The second object hoovered over us an seemed as it was flying down over out heads at a super fast speed. I actually jumped out the way i thought it was going to hit us. It just stayed over us for a while then in a matter of about 5-10 seconds, it looked like it flew into outter space. It was crazy. This was not something of this world. I believen in aliens and firmly believe this was a space craft."],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"9747","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"12/24/2007 10:00 UTC","Summary":"Bright Red Light","City":"Jamul","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"12/24/2007 10:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-02282008-0007","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9747.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9747.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Jamul","There were no other sightings in Jamul on or around December 24th 2007"],"Longitude":"-116.876135","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.716999,+-116.876135(9747)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9747) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like"}
