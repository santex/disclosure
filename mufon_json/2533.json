My apartment is on the top floor of thebuilding. I noticed a bright flash like an electric charge. When I turned tolook out the window I saw an oval object that appeared to be like ice. It wasearly morning in winter in South Africa so the sun was still quite low. I ranonto the landing and saw the object disappear behind the other buildings in thearea. At the time I felt light headed and dazed. I was aware that what I saw wasnot usual, however I first thought it was a helicopter, but then that was only abrief thought. The flash of blue light made me look out the window. Before thatI had been at the washbasin facing the wall.I have not reported or spoken to anyone about this incident. Shortly after thisI was institutionalised for severe depression and aggression. I don92t know if what I saw affected me. I was at the time an officer in the SouthAfrican Military. I have never been prone to believing in Para normal orextraterrestrial activities."],"Case Number":"2533"}
