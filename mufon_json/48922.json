We taped them while driving","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at home when i first noticed the object. It was a dim light in the sky and as i watched it, It started to glow brighter then dim out off and on. At first i thought it was a plane until it started brightnening and dimming. After a while it started slowly moving to the left afterhivering for about 30 minutes. So we jumped in the car and drove towards it and as we gotcloser to its general location we were able to get a better shot of it. We were shocked at what we saw. We lost sight from the obstructions such as buildings, trees, and a hill."],"Source":"MUFON"}
