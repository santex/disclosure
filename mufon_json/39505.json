Only later did we notice what appears to be very bright two light orbs with halos and one smaller spherical object above them. I thought maybe the lights were from a plane, although they seem way too bright against a sunset sky to be plane headlights, and the small orb above and slightly to the left appears almost perfectly spherical and doesn't look like a plane at all, to me. Any information on what the researchers here think these objects might be would be welcome."],"Longitude":"-79.357504","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.680549,+-79.357504(39505)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39505) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"saw on image after photo was taken","City":"Toronto","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-06192012-0008","Region":"Ontario","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around June 7th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/07/2012 08:33 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.680549","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39505.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/39505_submitter_file1__DSC0427.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39505.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"39505","Country":"Canada"}
