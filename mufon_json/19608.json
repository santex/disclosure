{"Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-90.512814","divs":["Sighting DetailsA totally huge (like the size of several aircraft-carriers) black isoceles triangle totally silent lit on the apex of the angles of the triangle with only yellowish-white lights flew over us at about what appeared to be maybe 1500 foot off the deck. I could see the mechanical structure of the underside of the triangle from the ambient lights of the city at night. This thing was HUGE and made not one sound... it went slowly over us (wife and I both saw this simultaneously) headed East. It went perhaps a half-mile East very slowly and then banked to the left (North) and accelerated to an incredible speed and disappeared into the night. This was NOT a T3-B craft or whatever the military has told us (Aurora thing)... NO... this was something not from here. It was totally anti-gravity. I called the city police and filed a police report; police came out and took the info. This thing was INCREDIBLE. Both me and my wife were left totally dumbfounded... neither of us had seen anything like this ever before or since. No pix or vids... it happened to fast and unexpectedly."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19608.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19608.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.51448,+-90.512814(19608)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19608) map </A>","Summary":"Huge Totally Silent Black Isoceles Triange Starship-like Craft","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Moline","There was one other sighting in Moline on or around October 20th 2005"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"19608","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Moline","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/23/2009 07:34 UTC","Latitude":"41.51448","Date of the Event":"10/20/2005 10:20 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09232009-0017","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States"}
