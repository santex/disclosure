I though it was a Firefly, but it was moving very fast, and was very far. Immediatly we saw another one, with the same characteristics. From 4 Pm to 4:15 Pm, we have seen 6 UFO. Then there was no activity. But it reappears at 4:40 Pm, and we saw others 4 UFO, until 5 Pm, because the sun started to rise. The object moved straight to the horizon, with some little variations and direction changes. I was fascinated watching the speed of these UFOs. I lost the sight in the horizon, and seems like the object were fading off."],"Region":"Misiones","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"12/14/2012 04:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-27.38973,+-55.903248(44538)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44538) map </A>","Log Number":"AR-12142012-0002","Latitude":"-27.38973","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
