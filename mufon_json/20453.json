On February 10, 2009, I had an incredible sighting at a range closer than anything I can find in many UFO chronicles across the web. At about 6:15-6:20 on February 10, 2009, I saw a large circular object floating above Highway 16 on the west side of Charlotte, NC. I was driving toward Huntersville when I saw the grayish object floating right above the trees. It was kind of shaped like a flat disk or acorn, and was floating above the trees on the right of the highway. The object appeared to be between 50 to 100 feet in diameter and no more than 10 or 20 feet tall. I first noticed the object about 200 yards ahead of me, and I could not see the entire circumference, yet it was a circular object suspended in mid-air. As it was I became immensely curious as to what was keeping it suspended. When I approached the object I realized that it was hovering without suspension partially over the highway and the trees on the right side of the road. From a distance it seemed to be shrouded in shadows at the very end of dusk when the sun is on the horizon. As I approached I could see in clear detail four lights all on opposite sides in a sort of perfect X-formation on the bottom of the object along with hollow hole in the center of the bottom of the saucer. The skin of the object seemed to be made of a grayish metal with clear, straight seams in a seemingly symmetrical pattern. Across the bottom of the object there seemed to be markings that looked almost hieroglyphic in nature. In the center of the object there was an empty black hole like there was a middle cylinder removed from the structure. The method of flight of the object seemed to be something completely out of this world, yet since I was on the ground and could not clearly see the top of the object, I could not tell if it had any sort of propeller keeping it adrift in mid-air, yet from every angle that I had a visual I did not see anything that would explain its method of flight. The skin almost reminded me of a smooth pewter with a pattern that was grid-like with the hieroglyphic symbols in each cell. From the distance I was it seemed to be texture on the outer surface but I could faintly make out markings in the pattern, but I had no idea what they meant. This simple fact - that the object was simply floating a few feet above the trees on the right of the road interested me most, When I realized that the object was beyond the human capacity of technological development, I remember feeling a sudden fear that I should not be witnessing what I was seeing. When I passed under the object for a brief moment, I remember passing almost directly under one of the light fixtures which I remember seeing with clear detail. It seemed to emit an intense cone of light similar to those that illuminate night construction on highways, if not brighter. The light seemed to be held onto the object on two sides by small V-like metal structures, and the light itself could not have been larger than one of our manufactured 100 watt generic bulbs, yet it burned with great intensity. The center hole of the object was most peculiar because it seemed to ascend into the object into a total blackness which my eyes couldn���t penetrate. The hole, from what I could tell, probably took up about 10-20% of the base surface area and was in the exact center of the object. When I passed under the object I remember nothing but fear and curiosity in the object. I must have been going close to 100 mph when I was passing under it to get out of its way, and the only thought of stopping for a picture was thwarted with my fears of abduction. I still to this day pass by the very curve on Highway 16, and remember the sighting every time I drive that route."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/11/2009 12:48 UTC","Longitude":"-80.842107","Summary":"Passed under a clearly not man-made object in the air back in February","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Case Number":"20453","City":"Charlotte","Latitude":"35.231717","Log Number":"US-11112009-0001","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Charlotte on or around February 10th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"02/10/2009 06:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.231717,+-80.842107(20453)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20453) map </A>","Region":"North Carolina"}
