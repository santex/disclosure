I looked out the window as I walked down the hall and I noticed a strange pulsating blue and red lights. I wondered if it were a star or satellite so I stopped and stared. The lights were in an arc shape and they hovered. I watched for a long time because I could not believe what I was seeing. I kept trying to rule out possible answers other than UFO. After a while the lights moved quickly in a zig zag pattern and disappeared. I could not longer see the lights because of trees."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Avon","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.80962","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33966.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33966.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.830515","Date of the Event":"12/11/2011 04:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/11/2011 07:39 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Connecticut","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-12112011-0011","Case Number":"33966","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.80962,+-72.830515(33966)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33966) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
