He noticed the object first, then nudged me. The light was far brighter and larger than a plane or helicopter. I saw the light flash for just a second or two, and then the light stopped, revealing a grayish blue (just a shade darker than the sky) disc-like object. The disc shape hovered for a few seconds before going down into a group of clouds, where it changed color to match the clouds. From there, it travelled in a downward diagonal direction. We decided to drive to the shore to get a better look, and in doing that we lost sight of the disc."],"Log Number":"US-11082010-0024","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Holland","There were no other sightings in Holland on or around November 7th 2010"],"Summary":"bright blinking light that went away to reveal the shape of a stereotypical flying saucer","Longitude":"-86.10621"}
