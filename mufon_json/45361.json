I came to a stop and pulled over, perplexed by this strange glowing object. It was flying SW over the houses and trees at a speed that was slightly faster than commercial airplanes. I originally thought it was a planet, but planets do not move that quickly. It was pulsating these lights that appeared to go from orange to yellow in no specific pattern. I continued driving down the road another half mile to my destination, where I again pulled over. The UFO was getting farther away from me, when it suddenly switched directions and begin flying straight upwards a little more slowly. I ran to get my mother to come outside and see it, which only took five seconds maximum. When I looked up, the object was gone and there were only some stars left in the sky."]}
