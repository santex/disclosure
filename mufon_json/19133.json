12:19 pm i was just sitting on my front deck talking on the phone to my sister as i sometimes do during the day, smoking a cigarette and minding my own business (more or less...lol), when i saw the craziest thing i've ever seen. first of all, let me say this, i live not far from charlotte, perhaps 15 miles from charlotte airport as the crow flies, so i often take a break and sit out here watching planes flying to and from the airport. that's normal and a usual routine for me. because i was talking on the phone and otherwise distracted, i wasn't paying attention to planes or anything else. the sky is particularly blue and clear other than a few puffy clouds here and there, but something flashing in the sky (like a mirror reflecting) caught my eye as i was talking to my sister. i inadvertently watched the object, thinking it to be an airliner headed towards charlotte. there was something odd about it, though, because even though it was long and silver shaped, i couldn't see any wings on it, but it was definitely flashing as if it were rotating in flight and reflecting the sunlight (like a cigar spinning). i stopped talking to her for a moment, watched the object (which was large and very visible), when it suddenly disappeared as if it just faded out of view. i was stumped and completely lost my train of thought. i interrupted my sister and told her what i had seen and was describing it to her, and about three or four seconds after it \"disappeared\", there was a flash of silver streak as it reappeared and zoomed back in the opposite direction, 180 degrees from the direction it had been traveling. this thing went completely out of site within a split second. that's the part that floored me more than anything else. again, speechless, i stumbled for words and finally told her it had just reappeared and had zoomed out of site the opposite direction. within five minutes a military awaks type of aircraft (the ones with what looks like a large satellite dish on their back) came from the direction of charlotte and flew to the same area which i had seen the... thing... disappear. in comparison, this thing i saw was at least three times larger than the awaks plane and it had no wings whatsoever, just a long cylinder shape. anyways, i had to tell somebody, and you can laugh if you want to, i would if it were me reading it instead of having just seen it happen. ________________________________ here is the link showing the timestamp: http:\\\\www.panthersfanz.com\\forums\\index.php?showtopic=14438&st=0 ___________________________________ as far as my feelings or reaction, i was stumped, dazed, and was a little shocked that this had happened to me in broad daylight. as my post stated, what originally brought the object to my attention was flashes coming from it, appearing as if the sun was reflecting off a mirror or something. as i looked towards it, i first thought it was a very large airplane, but immediately noticed the revolving or rotational movement of it. my first thought, for a split second, was that it was a plane in trouble and that it was going to crash (due to the rotation of it), but as it rotated, i realized there were no wings on the object. as funny as this sounds, i was about to consider it to be a blimp (even though it was traveling too fast), when it literally faded from blue into the clear blue sky. the reason i say \"faded\" is because that is exactly as it appeared. it took approximately 1 - 2 seconds for it to fade from view, but it did not \"instantly\" disappear. i blurted out something, interrupting my sister's phone conversation, and told her what i had just seen. about three to four seconds later, before she could finish making a joke about it, the object reappeared and in a flash it zipped out of site 180 degrees in the opposite direction. nothing \"we\" have could fly as fast as that thing flew. there was no sound involved, although when it reappeared and flew in the opposite direction it left a sort of short trail from where it originated. it was not like a cloud trail, but more of a vapor or heat trail, which quickly faded from view. all that said, i can promise you as a grown man (and owner of that nfl fan site), i would never have made such a post and risk ridicule had it not affected me so much and had it not happened. thanks for listening. dewayne gore"],"Date of the Event":"07/16/2008 11:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.229427,+-80.839567(19133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19133) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19133.html"],"Region":"North Carolina","City":"Charlotte","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/08/2009 11:01 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
