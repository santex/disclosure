{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-84.396115","Country":"United States","Summary":"I witness 2 UFOs outside of my apartment for over 3 hours.","Latitude":"42.753289","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn March 2nd 2009 at approximately 11:09pm, my girlfriend and I witnessed two UFOs hovering outside of my apartment.They bounced around in the night sky until about 3:00am on March 3, 2009. These UFOs were very high in altitude, so they resembled stars, but they were flashing red, white and blue lights. At one point an airplane flew over my apartment and it amazed me, because I could see the contrast of altitudes. The plane was probably a few hundred feet up, but the UFOs seemed to be easily five times that height! This was the fourth time that I have witnessed these UFOs outside of my apartment. I submitted a report to MUFON about the first time, which took place on the earl morning of February 23rd 2009. I also seen them on the night of February 23rd and the early morning of February 27th. I know that these UFOs were not stars, satellites, or conventional aircraft due to their strange flight pattern. These UFOs moved and bounce up and down, side to side, diagonally, in ���L���shaped curves, circles and figure eights. They performed these maneuvers every few seconds over the course of hours. I had felt emotions ranging from awe and elation to fear and worry about what I have seen outside of my apartment. My basic feeling is joy, because I think that I am blessed to be able to watch these UFOs perform their amazing maneuvers from my apartment. My girlfriend and I were watching videos on YouTube and I was curious to see if they were out there. After observing them for over 3 hours, I lost the first one, because it went over my apartment. With the second, I just went to bed, because it was a little after 3:00am."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.753289,+-84.396115(15812)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15812) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/03/2009 11:10 UTC","Log Number":"US-03032009-0009","Date of the Event":"03/03/2009 11:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15812.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","City":"Meridian Charter Township","Region":"Michigan","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Meridian Charter Township","There were no other sightings in Meridian Charter Township on or around March 3rd 2009"],"Case Number":"15812"}
