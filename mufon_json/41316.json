The strange thing is the object, again probably a satelite, lit up 3 times from being so dim that I could hardly see it, to a reddish orange color and was very visible. Traveled in a staight line just like a satelite and about the same distance as one. No clouds and yes I have seen them disappear from the lack of sunlight, not the case. Strange, 3 mins and lit up 3 times in an odd color. That's it, not a major sighting, good reading and who knows?
