The encounter started after the kids had gone into the camper trailer to get ready for bed while my brother and I picked up the camp site. As my brother was burning some trash in the fire, I walked over the hood of the truck and gazed off into the clear, star-filled cloudless night to see if I could observe some more satellites that we had shown the kids approximately 30 minutes earlier. As I was looking off to the western sky, with Mount Katahdin and Millinocket Lake to my right I observed what I first thought to be a jet steadily flying towards the east at an extremely high altitude. After watching it for a moment I quickly dismissed the thought that it was a jet due to its��� fast rate of travel across the sky and yet conversely dismissed it as being a satellite due its��� slow rate of travel. Essentially what I witnessed was traveling faster and higher than a commercial jet but slower and lower than the satellites that we had observed earlier in the evening with the kids. I continued to watch for another minute thinking to myself that this light or object must be a couple hundred miles or further away from my present location. As I watched it moving steadily across the sky it stopped! It Stopped!! I had to blink my eyes because I thought that I was seeing things. But sure enough the bright object had just stopped and then just when I got my brain around that fact the object accelerated straight down in the blink of an eye in what I would estimate to be 5 ��� 10 miles judging from its��� distance. As soon as it reached a lower altitude it immediately changed direction and shot diagonally (make a V) up to what appeared to be its��� original elevation in about two (2) seconds and continued on its easterly cruise at a speed relative to the speed before it stopped and dropped. My jaw hit the hood of the truck and I stammered for my brother to come over to where I was. I said man you gotta see this! Right after I called out to my brother it performed the same exact maneuver again, stopped, dropped 5-10 miles and then shot back up at an angle to the original altitude all in a matter of 5 seconds. AMAZING!! My brother came over to my side and I pointed out the object in the sky to him and told him to watch. Again, the same maneuver was executed. We were both dumb struck. In my mind and our opinion this was no plane, nor tele-communications satellite, nor space station, nor swamp gas, nor car headlight reflecting off the swamp gas. This was a high speed vehicle (lets use the term UFO) performing some amazing maneuvers in the Northern Maine July Sky. Awesome! This activity continued for a couple more maneuvers (think W shaped) and then the object which, although getting closer to yet still many miles away from decided to maintain a steady course with a slight incline towards our left. In other words the object appeared to be heading towards us yet turning towards outerspace. We continued to watch this object (white light) for approximately 25-30 minutes as it seemingly flew straight out into space and disappeared. The entire show lasted for approximately 30 minutes.
