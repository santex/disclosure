{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting Details On May 18, 2001, I was on the back deck with a friend at 7:50 PM. The contrast of the green leaves against the blue sky was quite beautiful. I noticed an unusually bright star that was visible even though the sun was still up. The light wasnt moving and I was able to point it out to my friend. Observing with the binoculars the light was too large to be a star. I got my telescope and looked at the light almost directly overhead and saw a round blue white object. It was whiter around the edge and darker in the middle, giving the impression of a translucent soap bubble. I observed it for about 10 seconds in the scope after focusing. It did not appear to move, but suddenly it flew very quickly out of the scopes field of view (may have bumped scope). It was not a satellite because they move too fast, nor a plane because those move and theyre not round. It wasnt a star or a balloon because it was stationary for too long and later moved too fast."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Thru telescope saw a round blue white object. bubb","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.74179,+-92.84535(1201)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1201) map </A>","Region":"Minnesota","Date Submitted":"05/18/2001 07:50 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hastings","There were no other sightings in Hastings on or around May 18th 2001"],"Case Number":"1201","Date of the Event":"05/18/2001 07:50 UTC","Latitude":"44.74179","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1201.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1201.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","City":"Hastings","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"","Longitude":"-92.84535"}
