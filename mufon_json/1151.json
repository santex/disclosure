When person #1 said what is that in the sky? We all looked to see atriangular shaped object glide overhead. It was not moving very fast, it seemedto be in no great hurry. It had 5 lights on its underside along each wing. Theobject was very big and very high. It flew above the sirus clouds. It was flyingfrom north to south and as we quietly watched it fly overus it then passedbehind a tree and into a cloud. We walked out further into the lot to watch itemerge from the cloud on the other side and it never did. It just disappeared. Ithought maybe it was the stealth but it was shaped like a perfect triangle andit did not make a sound. No engine sound or anything. I am nothing other thanamazed and I am wondering what exactly did I see. Was it a UFO or just thegovernment at work????"],"Country":"United States","Region":"California","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1151.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1151.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1151.html"],"City":"Pasadena"}
