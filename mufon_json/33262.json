Noticed orb in the sky almost immediately after I sat down. Called my wife outside but she was uninterested. I was excited because I was sure it wasn't a plane or helicopter. Took four 30 sec - 1 min vids on my cell phone as it quickly became dark outside. Partly cloudy day with no wind, so the clouds were stationary. Watched \"orb\" move very slowly in the sky and at times it was stationary[parked behind cloud]. Eventually it moved below the horizon."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Wilkes-Barre","There were no other sightings in Wilkes-Barre on or around November 3rd 2011"],"City":"Wilkes-Barre","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/10/2011 08:43 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11102011-0014","Date of the Event":"11/03/2011 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Moved to slowly to be a plane and at times was stationary, eventually descended out of view","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.254845,+-75.872228(33262)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33262) map </A>","Latitude":"41.254845","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.872228","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"33262"}
