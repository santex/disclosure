I watched them for 4 hours last night and they captured the famous Phoenix Lights again. Out of the 5 different Webcams available only Two areas were of interest. Camelback Mountain and South Mountain. In both of these Webcams many UFOs were recorded and seen. I will start with the Camelback Webcam High Res Shots. These first three showed the craft showing up and I believe they are single ships not one large one. The reason is they break off and fly down near the the Mountains and it the pictures to follow you will see what I'm taking about. These are great locations to view the sky and capture the craft. If someone could get Web Cams up with continous feeds in these areas we would see some fantastic UFO Video. More Photos to follow.
