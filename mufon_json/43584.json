Walked out my front door as I do multiple times each night to look for objects. Noticed a jet directly overhead, and then noticed an orb behind it. Then another orb being followed by a jet. The first orb followed the leading jet heading south until both flew out of site. Second orb changed direction 180 degrees now heading north jet made sharp turn to pursue orb but by the time the jet completed the 180 degree turn the orb was half way across the horizon and continued heading north until out of site. Both orbs were white and star sized. I turned back to the south and observed a meteor looking object that came in to the atmosphere directly over my head decending from the wsw to the ene. Object was a fireball about a half inch wide leaving an 8 - 10 inch trail of sparks and flames."]}
