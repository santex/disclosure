{"Longitude":"-80.247622","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were out in the driveway at roughly 10:40pm, having a cigarette. It was warm and humid, and there was farily thick but broken cloud coverage. There was very little air movement or breeze. We were both looking at the sky, as that is what we normally do while out smoking. I was looking in one direction,(southeast) and my husband was looking in another (north), when my husband shouted \"look!\" and pointed to the sky. I turned quickly and immediately saw what he was pointing at. We witnessed an object flying well underneath the clouds, though neither my husband or I are able to give even a rough altitude. Although it appeared as though it might have been at a rough altitude of where private small propellor planes often fly, while circling to land at the near-by air strip. The object was grey or light grey against the cloudy background. It had no lights or reflectors of any kind, and we were also unable to determine exactly what kind of shape the object was. My husband, who saw the object a few seconds longer than me, says that at least the back-side of the object was almost rectangular in shape. I was unable to decide on any shape, personally, though it was clearly a solid shape. It was moving in a northwest direction at a very quick speed, but was moving perfectly smooth and steady in a very straight line. If I were to compare the speed of the object we saw to the speed of an aircraft, it would be similiar to the speed of a fighter jet, (i.e. F-15, not 737.) We witnessed the object only for a few seconds, and then lost sight of it past our neighbor's roof. Guelph, Ontario, is roughly 75km from Toronto, which has a large airport. Guelph also has it's own very small air strip. Due to this we see alot of activitiy in the air on a daily basis. (Also, I grew up in Duluth Minnesota, where there is an airport and Air Force base, so I have spent my entire life seeing aircraft of all sorts in the skies.) My husband and I do not feel what we saw last night was a plane or jet of any kind. I felt 100% certain of that even while I was looking at the object in the sky. No lights, or distinct airplane shape (wings) and the biggest, no sound. Guelph also has quite a few industrial buildings, so there is continuous background noise, however it was very quiet last night due to it being a Sunday, and the near-by plants do not run on the weekends. Even with the normal industrial hum always in the background, we are able to hear passenger planes high above the clouds coming and going from the Toronto airport, and often have small private planes flying over our house coming to and from the small air strip just outside of town. So, this object we witnessed last night being completely silent really sticks out in our minds. We also do not believe the object was a bird of any kind. Birds flying have distinct characteristics, such as gliding with or against the wind, flapping wings, and variations in speed. The object we saw did not have any of those characteristics, as it moved with one, quick, speed and remained in a perfectly straight and smooth line for the entire duration of our witnessing it. I have been interested in the UFO phenomena for some time, (which is why I always keep my eyes to the sky when I'm outside), and have never seen anything unexplainable, until last night. My husband has never seen anything unexplainable either, though he does not generally look as much as I do, until last night. I never really put alot of thought into how I would react in the case I actually did see what I was looking for. I could not tell you what my initial thoughts were, but it did make my heart skip a beat, and interestingly brought a tear to my eye. My husband was not quite as \"touched\", as his first thoughts were \"wow, a ufo\"."],"Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.539102,+-80.247622(11666)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11666) map </A>","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Guelph","There were no other sightings in Guelph on or around July 20th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"07/20/2008 10:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/20/2008 10:40 UTC","City":"Guelph","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Cigar, Egg, Square, Rectagular, Teardrop, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11666.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11666.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Grey object, moving quickly, silently, and smoothly, no lights or reflectors,","Latitude":"43.539102","Region":"Ontario","Log Number":"CA-07212008-0011","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"11666","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Other, Unknown"}
