(which you see on the video) i want to point out that prior to this, about 1 month before this event i had prayed to god to please let me see him, and about 2 weeks later i the first experience in these series of episodes. my husband was sleeping in the bedroom, the lights and tv were off and i had just laid down. i looked up at the ceiling and there was a 5 inch glowing orb on my ceiling, i couldn't believe what i was seeing. (it looked the the one you see in the video but bigger) i looked around the room to see to see if it was a reflection coming from somewhere. it was pitch black in the room and no explanation for it. i woke my husband up because i thought i was seeing things. he turned around half asleep and said he saw it to. honestly this was very unnerving, i put the covers over my head and fell asleep. 2 weeks later is when i had the flashing triangle episode. about a week after the triangle episode about 5:00am in the morning i was looking out my back window because i heard some noise coming from the business strip in the back of our parking lot(see pic). i opened the window and noticed a truck in the business strip which i assumed was the noise i was hearing. out of nowhere i see what looks like a comet with a flame going perfectly horizontal 100 feet above my parking lot. i was shocked because it did not come down vertically from the sky. it was perfectly horizontal like someone shot it through a cannon. it was a very big size and very bright. i can't explain what i saw. i saw a video on youtube of a flaming comet that was coming down from the sky, but was traveling one way then would change directions, then change directions again. it was a amazing video and not a comet as it appeared to be because of the erratic changes in direction. i saw a posting today on mufon dec 12th 2008 from someone that had a similar experience withe glowing orbs in his house. i know in the kabbalah, ancient egyptian esoteric sun worship, astrology and gnostic circles this event may be seen as a good omen, being that the up side triangle represent fire and the downward triangle water, the male and female principle and a sign of enlightenment, but after listening to tom horn, steve quayle, david flynn and joye pugh i have came to believe that maybe it is something more sinister, maybe a deception. i am not sure but the more i have learned about what is happening in the world the more frightened i become. i was baptized catholic have been a new ager for most of my life until now. something very strange is happening in the world today and i believe we are on the cusp of something very unbelievable that is going to happen. the fact that there are governmental groups worshiping lucifer as the bearer of light and erecting pagen statues has made me run back to my christian roots. if there is lucifer then there is jesus. ufos are in the bible as well as stargates worm holes and inter dimensional beings, fallen angels and nephelim. research tom horn, steve quayle, david flynn and joyce pugh. i know it's clearly states in the bible that a falling away would occur and a great deception will spread the world over and even the elect will be deceived i am in a state of confusion as to it's meaning. my esoteric knowledge says good. my faith say's bad. your thoughts are much appreciated....but before you comment please research those researchers i have listed above. i listed on mufon message board you can post a reply on the message board"],"Case Number":"14380","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/25/2008 05:30 UTC","Longitude":"-87.626588","Region":"Illinois","Summary":"Video of orb and flashing multicolor triangles in bedroom.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.886494,+-87.626588(14380)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14380) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.886494","Date Submitted":"09/25/2008 05:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14380.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14380_submitter_file1__Wall.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14380_submitter_file3__Picture295.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14380.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere, Triangle","Log Number":"US-12122008-0007"}
