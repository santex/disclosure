Passing through the west side of Seguin on Texas 46 just north of US 90 sometime between 8:33 and 8:40. I was looking at the crescent moon lined up with Jupiter and Venus when I noticed what I thought were tail lights reflecting on my windshield. I noticed that the shape was odd though. I pulled over, rolled down the window and the lights were still there in the sky. There were 3 red lights in a triangle formation with a 4th light off to the left of the group of 3. The lights were solid for the most part (not blinking), but one did fade. They hovered for about 15 seconds. I pulled out my camera and managed to get one picture. They started to move away to the north. I started to follow them but they suddenly disappeared. I was wondering if the lights could be helicopters, but there was no sound of helicopters, just cars."],"City":"Seguin","Case Number":"36745","Latitude":"29.575056","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"03/26/2012 12:35 UTC","Longitude":"-97.989887","Date of the Event":"03/25/2012 08:33 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36745.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/36745_submitter_file1___MG_9930.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36745.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Seguin","There was one other sighting in Seguin on or around March 25th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-03262012-0001","Summary":"3 solid red lights hovered then moved and disappeared","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
