Observed what I thought was an airplane flying towards my house. I asked my spouse if we lived near an airport. She said no. I told her to come see this airplane flying towards the house. She sat on the couch watching TV and wouldn't come, so I told her that if it wasn't an airplane then it must be a UFO. She got up to come and see what I was talking about. The objects just sat there in the sky. Then the objects separated and one shot off heading north and then disappeared. She told me to grab the camara, and when I went for the camara and made it back, the other object sat there for a while and then just disappeared. The picture I am submitting isn't good, because by the time I got the camara ready, the object was disappearing. It is not the bright light, but to the left of the street light is the object as it was disappearing."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12946.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12946_submitter_file1__10_07_2008.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12946.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/07/2008 09:05 UTC","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"10/07/2008 09:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","City":"Forest Hill","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Oval, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Windy","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"2 UFOs hovered above neighborhood","Log Number":"US-10072008-0009","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.672078","Case Number":"12946","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.672078,+-97.269181(12946)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12946) map </A>","Longitude":"-97.269181"}
