The location closest to where they fly over every night is in Crete Il (america) and there is a road called Old Post Road by Plum Valley subdivision. You will see them around there. there is also haunted woods off of old post road (axemans bridge), im not sure if there is any connection. I was in my room looking out my window last night, and i saw 3 of them last night. They flew a variation of fast and slow but they stayed in the same area almost the whole night. I wasnt any sort of emotion, this happens every night and i just decided to report it."],"City":"Crete"}
