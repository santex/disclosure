It appeared high up and i thought it was a plane as i am in the landing pattern for one of the Chicago airports. I spotted it with the binoculars and noticed it was brighter then normal landing lights. As it got closer i noticed it was above the normal landing high and the light was much brighter then normal. As it flew directly over head you tell the light surrounded the object and it was not a commercial aircraft. It continued on its path to the NE until it was out of sight."],"Date Submitted":"07/09/2009 09:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Plainfield","There were no other sightings in Plainfield on or around July 9th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/09/2009 09:25 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.623515,+-88.202179(17988)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17988) map </A>","Case Number":"17988","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"very bright light traveling slowley NE","Log Number":"US-07092009-0024","Region":"Illinois","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.623515"}
