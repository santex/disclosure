Ran 2 the front of the house and it's there. A bright planet looking star moving horizontally across the sky towards a stationary star. Watched it for about a minute. Heard a neighbor outside, turned 2 call them down and then it was just gone. There are no trees it could've disappeared behind. My daughter saw it. This was after we saw what could've been another ufo, I am posting that event as well, and am keeping my eyes towards the sky.
