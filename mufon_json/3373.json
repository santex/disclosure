I ve never reported anything before.This is my first time seeing and reporting.I just had to tell someone and you guys were my best bet."],"Log Number":"","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"3373","Summary":"Bright Orange-Reddish Light, also a Green second one"}
