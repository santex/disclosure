{"Longitude":"-72.852048","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07062010-0022","Region":"New York","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was July 4th 2010 in Long Island, about 2 miles north of the south shore. My girlfriend, mother and myself were sitting on the back deck near the pool watching the sky for fireworks. Around 10:35pm I noticed a star that looked like it was moving. I asked the 2 of them if they could also see it, they did and after we all had our eyes on the moving star it turned left 90 degrees and then vanished. in our perspective. We commented and joked to each other that stars are not supposed to move let alone change direction and then disappear! My mom went into the house to use the restroom leaving my girlfriend and I on the deck watching the sky. My girlfriend was the first to notice what happened next. In the southern sky, not far from us (judging by the trees all around the objects had to be less than 1 mile away) we saw an orange orb flying fairly low (much lower than any plane). With trees blocking the view of their entrance we saw the 1st orange orb fly from due west to east. Then another behind it. Then another behind that one, giving us 3 orange orbs flying in a line from west to east. Behind the 3rd orb was a small cluster of orbs, about 4 or 5 total. They never broke their formation. Behind the cluster of 4 or 5 orbs was another 3 flying in a line just like the first three. By the time the first of the orbs was visible my mom returned from the house. She heard us shouting and pointing at the orbs and she was able to also see them. They passed our field of vision and then they were gone. They looked like orange balls of light and emitted no sound. They were moving pretty fast and never broke their formation, with the 3 in line at the start, group of approximately 5 in the center and 3 more finishing the tail of the formation. We were all creeped out by the experience. We have never seen something like this before. We immediately knew this was not a firework of some sort, nor plane or helicopters. They were much too low for it to be a normally identifiable object. We remarked how they looked close enough where a rifle shot could have hit them. Just as quickly as they flew in to our view they were gone. The rest of the night we watched the sky and witnessed 3 more stars moving through the sky, change direction and disappear, however we did not see any more of the flying orange orbs."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.766766,+-72.852048(24271)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24271) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Mastic Beach","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.766766","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 11:11 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:40 UTC","Case Number":"24271","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"~12 orange orbs flying in formation.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mastic Beach","There were no other sightings in Mastic Beach on or around July 4th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24271.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24271.html"],"Country":"United States"}
