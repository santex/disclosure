At 10:14 pm I spot an object almost straight above me. It was moving North North West in direction. It had an orange glow. It was at about 9 to 10 thousand feet in altitude(AGL). It was silent moving at a moderate speed. As I watched it with binoculars it then dimmed a little and disappeared almost instantly. I spotted it in the sky near the star Vega. It disappeared just a little ways north of the star Vega. I have seen many such objects like this, some have even made 90 degree turns. It is too bad more people aren't more observant with what is going on in our skies."]}
