The lights were dim & evenly spaced one at the apex & 3 on each side, the triangle was only about 10 or 15 degrees, I do not know how high the clouds were the distance between the lights from side to side would be far wider the the wing span on the largest plane I have ever seen. I watched it for about 3 min,until it faded out. It was moving fairly slowly. I have always wondered if I was the only person to see this."],"Region":"Kansas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"21151","Log Number":"US-12262009-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21151.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21151.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
