Last night was Tuesday, Nov. 27. There were orange and white lights that got really bright then slowly dimmed. It hovered then moved slowly. We observed some kind of a plane miles to the East, probably coming from Selfridge air base. It was heading towards the object for about five minutes. By the time that the plane reached the ufo it dimmed down to nothing and vanished. This was the brightest that the object has ever gotten. I took 18 pictures. Of course it was so far away that the pictures are not that great."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.573313,+-82.979371(44196)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44196) map </A>","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-82.979371","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
