I DECIDED TO TAKE MY GRANDSON DOM TO THE PRACTICE SESSION OF THE AIR FORCE THUNDERBIRDS AT ATLANTIC CITY'S BOARDWALK. THE MAIN SHOW IS ON WEDNESDAY ON THE BEACH . I TOOK APROX 20 PICTURES WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA AND I CAUGHT AN IMAGE IN ONE OF THE PHOTOS. AFTER ENLARGING THE PICTURE TO THE MAX AMOUNT WITHOUT DISTORTION, THE OBJECT IS NOT A BIRD OR A PLANE. IT IS A VERY CLEAR IMAGE OF SOME KIND OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. THERE IS ANOTHER STRANGE OBJECT ON A FEW OF THE OTHER PICTURES BUT IT MAY BE A LENS FLAIR OR SOMETHING WITHIN THE CAMERA BUT I WILL CHECK IT OUT WITH A PROFESSIONAL PHOTO TECHNICIAN. OF COURSE I DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT WHEN I WAS TAKING THE PICTURES. AFTER DOWNLOADING THE PICTURES TO MY LAP TOP IS WHEN I MADE THE DISCOVERY."],"Case Number":"18741","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.372483,+-74.419567(18741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18741) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18741_submitter_file1__ACAIRSHOW8-18-09.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18741.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/18/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Wings, Other","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"New Jersey","Longitude":"-74.419567","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08182009-0019","Latitude":"39.372483","City":"Atlantic City","Summary":"DIGITAL CAMERA GOT IMAGE NEAR THE THUNDERBIRDS PRACTICE SESSION"}
