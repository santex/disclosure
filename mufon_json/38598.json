From my position they seemed to be just over the houses I think they may have been a half mile or more away one higher than the other. At first they seemed to be either slowly moving toward my location or slowly climbing up. They seemed to float there for a short time Thought at first they could be balloons with flares attached. The higher one would begin to go higher and the lower one would follow. they began to climb faster the highest one went straight up accelerating out of sight the lower one followed but continued to climb in a northerly direction I did not lose sight of the second one until it was overhead and to the north seemed to be at a very high altitude by this time and moving at a very hi rate of speed did not hear any sound."]}
