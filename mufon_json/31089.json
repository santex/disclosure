At approximately 6:15am, the moon (and what I believe is Mars) were still visisble in the night sky. And it was between those two brightest points, we saw a white-lighted disc traveling at a very high rate of speed--faster than what could be a satellite. The altitude was approximately 50,000 feet. We watched as the object fluttered out. As we were talking about this event, the same or different object reaappears. It flies in a oblong pattern, then flutters out. A few minutes later, either the same object just closer, or a bigger one altogether reappears out of thin air, stays in the same position then flutters out."]}
