Thought maybe balloon but balloons don't fly against the jet stream. I've seen lights at night around that seem not to belong, but to this day I see this in my minds eye. Took about thirty or so stills with my canon rebel no video cuz the card wouldn't handle it. But I don't know I wasn't gonna send these in because I'm still having a hard time when I think about it. Remember it's coming north up the valley towards Scranton then just stops goes west over close to public square."],"Case Number":"51552","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.212542,+-77.191815(51552)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51552) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/01/2013 08:01 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"41.212542"}
