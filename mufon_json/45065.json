Saw lights in sets of three. Initial thought was missiles. Came from the south horizon three object would move at a high rate of speed then hover. As they got higher they seemed to form a single file line. All eventually ended up overhead and they appeared to go into space. Never have any of us seen something like this. Much larger than plane or helicopter lights and moved faster than both. Really scared all involved as know other reports were made. We can't explain what it was but have several videos. Have more video not attached at this time."],"trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.972509,+-99.897693(45065)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45065) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45065.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45065.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Country":"United States"}
