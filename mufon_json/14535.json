My mother and father were out visiting in Hankinson ND, traveling back to Wahpeton ND, they told me a light very bright lit up an area around the car, stopping it. My mother wanted my father to get out of the car and look up, to see where the light was coming from. My father refused. the light went out and car started after a little while. they watched the object travel out of sight very slowly, with no sound. several officers of the law followed the lights. i believe they tracked the object from Hankinson ND to Fairmount ND to near Wahpeton ND. This story should be in the archives of the Daily News. I only know my father never told any one about the event which he thought would make people think they (my parents) were crazy. It's been so long since this event took place, I belive it was in the early 70's."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.265237,+-96.605907(14535)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14535) map </A>"}
