{"Tags":"City","Latitude":"30.400064","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i saw something very different in the sky on thanksgiving night about 6pm in destin florida while watching tv and surfing the net. a bright light that looked more like fire than a light, moving west to east slowly along the gulf coast. it was less than a 1\\4 mile away, only about 250 to 300 feet high, and made no noise. we watched from our southwest facing balcony on the gulf of mexico until it moved slowly behind some buildings and then up into the sky as if it were burning out. we were surprised when a second one came about 20 minutes later following the same path except when it began to move up it broke apart. the bottom half of the fire moved down to the gulf with some fire dripping from it and the top half rose up disappearing into the night sky as if it were burning out. we could not determine any noticeable shape or outline because it was dark. i did not have time to get my binoculars or video camera because i did not want to miss the brief event. but i did have both ready after the second sighting but no more were sighted the rest of the night. someone was shooting fireworks on the beach approximately one or two minutes after the second object which may have had something to do with our sighting. i believe in god. i also believe there may be other intelligence in the universe, but i am waiting for indisputable truth and proof. seeing is not believing. i don't believe shaky unfocused video, shadows in the night, or crop circles. come on now, this is a 2009 intelligent high tech society we live in with multitasking cell phones, digital cameras, high power telescopes, and listening devices that can hear an ant pissing on cotton. do you have some scientific, physical evidence, that i can feel, see, hear, touch, smell, and speak to? show me."],"Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"2 bright objects approximately 20 minutes apart slowly moving west to east and then upwards","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/26/2009 05:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20779.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20779.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.400064,+-86.494213(20779)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20779) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11282009-0014","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Destin","There were no other sightings in Destin on or around November 26th 2009"],"City":"Destin","Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-86.494213","Case Number":"20779","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/28/2009 09:22 UTC"}
