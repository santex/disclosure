I stepped out of the car to smoke a cigarette and heard strange sounds coming from all directions around the lake. It was a eery metallic sound, almost musical. I could hear it on one bank of the lake and then it was if there was a \"response\" from the other side of the lake. the sounds were different tones but all about the same loudness. I screamed for my boyfriend to get out of the car and listen to this! He did and was immediaely terrified. In addition to the strange sounds, there were no other usual \"night noises.\" In this part of the country we often here insects and other animals at night. This night it was completely silent. We began to get scared and jumped back in the car to get out of there fast. As we were driving down the road from the lake a huge disc-shaped object cleared the treetops and hovered above the car for a few moments. I swear to it. ���t this point, my boyfriend and I am terrified and I am crying and screaming. The disc took off at a speed I have never imagined and I have never been back to Lake Sherando again. I came home and immediately called my friends and family and didn't get any support. I am a 35 year old professional woman with 3 kids. I have never seen anything of this magnitude before in my life and have been unable to think about anything else since then."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05192008-0013","Region":"Virginia","City":"Sherando","Object Shape":"Disc","Latitude":"37.981249","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
