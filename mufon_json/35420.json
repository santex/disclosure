After a few seconds of observation i noticed it was an amber orb hovering in sky, after hovering for a few seconds the UFO started across the sky in a zig zag motion before stoping in the east and taking off again into night sky. I live next to an airport and can without a doubt say that it was no airplane, helicopter, satellite,or balloon. I can honestly say i have no idea what i witnessed, and as excited i was to have witnessed it my first emotional responce was fear. I did everything i could not to wake up eveyone in the house to verify it... perhaps i should have."],"Latitude":"40.808438","Log Number":"US-02022012-0017"}
