They also disappeared, then one reappeared further up and was ,oving extremely fast. Witnessed by three people. The most amazing thing is I took a picture of one of the lights in the distance, when I looked at the picture there was a very large circle object like an orb that came out in the picture. It was not there to the naked eye, and was very close. Multi colored orb....very very odd that it only showed up in the picture."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Unknown","Latitude":"43.201525","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
