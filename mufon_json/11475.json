It's hard to describe what I saw because I've never seen anything like it. I saw the exact same object 3 days earlier flying in the opposite direction at aproximately the same time. At the time of the sighting I was sitting in the back yard after ariving home from work. I noticed the object because of how bright it was. All of this was very confusing to the two of us because neither one of us had any idea of what we were looking at."],"Longitude":"-83.140144","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.216406,+-83.140144(11475)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11475) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/07/2008 11:50 UTC","Case Number":"11475","Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Wyandotte","There were no other sightings in Wyandotte on or around July 7th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"07/07/2008 11:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Slow moving object looked like a plain on fire.
