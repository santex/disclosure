I called my husband outside to witness this event with me. I live with roommates and do not have the key to the back gate and the lights went behind a tree where we could somewhat still see them as they continued their path SW. They came to the edge of the tree and then vanished. We could not see exactly where they went, but we could no longer see them through the tree."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47416.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47416.html"],"Log Number":"US-05142013-0011"}
