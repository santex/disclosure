As we got closer we noticed many black objects that looked like balls. At first I thought they were geese but they weren't in a v formation. There were far too many to be geese. We then noticed many small lights within each black orb. They were coming from the south heading northwest. About 6 of them on the right side started going higher just a little. We lost track of them when we took the 202 exit."],"Log Number":"US-03252013-0014","Longitude":"-74.2413","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.02789"}
