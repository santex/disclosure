I watched the planet Jupiter around 45 azimuth SE when I saw three small rounded objects with similar dimension ( angular ) of Jupiter, however less brighter and with orange color. I saw them during 5-10 seconds moving from W to E in a trajectory similar to a shooting star, however, there was not coma or trajectory traces. No noise happened. Suddenly one of them moved around the other (could be due to perspective view ) and them they disappear probable entering in the Sun shadow cone around 45 azimuth. The sky was clear in that point, despite of some clouds nearby. Could be a rest of some satellite or rocket, however, the movement around the other was strange for me."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Case Number":"19365","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.50985,+-73.544862(19365)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19365) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Montreal","Longitude":"-73.544862","Summary":"Three star-like objects moving over Montreal"}
