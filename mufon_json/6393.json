I am not sure this is worth your time. I have seen several reports of UFO's captured while filming movies--I have one to report as well. I was watching the movie \"The Big Lebowski(sp?)\" on TV last night and noticed a white circle flying to the left of John Goodman's head during the funeral scene at the end. I watched it several times and I could not figure out what this object was. I will try to post the scene or pics later. Thanks Joey Smith joeyp130@yahoo.com"]}
