Then it was gone and when it disappeared it made this womp kinda sound.I kept looking in the sky but I didn't see anything at first. Then I saw something zig zag across the sky.There were a lot of planes in the sky right after that more then what I usually see at one time but they don't shoot down beams of light and disappear with a noise. At first I was excited but then jt kind of made me nervouse. Dogs were barking and my cat ran inside the house and wouldn't come back out. Its still under the bed right now. I called my mom."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"grafton"}
