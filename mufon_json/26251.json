We were heading northeast on route 17. It was dusk like out....and while looking through the windshield......we saw an object that was hard to see its shape. But it was large and low. It was probably less than a thousand feet up. But what was so striking was that the object had a glowing green discharge coming out what would appear to be the back of the craft. It was going so slow that it didnt seem possible. Then it just kept moving across the sky and between the small hills."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"very slow object moving across sky with glowing green discharge","Date Submitted":"10/31/2010 05:54 UTC","Latitude":"41.664536","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Monticello","There were no other sightings in Monticello on or around November 9th 1995"],"Log Number":"US-10312010-0017","City":"Monticello","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.682528","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.664536,+-74.682528(26251)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26251) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York"}
