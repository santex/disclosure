{"City":"Palmerston North","Latitude":"-40.343166","Summary":"I saw a number of metalic objects at aprox. 3.25pm. There would have been 7-9.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my study which is a conservatory. I stepped outside to have a cigarette. I happened to see a flash out of the corner of my eye. I looked up and saw approx 7-9 objects. They appeared to be hovering together. They then split up and went in different directions. The objects moved at variable speeds. The highest speed being very fast crossing from one side of where they were approx south-north in about 4 seconds. They seemed to disappear and reappear. I think this may have been very thin cloud at a high altitude. The day was clear and warm. I watched the objects do completely unatural manouvres. The object appeared to be metalic to white. It was a egg shape. I have seen a UFO when I was younger but nothing like this experience. I was intrigued and just blown away at to what I was witnessing. I tried to rationalize an explanation to being natural phenomonen but could not come up with any rational explanation. I do have a science backround and have been trained to be skeptical, but in this case I was just left scratching my head. My partner was at the supermarket and by the time he came home the objects were quite high and small. He did see them but they were distant dots in the sky. I ruled out seeing floating seed and insects as the flight was too steady. Any slight wind would make seed or insects wobble. These objects did not do that. I ruled out seagulls because i could not see any wing movement and the speeds at which the objects travelled was too fast."],"Log Number":"NZ-02202008-0009","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9653.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9653_submitter_file1__NewZealandUFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9653.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-40.343166,+175.609994(9653)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9653) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Palmerston North","There were no other sightings in Palmerston North on or around February 20th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"9653","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Manawatu-Wanganui","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"175.609994","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"New Zealand","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"02/20/2008 03:25 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/20/2008 03:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
