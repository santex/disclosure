(i wasn���t looking at the video screen at that time and started slewing the scope down after it passed) i saw the object when reviewing all the clips from that session. i have captured many (identifiable) objects through a scope and camcorder; planes, birds, satellites, balloons and even some guy���s radio controlled airplane that looked very much like a full size plane because of its distance. all of these objects have their own characteristics such as; planes leave a heat signature that lingers for several seconds in its wake. wings, tail and fuselage are detectable. and the contrail in the right conditions, not to mention lights. not only that, all air traffic at that time was well below my fov and could be seen without optical assistance. and the flight paths run diagonally to this objects direction. satellites captured with this scope can clearly see solar panels. they pass by slightly slower too, making them easier to identify. and the shape and outline of satellites are even more defineable possibly because they are outside the atmosphere. birds flapping wings. unless the bird is \"seagull size\" or larger, they look like dark, blurry, small \"sticks\" streaking by and much faster. they also have to be close to be detectable at all. if at a great distance, their characteristics are more defineable and they don't leave any detectable air turbulance. this object is interesting to me because it doesn���t have any of the characteristics of the ones mentioned above. i estimate its altitude at 45 to 50,000 feet based on air traffic seen below it. i estimate its distance from me to be a minimum of 10 miles knowing my scopes capabilities. the moon was about 40 degrees above horizon. if these figures are close, then the object could be 10 to 30 meters in diameter depending on its actual distance. the consistent sun reflection along its top edge suggests a metallic skin. there is also an odd dark area near the center of the object. it almost looks like a hole. when zoomed-in, it looks like you can see the moon's features through the \"hole\". i don���t think it���s a shadow because the sun is behind the scope and to the left and slightly higher than the moon. a shadow should be forward (the direction it���s heading) and slightly left of that position. it also leaves quite a bit of air turbulence after passing by signifying it���s in the atmosphere, however there isn���t enough distortion for it to be a heat signature. jets, large and small leave a blast of hot exhaust for several seconds in its wake. at 30fps, the object was captured on 7 frames. the first frame, only shows the front edge and the next frame was duplicated. so only 5 frames show each new position. anyone with video software can break down the video into frames. cropped from a 30second, 650mb avi file. available on cd free but i would need a mailing address. anyone wanting a copy just ask. i would like a professional editor and investigator to check it out. scope: orion 8��� sc, tracking off focal length: 2032mm camera: orion starshoot solar system color imaging camera ii sensor: 1\\2 inch, color cmos progressive scan, ir filter res: 1.3mp 1280x1024 pixel layout software: maxim dl essentials photo\\digital video capture recording settings: video capture at 640x480, 30fps, 30 seconds blue ���light pollution��� filter attached to an adjustable polarized filter at 20% time: 08:33, 04\\09\\07 direction: facing ssw about 40 degrees above horizon. in the edited clip, i contrast and bright adjusted the two zoomed-in frames. that���s the only enhanced part of the edited version. full resolution original digital video avi file not modified. if you ask for the cd, it is recommended to download the clip off the cd to your computer to view. i have found the clip drops frames when viewed from the cd and i have a 3ghz processor. as above, available on request. use of my name and email ok. thank you,"],"Summary":"Daylight Capture of Disk Through Scope","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.978027,+-122.028696(6900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6900) map </A>","Case Number":"6900","Latitude":"36.978027","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Santa Cruz","There were no other sightings in Santa Cruz on or around April 9th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City"}
