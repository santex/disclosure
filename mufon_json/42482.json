It was a clear night, stars were clear, saw what looked to be a helicopter shaped object heading due east close to or just south of Highway 7, or going east away from Hutchinson. This object was traveling at what appeared to be a routine speed for a helicopter, however, no flashing lights were observed, just a solid bright white glow. The object appeared to be about 500ft. in the sky. I saw and tracked this object for about 15 seconds total. This object peaked my curiosity, so out of intuition, I flashed my high beams several times just as it was in the sky, crossing my line of travel. No more than 2 seconds after flashing my high beams 3-4 times, the object simply vanished or changed direction so fast that I could not see where it went. I estimate my distance from the object at about 3 miles ahead, heard no sound, saw no flashing aviation lights at all."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-94.374889","Date Submitted":"09/11/2012 04:14 UTC","Country":"United States"}
