I observed something unusual in the sky above Sioux City. I saw three objects, two of which appeared to be shaped like arrow-heads and the third appeared like a large jet with much larger than usual tail-fin and a large item attached to the bottom, and was changing shapes. The first object, shaped like an arrow-head was going side-ways appeared to stay in this side-ways position and move to the north while gradually increasing in altitude. The second object, the large one, was moving in the same direction and appeared to rise vertically and then horizontally with the third object following closed behind, just like a military jet getting refueled. Then the third smaller object appeared to attach it���s self to the larger object and they (it) continued to move off to the north while climbing. The two small arrows appeared to be black while the large object appeared to change between orange, grey, white and black, The shape of this larger object changed somewhat. The current conditions are mostly sunny and windy. The wind is coming very strong from the south, making it a windy but very nice day. I have no idea what I saw, but I believe that many people should have seen this because it is a nice Saturday afternoon. Sioux City has an airport south of town at which are stationed KC-135 refueling planes. I have seen these planes fly both day and night along with many other types of aircraft. The objects I observed today did not seem to behave like any aircraft I have ever seen before. This is the second time in a year I have seen something in the sky that has baffled me. However, this last event was far more dramatic because, it being daylight outside, I was completely at a loss for what I witnessed. Up until last fall I have never seen anything in the sky which I could not identify including planes, birds, satellites and even a blimp on one occasion. I am not making a claim to what I saw, except this: I saw three objects flying in the sky that I could not identify and the likes of which I have never seen before. I observed these objects from a hill overlooking the Western Iowa Tech campus. This hill is just south of the college. As I stated before, other people should have seen this. It is a very nice afternoon. 1. I am a security officer for Western Iowa Tech. I was in a parking lot on top of a hill checking for vehicles that do not belong on our property when I looked west, into the sky and saw the obects. 2. I first noticed the large object becuase it was so large, I thought, for a breif moment that they were military aircraft, which I enjoy veiwing. 3. I thought it was a KC 135 falling apart, becuase the shape was changing. I thought there may have been a re-fueling accident. 4. The two smaller objects looked like arrow heads flying on their sides. The larger object looked ( fow a moment ) like a KC 135 with a much large tail fin carring a rectange shaped box. 5. I could hear no sounds, of course, it was windy out. But my heart raced when I realized that it was not a KC 135. I got of the car and ran to the top of the hill. I kept thinking to myself and saying outloud, what the heck is that! I was in a state of wonder and dis-belief. 6. The objects move off to the north and I eventually lost site of them.
