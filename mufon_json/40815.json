{"Date Submitted":"07/15/2012 02:57 UTC","Latitude":"41.458939","Summary":"6 to 10 solid flying objects","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","City":"Valparaiso","Object Features":"Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsI stepped out of car in parking lot. Looked up and saw a close glowing object moving across sky from my left to right it was a oval shaped object glowing orange with other pulsating blue and green, it was a solid object the size of passenger jet and moving about the same speed. Then I noticed several more coming from my left to right in a staggered pattern. I could see these things clear as day. There was between 6 and ten of these things. And as I stood there totaly awe struck I heard a passenger jet coming in from over my right shoulder towards Chicago I was surprised to see that these things looked to be same in size to the jet. the objects were closer to the ground and actualy flew under the flight path of the jet. I live in a flight path leading into Chicago and see a lot of air traffic, but im 52 years old and have never seen anything like this except in movies. No ufo home videos could do justice to what I saw. These things are the real thing and I dont know that I will ever be the same again."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Valparaiso","There were no other sightings in Valparaiso on or around July 14th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40815.html"],"Case Number":"40815","Log Number":"US-07152012-0006","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.458939,+-87.036654(40815)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40815) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Indiana","Date of the Event":"07/14/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-87.036654"}
