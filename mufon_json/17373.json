{"Summary":"A red sphere even in color and apparent texture, larger than a balloon but smaller than a prop plane.","Log Number":"US-06072009-0012","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting details a friend and i were canoeing through the mangroves in oleta river park on sunday, may 31st 20009 leading out into biscayne bay. as we exited the mangroves from the most east exit (marked as the way to \"blue moon\") we headed due south towards the nearest pair of uninhabited islands in biscayne bay. unfortunately, i did not check the time while i witnessed the object in question, i was honestly just left confused as to what it could be. however, if i was asked to estimate the time it would be sometime between 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm as it was in the middle of our canoe trip. the trip began at roughly 11:00 am and ended around 3:30 pm. the aforementioned object was small in size relative to other planes and assorted small aircraft that i see passing over the area. from my vantage point i could see not only the object, but also my place of employment. this is an area that i know well. the object would be larger than a pilates ball (sorry, lack of a better example) but smaller than a single prop plane. it was cloudy and other aircraft were in the general area allowing a slight estimate on size. it was red, and from my vantage perfectly round. i first noticed the object in the distance. i looked at the horizon to pick a mark in order to paddle straight across the small channel. i joked to my friend, \"look, some slobbery kid is crying somewhere, its a rogue balloon.\" i looked away for nearly ten seconds and then found it again quite easily. finding it so easily really drew my attention to the object, it was the direction and nature of its flight. please remember this is happening over biscayne bay between north miami and sunny isles beach. this place is windy and right on the atlantic. not only that, but winds were erratic that day and we had been plagued by storms all week. yet, here is this red balloon following a direct line at a constant speed. as it passed nearly over head i could see how spherical it actually was. the sphere's path was moving from the south\\south-west to the north\\north-east. as far as i could tell it never deviated from its path or changed its speed. at its closest it appeared to be a shiny solid red plastic sphere, nothing more and nothing less. i only lost sight of the object as it passed over the trump tower area of sunny isles beach and floated off into the distance. the entire span of time is hard to estimate... five to ten minutes would be my best guess. i did not really know what to think, and put it out of my mind. this afternoon i walked out of work and onto the beach to see today's storm. i thought of this object and just couldn't get it out of my mind. this is the second time in my life that i have seen something in the sky that i cannot explain, and i thought i would share this experience while it was still fresh in my mind. i still have no idea what this object could be. i want to say that its just a balloon, but the reality just doesn't add up. my friend, a man of science and skepticism, said it may be a new weather balloon. after thinking it over he claims to have no idea, just like me. and just to be clear, we were not under the influence of drugs or alcohol."],"Case Number":"17373","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in North Miami Beach","There were no other sightings in North Miami Beach on or around May 31st 2009"],"Longitude":"-80.153316","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"05/31/2009 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"25.940219","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","City":"North Miami Beach","Date of the Event":"05/31/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17373.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17373.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.940219,+-80.153316(17373)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17373) map </A>"}
