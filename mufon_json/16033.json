While waiting at his front door I saw 3 red pulsating lights glide down the street. I rang the door bell and 3 of us watched this triangle glide through the air. It was not airplanes, helicopters, baloons, kites or anything we could indentify. We saw a plane flying somewhat above and to the right of it. It was very peculiar. 3 witnesses. I am very interested to know if anyone in Marlborough, CT saw this object. It is hard to believe no one else saw this. Please contact me if anyone else saw this Thank you.
