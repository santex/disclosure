{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing alone at the bus stop at 8:45 a.m. looking in a southeasterly direction when I spotted a silver sphere streak through the sky at an estimated distance of half a mile and several hundred feet off the ground. The object was observed for a brief 2-3 seconds at a 45 degree angle from the horizon and traveling in a clear blue sky. It was the size of a dime held at arms length and heading in the direction of Alexandria, VA and the Potomac River. It���s flight path from behind me would have had it traveling over the Pentagon. It reflected the sun���s light, and traveled about the same speed that a falling star would be traveling; there was no sound and it simply vanished in flight, not just disappearing over the horizon. I hadn���t planned on reporting this except that it seemed very similar to the silver-colored sphere described in case 22347 one hour later in Pennsylvania."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22353.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22353.html"],"Region":"Virginia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.811676,+-77.037281(22353)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22353) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"38.811676","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"22353","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Silver Sphere Seen in Nothern Virginia","Date of the Event":"03/17/2010 08:45 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Alexandria","There were no other sightings in Alexandria on or around March 17th 2010"],"City":"Alexandria","Longitude":"-77.037281","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-03172010-0019","Date Submitted":"03/17/2010 10:40 UTC"}
