{"divs":["sighting detailsmy wife was and daughter were yelling that i need to come out side and see this. i had just got in bed. i ran out side and was so amazed by what i saw i came back in the house got dressed and went out on the back deck. there were 4 very bright lights in a stationary position. they started to spin in a circluar motion. one light went out, a third started to flicker and went out. i called the next door neighbor to make sure someone else from another household saw what we were seeing. the neighbor saw the 2 lights and then they both went out. i'm not really a believer of this stuff but this really freaked me out. the area it was in is a state park w\\a large lake, very woody and quite. the other freaky thing is....we could see the lights and the motion of the lights but we took pictures and you could see the lights when i took the picture but nothing is on the memory stick, same with the video camera, we could see the lights through the camera but the videao is black."],"Date Submitted":"03/25/2009 09:10 UTC","City":"Tamaqua","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"16245","Log Number":"US-03252009-0014","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","Latitude":"40.797311","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Tamaqua","There was one other sighting in Tamaqua on or around March 25th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.797311,+-75.969371(16245)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16245) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/25/2009 09:10 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Circle of lights rotating.","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Longitude":"-75.969371","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16245.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16245.html"]}
