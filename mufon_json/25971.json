Boy it was a good close up view but when using zoom lenses it cause the camera to become instable. I tried to hold on the camera for few seconds to get a good look on the object. After like 30 seconds or more I had to get the tripod so I could get a closer and steady view. I ran into my house and grap the tripod and out like 10 seconds. I looked up in the sky hoping it will remain there. I looked everywhere for it, it was gone in a flash. I am including my video for you to analysis and send me your professional opinion about my spaceship video."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Bullet shape lunar looking ship hovering near California Air Force Base","Log Number":"US-10192010-0002","Longitude":"-121.48698","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
