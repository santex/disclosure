Mostly clear afternoon, sometime mid week in late Oct. Very few clouds in the sky. I looked up and saw an aluminum like sphere hovering in the sky right by a cloud, a few other people also saw it. After a couple minutes of looking at it, we engaged in conversation concerning it, looked back up and it was gone (only a few seconds after taking our eyes off of it). Another couple minutes go by and we see it again, in a different spot in the sky. It was hard to tell the size of the object, how high up it was, so it was hard to tell how far it traveled from the initial spot of the sighting to the spot it was in now. After about 1.5 minutes of looking at it, it very quickly moved southbound, at least 4 times the speed of an airplane. I did try to take a video with my cellphone, but it was too bright out to see the object on the video."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Moscow","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"10/27/2012 01:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-01212013-0011","Date Submitted":"01/21/2013 12:34 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
