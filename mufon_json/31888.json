I immediately knew this was something unusual so I took him back inside and grabbed my phone. It was bigger than any planet or star and pulsated as it slowing travelled across the sky from west to east. My perception was that it was very high and probably miles away. We have those really tall palm trees in our neighborhood and it was travelling above them. It then stopped and in my perception hovered for a few minutes and slowly became smaller and smaller until it disappeared. This led me to believe that it was heading south. Possibly it was not hovering at all, but changed directions and appeared to be hovering. I tried to take a video with my cell phone but when I looked at it all I could see where normal colored stars. A plane did closely pass by it and I remember thinking to myself, \"don't they see that?\" There were no other witnesses to the event."],"Longitude":"-111.891281","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Chandler","There were no other sightings in Chandler on or around September 16th 2011"],"Summary":"Red Star-like object South of Chandler","Date of the Event":"09/16/2011 08:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Arizona","Case Number":"31888","Latitude":"33.341915","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09182011-0017","City":"Chandler","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31888.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31888.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/18/2011 06:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
