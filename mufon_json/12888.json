MY FATHER CAME FIRST, LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW, AND GRABBED THE TELESCOPE. \"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ?\" HE SAID. I ANSWERED \" IT���S A FLYING SAUCER, WE���VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING THEM IN SCHOOL\". MY MOTHER THEN CAME IN TO MY BEDROOM AND ONLY HAD TIME TO SEE IT, STILL FLYING A FAIRLY SLOW COURSE DUE SOUTH, NEARLY AT THE HORIZON. WHEN IT HAD GONE WE ALL DISCUSSED WHAT WE HAD SEEN, viz. A GREEN OVAL, SLIGHTLY NARROWER AT THE FRONT, FLYING VERY STEADILY DIRECTLY SOUTH FOR ABOUT 30 OR 40 SECONDS. DAD AND I, WHO HAD SEEN IT THROUGH THE ���SCOPE, THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE HAD A SLIGHTLY BRIGHTER RIM WITH A SLIGHTLY YELLOW TINGE TO IT. WE LOOKED IN THE PAPERS THE NEXT DAY TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAD SEEN IT, AND FOUND ONE REPORT OF AN EXTREMELY SIMILAR OBJECT SEEN IN BRIGHTON, SUSSEX, DIRECTLY SOUTH OF LONDON, SEEN THE EVENING BEFORE, ABOUT 2 HOURS AFTER WE HAD SEEN \"OUR\" UFO. SINCE THEN, IN THE WORDS OF THE SONG, \"I���M A BELIEVER\" !!! YOUR POINTS 1. I, 14 YEARS OLD, WAS INTERESTED IN ASTRONOMY AND REGULARLY BEFORE SLEEPING HAD A LOOK OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW, AND IF IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT, I���D GET MY TELESCOPE OUT AND LOOK UP AT THE STARS. 2. IT \"FLEW\" INTO THE BOTTOM OF MY VIEW THROUGHT THE TELESCOPE 3. I WAS EXCITED, NOT SURE BUT HOPING IT WAS A UFO AS WE HAD JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS IN MY CLASS AT SCHOOL. 4. ABOVE 5. STILL EXCITED, AND GLAD MY PARENTS HAD SEEN IT TOO. 6. IT FLEW OVER THE SOUTHERN HORIZON, NEVER DEVIATING FROM ITS STEADY COURLE SOUT."],"Summary":"GLOWING GREEN FLYING STRAIGHT OVER ME FROM NORTH TO SOUTH"}
