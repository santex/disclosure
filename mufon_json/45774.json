There was no sound at all. First I saw 3 lights and a few minutes later another set of 3 lights appeared behind. They clearly had the shape of a triangle although 2 of the lights got closer to one another at some point. After 4 mins, 2 lights of the first triangle faded away then so did the 3rd one. And a couple of minutes later, the exact thing happened to the other triangle. It was really weird, especially the colour which was really orange... as if it was fire, actually. I wish I'd had been able to take some pics but I had run out of battery...
