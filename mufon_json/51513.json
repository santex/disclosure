I believed what I was seeing was a plane or possibly helicopter however it was staying in one spot going to the right then left and at times up and down. I awoke my wife stating, \"you need to come see something.\" My wife stood on the deck and witnessed the same. Greenish pulsating rhythmic lights were seen but the object moved left then right, over and over. Approximately 30 seconds after my wife was watching with me, a very fast rapid white beam shot from that object. That did not happen again. My wife went to sleep and the object remained hovering until approx 5am. I Did not see it disappear as I had gone back to sleep."],"Object Features":"Other","Longitude":"-70.456552","Tags":"City","Region":"Maine","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Biddeford"}
