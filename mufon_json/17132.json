Had it been a jet it would have left vapor trails and noise, but it was silent and clean, it wasn't a satellite because it was at low flying altitude and it was swirving","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"38.901212","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around May 24th 2009"],"Region":"Washington","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"17132","divs":["sighting detailswe watched the large star object move from the most western horizon to the most eastern horizon within a minute or less--it was moving very fast--freaky fast. i'm an experienced enough sky watcher to know that it wasn't a satellite because the object was swerving and was flying at a lower altitude. the object was an extremely bright\\large object in the night sky that wasn't blinking but it was swerving--can't express that enough--it was swerving, not at a fixed orbit or flight path. didn't make a sound, didn't leave a vapor trail, it just booked really fast across the sky. faster than a jet, faster than a satellite. i watched it fly over salmon creek from vancouver, washington. 1. we were celebrating my birthday as a family at my aunt's house. i spotted the object after my younger cousin (18) pointed it out--i was drinking, but she was completely sober and spotted it first. five other people saw it and everyone came to the conclusion that the object was extraordinary. 2. we noticed the object because it was moving across the sky at a speed that made us feel uncomfortable because we have never seen anything move across the sky so fast. 3. initially we entertained the idea that it was a jet plane, but nobody could see any blinking lights on the object, and it didn't make a sound or vapor trails. 4. the object moved in a straight line but swerved from side to side as it made it's way across the sky. zig zaged across the sky but in a controlled way. 5. everyone who experienced witnessing the object was perplexed to explain it--everyone marveled at how fast it moved over us without leaving vapor trails or sound. before it disappeared the consensus among us was that it was indeed a ufo. 6. it kept traveling east toward eastern washington. everyone watched it until it disappeared beyond our vision on the eastern horizon of our sky. and this was the scariest point of the observation, this object was capable to travel from one horizon to another within a minute, a minute. it was remarkable among everyone who witnessed it."],"City":"Washington","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17132.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17132.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.901212,+-77.033806(17132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17132) map </A>"}
