{"Summary":"very white bright light like shooting star sped, then stopped in sky","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving with a friend on the 210 Freeway, heading west, when all of a sudden we saw a very bright white light in the sky above us shoot through at a very high speed. It was like a shooting star, but too bright and too low, and all of a sudden it stopped and faded in its luminosity, looking like a normal plane light, but it didn't seem to move like one. It stayed in the sky and seemed to travel slowly north."],"Longitude":"-117.861479","Date Submitted":"09/12/2005 03:30 UTC","Case Number":"3843","Latitude":"34.139749","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3843.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3843.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.139749,+-117.861479(3843)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3843) map </A>","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/12/2005 03:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Glendora","There was one other sighting in Glendora on or around September 12th 2005"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09122005-0006","City":"Glendora","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
