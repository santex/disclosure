At first I thought it might be an airplane,and the sun was making some weird reflection of light on the planes body.As I looked on I noticed it was getting smaller.I still thought it might be an airplane that was now turning and I was going to get a look at maybe the planes tail or make out some wings,but it just disappeared.I was staring there in amazement when the object reappeared directly below from where on first saw it. It reappeared and disappeared in a split second.I told the wife and kids of what I just saw and they just laughed!! I thought it would be cool to share with you."],"Log Number":"US-08112010-0004","Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"08/11/2010 12:42 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/26/2010 01:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.316111","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Rhode Island","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Westerly","There were no other sightings in Westerly on or around July 26th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25063.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25063.html"],"Longitude":"-71.844861","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Westerly","Source":"MUFON"}
