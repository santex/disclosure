Several people exited the building and noticed the lights in the sky. Shortly after, several helicopters and emergency sirens could be heard in the area, but not sure if they were responding to the lights. The lights faded out, then reappear in random locations in the sky several (more than five) times. My son caught it on his phone camera, so it's kind of hard to see. At about the middle of the video you can make out a light at the center of the screen. They were joking about what they thought they might be seeing, but then quickly got excited and nervous at the thought that it really could be a UFO. The ringing noise on the video is the fire alarm from the school, but the kids say that they heard a low pitch noise--a \"boom\"--that continued to hum for about a minute after. We contacted local media and authorities, but no one seems to be able to explain it."],"Date Submitted":"03/23/2009 08:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Region":"Florida"}
