I then called yelled out for my son and called another neighbor out to see the flashing blue light. My husband called the police to report this sighting. We used two cell phones to record and also two digital cameras that recorded the object. We continued to monitor object and at times you can clearly see a three lights that form a triangle and then it would move in erratic motion the light would dim then it would get brighter appearing as a circle. We automatically thought it was a UFO because of the vivid Royal blue color. We lost the object in the clouds."],"Region":"California","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Medium","Longitude":"-117.157485","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/15/2009 10:18 UTC","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in San Marcos","There were 2 other sightings in San Marcos on or around October 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"10/17/2009 01:59 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.151392,+-117.157485(19975)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19975) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19975.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19975.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10172009-0001","Case Number":"19975","City":"San Marcos","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Triangle"}
