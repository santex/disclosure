Looked up to see low flying airplane approx. 300 feet in altitude, following closely behind were 3 bright red-orange objects and one white object. The first 3 then formed into a triangle ahead of the white object. I took out my cell phone and filmed the objects for 1 minute 7 seconds. The objects dissolved and disappeared. The objects were flying slowly from south to north, following the shoreline of Lake Michigan. They were approximately 300 feet in altitude. We viewed the objects for approximately 3 minutes. We knew immediately these were not airplanes, helicopters, balloons, fireworks or like anything we had ever seen before."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","Log Number":"US-07052013-0006","Case Number":"48630","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.586132,+-87.816475(48630)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48630) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48630.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48630.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 10:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Kenosha","There were no other sightings in Kenosha on or around July 4th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle"}
