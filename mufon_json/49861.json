i did this morning 1856 - was done after i returned home last night. 6884 - pic i took this afternoon of location. cell phone tower is in middle right above trees."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Mississippi","Case Number":"49861","City":"Tunica Resorts","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/49861_submitter_file1__IMG1855.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/49861_submitter_file2__IMG1856.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/49861_submitter_file3__IMG6884.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49861.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-90.322774","Latitude":"34.815794","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Three bright spheres in triangle formation hoovering above horizon.
