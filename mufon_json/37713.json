I was followed after making attempts to contact by flashing my brights and waving them to come down after it followed me to my f Friends house it turned off it's brights which reminded me of a really bright reflection like a rainbow and the light went to the surface metal and it glowed like lightsaber orange when my friends came outside it stopped and went away though that was Subday night.
