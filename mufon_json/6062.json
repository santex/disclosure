{"divs":["sighting detailson any clear day point a video camera with a long lens (100x plus) directly at the sun. be sure to block the disk of the sun with an object such as a streetlight, they work well. focus to infinity and stop down to your highest f-stop and shoot at 1\\1000 sec or faster. using a canon gl2 i stopped to f-8 and shot at 1\\8000 and 1\\15000 sec shutter speed and 30 frames per second \"frame mode\". the result was seeing dozens if not hundreds of craft circling in a pattern in our line of sight to the sun. they are cooperating given the speed they must be traveling it's impressive there are no collisions. i've gone out four times and each time i am able to repeat the results of the first shoot. people have said it looks like dust floating around a streetlight. dust never moves that fast and when zoomed in it doesn't look like any dust i've seen. see what you think. i'm sending full zoom stills from the videos. http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=v0hzkf7oog0 is low res video. at the end of this clip look for a sphereical metalic object drifting in toward the sun from the top of the frame. the object blocking the sun is a streetlight. if you pause the video often you can see individual craft frozen in the pattern. you can also see craft leaving the pattern and some just glide past on their own way. near the end of the clip during the zoom in, notice the speed of circulation and realize these craft are 25 to 75 miles away from the camera. the pattern must be hundreds of miles around the circle and the craft make a complete circuit several times every second. 1. where: mt ashland ski resort parking lot what: shooting alien video 2. i discovered this from still images shot earlier that summer. 3. the objects are alien craft, what else could they be? 4. description: look at the pictures there are different types. 5. validation is how it feels. 6. i lost sight when i turned off the camera. they are there any time we want to look, but we need the camera's fast \"eye\" to see them. it works like a strobe light works to time the ignition of a car. the strobe allows us to see the timing mark on the harmonic balancer rather than a blur."],"Date Submitted":"08/22/2006 11:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Ashland","There were no other sightings in Ashland on or around August 22nd 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Ashland","Longitude":"-122.705487","Latitude":"42.203876","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Multiple different craft in rapid circling pattern","Date of the Event":"08/22/2006 11:00 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.203876,+-122.705487(6062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6062) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6062_submitter_file1__detail72x.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6062_submitter_file2__detail12x.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6062_submitter_file3__Billy.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6062.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"6062","Log Number":"US-01032007-0003","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Region":"Oregon"}
