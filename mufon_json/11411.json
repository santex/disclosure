{"Longitude":"-76.529966","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI never saw anything like it before. Thought a plane may have exploded in the sky, but nothing fell to Earth. The very next evening, on the eleven o'clock news, channel 6 from Philadelphia, I heard and saw the exact fireball on T.V. It was reported that night that on July 1, over the Philadelphia area many people reported seeing several fireballs. They were reported being seen over shopping centers in or near Phila. Philadelphia is about eighty miles away from my home and I didn't copy down the places that it was reported to have been seen. My daughter is a reporter in Lancaster, PA., and she told me to call WGAL TV in Lancaster and report what I saw., which I did. I looked in our local papers and told only a few neighbors and my husband, who was sitting with me on our patio but not looking in the snouthwest direction where this odd sight occured."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Wrightsville","There were no other sightings in Wrightsville on or around July 1st 2008"],"Latitude":"40.025653","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11411.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07032008-0020","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Looked like an explosion.
