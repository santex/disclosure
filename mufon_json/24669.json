I stopped to look at the ocean and to my right over the water at about the level a small plane would fly, I saw two sets of very bright, rectangular shaped yellow-orange lights which appeared, blinking on in a sequence of three two times. The first time they blinked on, the two sets were next to each other, separated by a space about equal to how big they appeared. Then there was a 1-2 second gap, and then the lights appeared again, blinking on in a sequence, but this time separated by a space about three times as big as before. Then they blinked off, leaving an empty sky. The whole sighting lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. I saw two people down the beach and walked over to them to see if they had seen the same thing. They had and were excited and mystified, as I was. I watched for another 30 minutes or so and walked back to the house. I told my brother and sister-in-law about the lights. They told me they had seen them too from our deck overlooking the ocean."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07202010-0003","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"Two sets of three rectangular bright yellow-orange lights that blinked on in a sequence twice then disappeared.","Longitude":"-79.287826","Region":"South Carolina","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Georgetown","There were no other sightings in Georgetown on or around July 19th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24669.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24669.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.385434,+-79.287826(24669)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24669) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/19/2010 09:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/20/2010 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24669"}
