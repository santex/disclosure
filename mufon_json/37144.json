It was my nephews birthday so my 3 sister, 3 brothers and myself all were on the porch or our mom's house just talking ( no alcohol was consumed by anyone). It was a clear sky. You could see every star and just out of no where we hear this very loud rumble. We see the object for about 4 minutes than it leaves."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Waterloo","There were no other sightings in Waterloo on or around September 16th 1996"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00"}
