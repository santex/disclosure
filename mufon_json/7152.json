Well i did I noticed a dim light much dimmer than the stars moving so fast out of the east that I called my girlfriend outside so I could have a second opinion I was very exited ! She came out back I had to point it out by blocking the flood light from her eyes with my hand like a horse blind once I had blocked out the flood light she noticed it we agreed on both having a visual on it it and then it glowed extremly bright twice and vanished . I saw some thing similar in Houston Texas in 02 or 03 Same sort of thing had a feeling if I went outside i might see something went out side up on a roof off in the distance a saw a very very bright light head twards me said holy smokes out load to my suprise ther was someone else on the roof who repeted it I said do you see that ? The person said yes and at that moment The light flared and shot straight up and disapeared into sky ! This sighting is what keened my eye to my last sighting ! I seriously dont think these were shooting stars or satilites because they were flying over the land in a straight level line and then when I confirm with others the visual they disapare with a flash . I dont know what these things were but I thought it quite strange it should happen twice !"],"Region":"Rhode Island","Source":"MUFON","City":"Fall River","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Fall River","There were no other sightings in Fall River on or around June 2nd 2007"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/02/2007 11:35 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-06042007-0009","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"7152","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7152.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7152.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.709711,+-71.153005(7152)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7152) map </A>"}
