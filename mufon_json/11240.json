Later that night after the moon was full I noticed a very bright light next to the moon. It looked like the same object that I had been seing the last couple of nights. I took over 700 pictures of this object changing shape in front of the moon. There were other objects that did the same thing as this onject in other parts of the sky and I have pictures of them doing the same thing. Changing shaopes like a electric tape worm.
