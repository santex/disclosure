At first I thought it was paper lanterns or an airplane, but upon further inspection they were way too perfectly spherical to be lanterns, and too big to be plane lights. They hovered slowly in a Northward path for about 15 minutes, before stopping briefly and shooting up into the air, their light disintegrating as they shot up. When my mom and I first saw the objects, she had grabbed my arm and told me that she felt her stomach drop, and felt very uneasy. For about 10 minutes after the sighting, I had a dull headache near the back of my skull and my eyes felt dry and ached."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32173.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32173.html"],"Log Number":"US-09292011-0003","Summary":"triangle formation of three bright green orbs floating slowly towards the North of Tortolita Mountain then shooting up and disappearing","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"09/27/2011 09:33 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Tucson","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There was one other sighting in Tucson on or around September 27th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"32.226453","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-110.919269","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.226453,+-110.919269(32173)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32173) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"32173"}
