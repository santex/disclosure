Immediately I noticed a bright round \"star\" looking object flying above and behind the jet and catching up in speed. The object speed up to the jet and started to turn right, and the same time the round object began to slow down and speed up very quickly. The object appeared to be \"playing\" with the jet. The jet must have been cruising at mach speeds and flying above 60,00 feet. The object itself was much higher and traveling much faster. This was an amazing sighting to see in miami , FL. Both objects were very high and small, however it was very obvious to me that the first craft was indeed a military jet as for commercial airliners DO NOT fly this high. The 2nd object was indeed quite amazing. This easily could have been a ufo breaking into U.S airspace, and jets being scrambled to intercept."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Latitude":"27.666817","Date Submitted":"07/06/2008 10:15 UTC","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
