I first thought they were 3 birds gliding. Thenthese lights got closer to us and then started toward the West. That92s when we noticed, since the moon was toward the West, that these lights wereon the bottom of a (equilateral) triangular shaped object. The object thenappeared to turn on one of its sides and started moving West. All sides of theobject were equal in length and flat on all sides, including the top and bottom. It seemed to be about 25-50 feet thick with equal sides about 150-200 feet longeach, and it had no fins or rudders. The lights we saw on the object were alsoequally spaced on the object in a triangular pattern. Then we watched as itdisappeared (traveled) to the West. All this happened within about 30 secondsand with no sound."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"","City":"Pensacola","Date Submitted":"01/01/2001 02:45 UTC","Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw a triangular shaped object directly above my"}
