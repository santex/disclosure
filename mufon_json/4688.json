At first I thought it was a bag but after a few seconds I noticed it was higher than I first thought.I grabbed my camcorder to get a closer look and zoomed out to 22x (optical). Then around 30-40x digital. Camera has no image stability system so video is rather wobbly.The object seemed to be rocking up and down but keep one end facing in the direction it was going. There was no sound and it was moving at a cross angle to the wind.After a few minutes it went behind a cloud and I never saw it come out."]}
