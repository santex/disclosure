Looked up and saw shiney disc flying at high speed over power lines on south side of freeway. Visually followed disc as it crossed over the freeway heading north east. Looked around and saw other people watching and pointing at it, too. I hurried to take the Green Valley exit to make it home and grab my binoculars. Last seen heading towards Vacaville area. I ran back outside with binoculars, but it had gone over the hills and was out of sight. Simply amazing and so exciting to see! Incidentally, a sceptic might claim it to be an airplane shining in the sun - coming from the West - behind me. I got a clear look at it, however, and saw it to be disc shaped and moving at a velocity no fighter could have matched. I'm retired USAF and know a plane when I see one. There is a lot of air traffic nearby, but this was unlike anything akin to a plane... wrong shape, shiney white, and moving incredibly fast."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.254848,+-122.030546(18798)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18798) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/21/2009 07:15 UTC"}
