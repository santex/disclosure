I sit on a chair facing south. My workplace is located in between Bowles and Belleview on S. Federal. I see a slight glow in the clouds in the distance( over 10 miles away) i thought at first it was a spotlight that businesses use in grand openings. After the circular glow grew closer at the speed it was moving i ruled out the spotlight theory.. It flew directly over me at medium paced speed.. i watched it until it was out of my view due to the building directly behind me. the whole thing happened in about 15 secs. I wasnt scared, just kinda shocked. It was really cloudy so i dont think plane lights would even show through. this object was low and in the clouds.. the glow was coming from within clouds which were at a fairly low alttitude so i could get a good estimate of how large it was.. it was big.. whatever it was i know it wasnt a plane or a helicopter.. i just wish i had a camera.. cause for how short it seemed ive never seen anything like that.. i stayed out for a few more min. just to double check to see if it might have been a spotlight.. i just want to see if anyone else saw this crazy object"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.619661,+-105.00757(14253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14253) map </A>","Case Number":"14253"}
