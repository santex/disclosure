{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOver several years (I first saw it in August 2001) I've seen objects in the sky that first appeared as stars (no movment visible) until these objects started to move until with direction changes until the went over the horizon. Within a second these objects accelerated to a speed that was way faster than the ISS passing by. I've seen the MIR, the ISS and several salelites and I've never seen any of them standing still and then accelerating this fast, even making changes in direction."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52473.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52473.html"],"Summary":"Several sightings of \"moving stars\"","Tags":"City","Country":"Germany","Date Submitted":"11/28/2013 09:58 UTC","City":"Elsdorf","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"50.942249","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.942249,+6.569661(52473)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52473) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"DE-11282013-0004","Longitude":"6.569661","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Elsdorf","There were no other sightings in Elsdorf on or around August 15th 2001"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"North Rhine-Westphalia","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"52473","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"08/15/2001 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
