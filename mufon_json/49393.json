Look at the pickup in the background in picture one, and then where it is in picture two, the pictures were taken about 2 seconds apart and I did not see any aircraft flying in the area the entire time I was there. But picture two clearly has an object in the upper middle. I heard nothing but highway traffic no airplanes or helicopters and did not hear anything from the object. I noticed the object later looking at the photo and thought that is a UFO. Just want to know what the object is in photo two and how it seemed to just appear. I did not see the object when I took the photo. Thanks for looking,"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"07/28/2013 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Oregon","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in McMinnville","There were no other sightings in McMinnville on or around July 28th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"McMinnville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49393.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49393.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"45.219806","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
