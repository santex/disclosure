When I got to my sister's house, I told all of them that I just saw a UFO over their property. ���Everyone said I must have been mistaken etc., etc. The next day, my sister called me at home and said I was right about the UFO sighting and that she was reading the local newspaper that morning (Saturday) and it said that at least 100 people had called the police the night before saying that they had spotted a UFO. ���I wished that I had asked her to save a copy of that newspaper so that I could remember the exact date when this event occured. I have never forgotten this event and I can still see it clearly in my mind's eye. The impact of it has stayed with me for more than 40 years."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04192013-0015","Object Features":"Unknown"}
