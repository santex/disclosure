One flew overhead at a steady pace and was followed a minute later by another","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsat approximately 1:00am on saturday night\\sunday morning someone noticed a strange light flying overhead. it appeared to be a fireball, but it did not fizzle out and was traveling slowly, similar to the pace of an airplane. it did not leave a trail and appeared to be flickering a bit like it was on fire. once it had traveled almost all the way across the sky, it was followed by another object that followed the pace and route as the previous light. the two lights were exactly the same in their characteristics. there was no noise of a plane or helicopter. the lights were high overhead, probably at cloud height or higher--it was a clear night, it was hard to tell. the lights were large, bigger than a plane probably, they were big enough to catch people's attention."],"Log Number":"US-06242012-0017"}
