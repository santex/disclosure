{"Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"30.512315","divs":["sighting detailsi was outside in a field of hay or grass. the weather had broken from hot to thunderheads (no rain but delicious eddies of wind and coolness.) i put out the thought, \"well, come on then.\" shortly thereafter my experience began. i had had some experiences as a child but i never framed them as about ufo's. my parents wouldn't have mentioned such a thing to me. this was in wisconsin. i would talk more about this if asked. later, as a teenager i had friends who fancied themselves as advanced thinkers (and probably were). they researched the eating of peyote. this was about 1962. they had no idea that other white kids (at least in california) were altering their consciousnesses. i joined in on some of this experimentation but i was young (14) living at home and living an active life as a surfer and achiever at school. (i graduated as valedictorian). anyway they were interested in ufos and stood on empty stretches of beach (padre island, texas) and made circles and tried to call them down - without success. i was never along on those nights and in fact it frightened me. why it frightened me more than raw peyote is curious question... anyway. the night in question i had drank some semi-concentrated peyote tea. i'm going to say that straight out. the reason i was out dancing in the field alone was that i felt wonderful and in tune with what was. and it seemed to be the next step to invite them to respond. it was fully dark - at least 10 pm. shortly after i did so i went back into the house. there were 3 young men there. we were staying in a farmhouse near round rock which had not been lived in by farmers for a long time (it was rented.) the whole area was largely deserted. two of the men were my friends and they had invited me to come out of the city and be at the farm and help keep the fire going around the large cauldron of cooking down peyote. they had been working for days - getting it there, grinding it up, and they were tired. neither of them to my knowledge had used any substance that night. i do not remember there being any marijuana around. the third man belonged to a band who used the house to practice in. he did not know any of us and certainly did not know me. i believe he took something - probably acid earlier in the evening. we were on an upstairs porch that faced hmmm, maybe southwest (i could be wrong about that.) there were skudding clouds and few stars that were obscured and then shone. it was a beautiful peaceful night. then the light arrived. it zigzagged in front of eyes in long looping zzs. then it steadied directly in front of us. and then it landed slowly and straight down until its light was obscured by the scrub trees in that direction. we watched the light shine through the trees. and then the light went out. the mood was still jolly at that point. we decided to go see what it was. there had been no sound of plane or helicopter and we thought it probably was a ufo. the jokes were: \"would jc come back in a ufo?\", \"should we carry a flashlight or will that look like a weapon?\" \"maybe smiling (and showing our teeth) would not be polite.\" we were ok with all of this. one man had gone to bed pleading exhaustion. i had awakened him to witness the light and landing and then he grumbled off. we went outside and the mood changed immediately. there were dogs barking (far off in all directions), mooing cattle...we walked about half the distance that we thought was the right amount to walk and then we couldn't walk any closer. the hair was standing up on my neck, i was terrified, and my companions weren't in better shape. we turned around and walked back to the farm house. my friend gave up on the thought that i would tend the fire where the peyote was cooking. in fact we were concerned that they might sample it, thinking it soup (peyote tastes horrible but who knows about alien palates?). we went back upstairs but did not lock the downstairs doors as we felt that if \"they\" were coming for us that a mere wooden door wouldn't stop someone who had crossed a galaxy. we gathered in the living room. i felt that they were close by. by that i mean that i felt an intense feeling of contact of some sort. i am somewhat pre-cognitive but this was far far more intense that anything i had experienced in any state of mind. incidentally i had thrown up the peyote tea almost immediately and had had no hallucinations or such. just a euphoria (which was now long gone). my friend said, \"i'm going to go check the porch.\" i really felt something was close and started to say \"no!\" but then thought. if something is on the porch, we'll know momentarily. he went and checked and said, \"there's nothing there.\" which made me realize that maybe the closeness was a mental thing not a physical visitation. however i had waves of fear and my friend knew that. so i was amazed (in a bad way) when he said, \"i'm tired; i have to sleep, sorry...\" and stumbled away leaving me there. the other unknown man had at this point disappeared; i never saw him again until the next morning when he tore out of the driveway after saying, \"i don't want to talk about this. i never want to see any of you again!\" and i never did. i lay down on a bed with black cat which seemed to be living in the house. it alternately purred and scratched me - but not to get away. it and i were terrified, my heart was pounding and finally i thought, \"you are killing me. i can't handle this. i'm sorry.\" with that my vision narrowed to tiny point (like an old black and white tv) and then i woke up fairly late in the morning. we all showed up downstairs at the same time and shook our heads and said, \"what happened here last night?\" no one suggested that i had created it or had been hysterical or bad tripping. we thought about walking down to where we thought it had landed (?). but the circumstances of being in the middle of a botched mescaline batch and the thought of calling - who? a county sheriff? the press? this was redneck country. the legal consequence of being caught with even a joint was hard time in a prison. we could not afford to tell anyone and no one would have believed us even if we had. i knew then that no one would believe us and particularly me. i also knew that drinking or eating even a small quantity of peyote precludes sleep for at least 8 hours. it is not a \"recreational drug\". i never believed that i just \"fell asleep.\" there are a few postscripts to this story. one, years later a friend of mine who had heard my story told me that a man who was mayor of round rock told him that he had been awakened one summer night by two mexican kids who had ridden a burro over to his house. they pounded on the door saying that there was a ufo in a field near their house. he finally was persuaded to get up and get dressed and drive them out to where they said it was. when they got to the empty field, they said, \"it's gone.\" he had always assumed he had been hoaxed until he heard my story secondhand. i never talked to him (i had moved away by then) and am not sure that we were talking about the same night or even the same year. the farm we had been on was about 20 miles from a small air force base. it was also near a large electrical transformer field or whatever those fenced yards full of electrical stuff are called. when i had my firstborn child at age 32 i ended up needing an emergency c section. they rushed me into the operating room and were running meds into my arm to knock me out and my doctor (gowned and masked) leaned over me and said, \"goodnight paulette\". i had a huge panic reaction because at that moment, before i went out as a terrified young woman in texas i remembered fading out and in that brief flash before i went seeing someone\\thing leaning over me. when i woke up and was handed a baby i was still traumatized by that memory flash. ok. and my kids have had their own experiences. and i've had subsequent experiences (not as dramatic). in my dreams frequently (even now) i am watching the sky and see, way way above me the stars start to move. no one else seems to notice. then one drifts down and down until it is over my house or outside my window. i go outside. i also go outside to meet with them. there is never any more to that type of dream. (it is possible that other dreams are about aliens who are shapeshifters or can make people think they are people. the reason i think these dreams are related is the compulsion to meet with them. i was hypnotized by a woman who knew nothing about aliens or ufos but i had had a fear reaction in a workshop (about 1982 or 3) she gave in which she gave us relaxation inducements. all good until she said, \"you are a child, laying in a field of flowers and there is a little cloud above you..\" and i jumped up screaming, \"it's not a cloud!\" so she took me back in a session (later at her house) and i didn't remember any more details except on the tape i am speaking with a pronounced texas accent (which i had tried to get rid of, living in canada). on the tape she says, \"and even though you were asleep, you remember what happened to you then.\" i sorta remembered her induction but i never heard that part until i replayed the tape. i just lay there breathing until she brought me out. there were fragments (and i am somewhat leery of hypnosis)in which i said that i associated the color deep green with whatever i contacted and also that my impression was that it\\he was not comfortable here on earth - the air the gravity, whatever. that's it. the other incidents could be spoken of too. i was not always stoned; in fact that was probably the turning point of getting that stoned. i graduated from college, worked as a nurse and eventually i got my master's degree in counselling here in canada. which is what i still do."],"Summary":"orange flashing light zigzagging low on horizon then sinking straight down","Date of the Event":"06/18/1966 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09292009-0001","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.673126","Date Submitted":"09/29/2009 01:43 UTC","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.512315,+-97.673126(19718)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19718) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19718.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19718.html"],"City":"Round Rock","Case Number":"19718","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Round Rock","There were no other sightings in Round Rock on or around June 18th 1966"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"06:00:00"}
