We saw white lights I'm the trees. These lights were pulsating and ascending very slowly in a strange formation and looked to be flashing at each other. Next we saw what looked to be one of our own stealth jets. It was beige with no lights but two jets firing from the back. The craft was triangular. We heard sonic boom. It seemed the jet went straight into the star like orbs. Last we saw a rotating craft in the trees. It was projecting many colors and moved in all directions."],"Log Number":"US-09202013-0011"}
