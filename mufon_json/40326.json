The photos were taken at 12MP. when I reviewed the downloaded photos I had captured what appeared to be a black triangular shaped object in front of the moon. looking closely it appears that there are appendages at the rear of the triangle pointing down. I observed no lights (navigation etc) no engine noise and the object was not noticed by the human eye. it must have been moving quickly and had been captured by the cameras shutter at just the right moment. I am unsure what the object is. The black line at the top of the photo is a telephone line."],"Latitude":"42.364242","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
