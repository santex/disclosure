That is when I seen this object suddenly, appear out of the sky dropping its altitude so fast the the amount of G forces would have killed a human, then it came to a complete stop at around 800 ft(hard to tell how high it was and how far) above ground, and just as fast as it had stopped it shot off to the east. What baffels me is that there was no sound and how fast it moved. I just wish there was someone who seen what I seen that night"],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Colorado","Summary":"Falling object stops, makes 90 degree turn then moves again.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15604.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15604.html"],"City":"Aurora","Case Number":"15604","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Star-like","Log Number":"US-02192009-0017","Longitude":"-104.82867","Date Submitted":"08/23/2007 09:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.730992,+-104.82867(15604)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15604) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/23/2007 09:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.730992","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
