{"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i were taking our dogs outside around 7:30pm cst, while observing the few stars\\planets not drowned out by the nearly full moon. while looking at jupiter, 5 minutes later, i noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving underneath it, from south to north. it was a star-sized white light, and living a mile from the regional airport and numerous military airfields, i am confident saying it was probably not an aircraft. i say it resembled a satellite because we've seen the iss, space shuttle, hubble, and other large objects in orbit passing at their prescribed times. this particular \"satellite\" passing by jupiter seemed to light up, or appear, while on a staight trajectory to the north, nearly 45 degrees from the eastern horizon. it's path lasted only about 5-10 seconds, before it went dark. it was far too slow to be a comet or shooting star, and too fast for a plane at that distance. after it disappeared, i followed the same speed and direction visually, to see if it would reappear, but it did not return. i began to describe it to my wife, who had not seen it. while i pointed towards jupiter and motioned the direction of what i saw, an additional light appeard about 70-80 degrees up in the eastern sky, just a few \"inches\" above jupiter, moving in south-southeast heading. my wife instantly saw this other \"satellite\" which we both describe as a star- or satellite-like white light, moving quickly and deliberately. the part that caught my attention, is that the second object, continued on a path that intersected the path of the first object, just seconds later. it continued traveling south-southeast for another minute or so before also just fading away. i have heard that there are many satellites that cross paths, and nearly miss often. but, minutes later when i checked the satellite tracker for our area, no satellites are to pass for another four nights from now! in the past several months, we have noticed, to our suprise and awe, lots of \"runaway stars\" in the night sky between 8-10 pm. most are mundane, but some change directions. tonights objects were intriguing because of their apparently close proximity, and the fact that no satellites were scheduled to be passing over. i have seen hundreds of shooting stars, and these objects were both not shooting stars. i suppose they could be top secret super-sonic high alt. military planes, but they are not very top secret if they have blaring white lights on them. i will keep my eyes to the skies watching these \"moving stars\" at night, as we see them quite often from our backyard."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.428019,+-87.207105(19775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19775) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/02/2009 07:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19775.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19775.html"],"City":"Pensacola","Date Submitted":"10/02/2009 09:46 UTC","Log Number":"US-10022009-0009","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"19775","Latitude":"30.428019","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-87.207105","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"two objects looking like satellites crossing paths within seconds before disappearing","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Pensacola","There were no other sightings in Pensacola on or around October 2nd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
