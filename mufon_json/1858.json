I noticed what I at firstthought was a falling star. I told my husband and he said it was not fallingbut was in horizontal flight. It was neon green and was traveling at a highrate of speed, and had a streak(trail) of light behind it. My husband said ithad to be moving at appx. 700-800 mph. He also said it was at lest 2,500 feetup, but appeared to be the size of a football. It went behind the clouds for abrief second and you could still see the neon green glow even behind the cloud. It then appeared in the clear sky once again, and then it was gone in a second. It never appeared to be at an arch like a falling star, and it was definitely ona straight path to the E-SE direction."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1858.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1858.html"],"Region":"Wyoming","Weather Factors":"Windy","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","City":"Gillette","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"","Date of the Event":"09/06/2002 08:30 UTC"}
