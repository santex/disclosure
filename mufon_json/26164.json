I thought it was a tractor in a field. Then it changed color to green and I thought it was a stop light, but it was in a field. When I came even with it, it changed to a florescent blue and shot straight up in the sky. I've seen these before but never that close. I called my wife and told her to report it right away. Just in case. Contact me on my cell if you want. The company I drive for is out of Butler, Indiana, and I am often driving on this road."],"Log Number":"US-10282010-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bremen","There were no other sightings in Bremen on or around October 28th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.449336,+-86.143228(26164)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26164) map </A>","Latitude":"41.449336","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Windy","Tags":"City","Case Number":"26164","Summary":"While driving west on Hwy 6, saw out right window round red flashing object","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","City":"Bremen","Region":"Indiana","Date Submitted":"10/28/2010 07:59 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown"}
