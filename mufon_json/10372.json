I saw two again today spaced about 45 minutes apart. I did look periodically throughout the day on my lunch and regular breaks from work, but only saw the two and they were both heading to the South at a leisurely pace again...however the thing is, I KNOW that these objects are just popping up in the sky out of seemingly nowhere because I can cover the entire visible sky in a few seconds visually and suddenly in a spot in the sky that was empty just a second earlier, one of these star-like things show up in it, usually it just sits there for a few seconds and then starts to move. I see other regular aircraft flying at about the same altitude, but they usually leave a contrail and are identifiable, unlike the star-craft things. Something is going on here over Phoenix and I would sure like to know what the hell it is..."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Wow...Why am I seeing UFO's almost every day over Phoenix ?
