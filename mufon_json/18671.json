{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailsthis was the news report Dozens of residents of Canada���s capital city, ottawa ontario and nearby Gatineau, Que., witnessed an object streak across the night sky at about 10pm local time july 27th 2009 Monday night and crash into the Ottawa River with a ���thunderous boom.��� The object had lights on it and appeared to change course several times, like a small plane struggling to stay airborn, before it hit the water. It was such a sight that emergency rescue and search crews in the area sprung into action and began searching the area using sophisticated sonars and underwater cameras to try and figure out what the object was. Even helicopters from the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) in nearby Trenton took part. On Tuesday at 1:30pm, they discovered an object about 9 meters (30 feet) below the surface, but because of currents and nearby rapids, sending divers down would be extremely dangerous since they would be instantly swept away by the currents. The mystery? Authorities and residents have no idea what this object laying at the bottom of the river is. There are no planes missing from the area, no other aircraft like helicopters, etc. are missing. There is no derbis, no oil slick and even space agencies that were contacted said nothing disappeared from orbit. On Tuesday afternoon, ottawa police Const. Alain Boucher said of the object they found on the riverbed: ���The size and the shape doesn���t lead us to believe it���s any piece of an airplane or fuselage or anything like that. It could be a rock, it could be a bunch of logs stuck together, it���s hard to say. No one has come forward with any kind of videos or anything like that at this time. None of the people actually reported seeing a plane go down at the same time.��� But the fact still remains - something fell into the Ottawa River Monday night that prompted a massive co-ordinated search by local authorities and the Canadian Military. They found an object below the surface and don���t know exactly what it is. It truly is a UFO mystery at this point."],"Summary":"ufo crashes into ottawa river","Log Number":"CA-08142009-0016","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There was one other sighting in Ottawa on or around July 27th 2009"],"Case Number":"18671","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Date Submitted":"07/27/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.42847","Date of the Event":"07/27/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ontario","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Ottawa","Longitude":"-75.690443","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18671.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18671.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.42847,+-75.690443(18671)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18671) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
