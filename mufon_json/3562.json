The two lights (red and green) first made me notice the object. First thought maybe it was just a small airplane but as it got closer and was above us, I noticed a third light(yellow)and it seemed to be triangular in shape. It was about 100 - 150 ft above us moving very slowly and making NO sound. I told my son to get the camera so he could take a picture of the object while I turned the car around to follow it. Once we turned around, the object had sped up to a great speed making it impossible to catch up."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.471065","Country":"United States","Latitude":"35.657322","Case Number":"3562","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/09/2005 10:28 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/09/2005 10:28 UTC","Log Number":"US-07102005-0002"}
