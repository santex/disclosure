I was in the back seat watching Ancient Aliens on my iPhone when both of my parents got my attention. They pointed out a boomerang shaped object with four bright white lights decending in a sharp acute angle. It had to be decending in an angle between 15 to 20 degrees. The object decended in such a manner that seems impossible for a plane to do. This all occurred in about 30sec around 8:30pm. When we first way it we believed it to be an airplane but we noticed it did not have any navigational lights and it was decending in a very steep, almost verticle angle. We were dumbfounded. It is hard to explain the emotions I felt as I watched the object. It happened so fast yet time felt like it was going in slow motion. We lost sight of the object as it decended behind the tree line."],"Region":"North Carolina","Date Submitted":"11/26/2011 10:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.076265,+-80.289608(33627)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33627) map </A>","Latitude":"36.076265","Date of the Event":"11/26/2011 08:15 UTC","City":"Winston-Salem","Source":"MUFON"}
