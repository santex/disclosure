{"Country":"Canada","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt the above date, time, and location, the writer was at work when he noticed a large object hovering in the sky. It appeared to be black in colour, and looked to be triangular in shape, with multi coloured lights on the underbelly. I called my fellow colleague over to take a look, he was convinced, as was I, it was a UFO! Before long there were over 20 people watching this object hover in the sky, many people were taking pictures, and recording video of this unknown object. The object would move when planes were flying by, but stayed stationary for about 20 minutes, then it flew away slowly heading south towards lake Ontario. Nothing further to report at this time."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42255.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42255.html"],"City":"Toronto","Date of the Event":"09/02/2012 08:16 UTC","Log Number":"CA-09032012-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.781664,+-79.402396(42255)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42255) map </A>","Latitude":"43.781664","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around September 2nd 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/03/2012 12:43 UTC","Case Number":"42255","Region":"Ontario","Longitude":"-79.402396","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Black object shaped like a triangle with multi coloured lights on the underbelly hovered over a few large buildings for over 20 minutes, then it took off."}
