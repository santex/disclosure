We went out and I could see a pretty good light through the tree's and which I could not see with the naked eye and as I fined tuned the goggles I noticed the ball of light was greater then anything I had seen. It looked as big as the moon behind the tree's. It was overcast and the moon comes in the east and the moon is only a quarter full. Right before we lost sight of it, it seemed to move to the east then disappeared. Like it took off."],"Log Number":"US-03122010-0001","Summary":"Ball of light in Tree's","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.869734,+-123.711108(22264)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22264) map </A>","Case Number":"22264","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Fog, Light","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.869734","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Leggett","There were no other sightings in Leggett on or around March 11th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22264.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22264.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/12/2010 01:25 UTC","Longitude":"-123.711108"}
