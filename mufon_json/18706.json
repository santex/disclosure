She goes outside on our deck to smoke every night. She was having a cigarette about 1:AM. She was still outside when I came home. She told me she saw a UFO and she pointed to Jupiter. I pulled out my cheap telescope and showed her that it was a planet. We went to bed and forgot about it. On Saturday morning she showed me the videos that she took. I couldn't believe what I saw. I still don't know what to think. Please review this AVI and let me know what it is. It is definitely a pentagon shaped object. We have a good amount of footage but it is all pretty similar. Except for what she took at the end. I think it may have been just a quivery light."]}
