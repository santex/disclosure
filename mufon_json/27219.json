The sky was clear. Not a cloud. At first we thought it was a planet, but it was really bright. It seemed to change shapes as if rotating. It stayed in view as we turned East, it seemed to go behind us, then when we went North onto Library Road it moved. The object grew bigger until it was an inch big , it created a huge bright halo of light behind it. I commented that it looked like an angel in the shy, one of those you see on a Christmas Tree. It was still there when I pulled in my home, but was gone when I went to the third floor to see it."],"City":"South Park Township","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.289792,+-80.009774(27219)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27219) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/03/2011 05:41 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"It looked like two small objects together, on top of each other small triangle then big","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27219.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27219.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01032011-0002","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in South Park Township","There were no other sightings in South Park Township on or around January 3rd 2011"]}
