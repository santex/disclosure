At first I thought it was a plane but it was moving pretty fast. After about a minute of watching it, the unidentified flying object was to the right of my window and a second white, circular light appeared fairly close and parallel to the first one. After 30 seconds that second light disappeared and by that time it was behind me. This was one of the most interesting things I have ever seen, it was definitely not a plane or a helicopter and I started to think maybe it was some toy a kid was playing with but quickly realized that it was probably too dark for a kid to be playing and the object was moving relatively fast, faster than an airplane in the sky and achieved a great distance while i watched it. When I lost sight of it I was passing the Flat Irons Crossing mall (on my left) and the object was to the right and behind me."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere"}
