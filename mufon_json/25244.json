I thought it was a plane at 1st but then realised it was 2 bright so I turned out... the light and opened the window so I could see it better, there was no sound, it was quite close, had no wings, was travelling quite fast and then it faded away up into the sky rather quickly. There are NO clouds in the sky so didn't dissapear behind any clouds. I always have a scepticle eye over these things but I'm at a loss to explain this one, I have seen similar things before but in the distance, this time was close then dissapeared in seconds into the sky..."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25244.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25244.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-1.677623","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25244","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Morpeth","There were no other sightings in Morpeth on or around August 30th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Morpeth","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Bright light low then faded into space.","Log Number":"GB-08302010-0010","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=55.17366,+-1.677623(25244)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25244) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/30/2010 07:07 UTC"}
