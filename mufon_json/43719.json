I noticed a bright orange light on the western horizon. The object was an orange glowing orb with no blinking lights. It was self-illuminated. It travelled from West to East, coming from over the Pacific and flying toward the mainland. I called my wife to bring her camera and she took 5 photos and a video. When we looked at photographs she took of it, it looked like crazy worm-like snapshots with a bright orange color. With the naked eye it appeared to be travelling smoothly, but with the digital camera zoomed-in, the behavior was extremely erratic, as the video shows. I immediately checked the location of the ISS and found that it was on the day-side of Earth over Russia. It disappeared behind cloud-cover on its way East."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43719.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43719.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Longitude":"-123.963964","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Nanaimo","There were no other sightings in Nanaimo on or around November 4th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
