We have visitors who are revealing themselves to us. And they are working hard to get our attention in the skies. Our friends are all over the world showing themselves and the crafts they fly. Our technology does not have the capability to travel like they do. They are far more advanced then we are. I believe they are monitoring are daily activities and watching movements. For some reason they will not leave. I think humans are comming to the crossroads of self extinction and firmly believe they are here to prevent it. Sometime in the near future they will land and organize a better world so man kind would get along better. If man does want to change , I think we would have no alternative with them here. Its a peaceful warning from them. Please adhere. They are here to spread the message of peace.
