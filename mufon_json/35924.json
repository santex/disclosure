At first i thought it was a plane since its normal to see them around here, but as it keep moving forward the light got stronger and brighter so i noticed it wasnt a plane considering that planes haver red, white blue lights flashing. When the light was almost in front of my bedroom window it blink twice and then dissapear. After that i went running downstairs to get a camera and got back to my room hoping to see something else, and i was really lucky cause a couple of minutes later the light appear again near from where i saw it the first time and then it kind of follow the same path but this time it was like descending until it look like it went behind some houses."],"Date Submitted":"02/19/2012 01:07 UTC","Country":"Costa Rica","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"CR-02192012-0004","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.052754","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=9.950694,+-84.052754(35924)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35924) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Guadalupe","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35924.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35924.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/18/2012 08:00 UTC","Latitude":"9.950694","Summary":"A light in the sky that appear a 2 times","Region":"San Jose","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
