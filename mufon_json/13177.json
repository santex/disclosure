{"Log Number":"ES-10222008-0023","Summary":"2 ufos like 3 light circle each one.","Country":"Spain","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/15/2008 11:22 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI diden���t believe, now i���m an sceptic. Anyway this is what me and my girlfriend see: I was with my girlfriend in my home, an atic in Valencia city center, spain, in June. It was about 11 pm and we was watching tv. Then we ear an small aeroplane flying abobe and low (cesna tipe) and we go outside to the terrace to see it. We see the plane with the position lights going from south east to north west. there was hight clouds and the sky looks yelowish because city lights. we stay looking at the plane until it was far away over the city buildings. Then we saw two pair of tree circle lights appearing at the same altitude of the plane, from the right (north) going toward the plane. I realize about some facts that make me think these two objects was not planes or copters. In the first place the tree lights of each object were palid yelow an circular, two lights in the botton, and other in the top, like a triangle. the lights of the objects were not flashing, like the cesna lights, and not red green like in a plane. More odd was that the object lights were perfec circles, not common lights with that you see with filaments (like the cesna lights). Also the two objects were flying around the cessna right and left, and right, and the lights configuration never changed. If the lights were placed in wings the perspective would make change the triangle in the rotations, but in this case, the triangle have the same visual configuration, no matter wich movement the objects make, also them change direction too quick for a plane. The cessna plane looks not to realize the objects were there, or if the pilot see it, he not chage the course and follow straight. About two minutes after the objects appear they go away for the right (north). The following days i was searching in press for some report, but i cant find nothing. That���s all about this observation.
