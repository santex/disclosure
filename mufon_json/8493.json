It was not a star. It was not another planet. I got hi powered binoculars and looked....it appeared to be a space vehicle of some sort and I could discern bright red lights on top and on bottom. At times the space vehicle object seemed to have an orangey glow. I watched it for several hours. I've never seen an object which appeared to be so close to the moon. I could not discern its speed, direction etc. It was too far out. It was not there on the next night November 30th, nor did I see it on November 28th. Only on 29th. I do not believe it was the International Space Station......I don't think the ISS was orbiting almost directly east of Northern California, the San Francisco Bay Area. When I first noticed this space vehicle object I questioned 'what the heck is that by the moon?'....I thought it might be an asteroid because it was so brilliant and bright and large!! Then I remembered the night before there was nothing next to the moon like that. I got my hi powered binoculars to look. The red lights were very discernable on this object. This was not an airplane."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11282007-0002","Case Number":"8493","City":"Dublin"}
