It was early and quiet in the morning. I was looking out of the window, when I realised there were three strange disk-like shapes in the sky. Those objects weren't moving and were pretty big for a bird or a plane, so my thought was it had to be UFOs. I was really excited by this phenomenon. I decided to take a photo to observe it more closely. Looking back I saw there were also lights on them. Two UFOs were close together and one in a distance. The one in a distance was more detailed. As I kept driving on, I lost the view of the objects."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13864","Date Submitted":"08/24/2008 09:12 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"51.586295","Source":"MUFON","Country":"The Netherlands","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00"}
