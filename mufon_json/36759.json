{"Longitude":"-119.746029","divs":["sighting detailsas i walked outside of my condo to have a smoke around 10-10:15 pm on friday march,23 2012 in sparks nevada i happened to look to my left (east) and i noticed three slow moving unusually bright lights that were white and had a super slow extended bright flash and did not have any other colored lights such as the red and green lights that you would see on aircraft, at first i thought that they were perhaps three large individual aircraft's like those double rotor helicopter but i quickly discounted that because they are extremely loud and there was no noise, (not to say that they don't) but in all the years that i've lived here i have never seen a double rotor helicopter fly at night. i live directly under the flight path of the reno\\cannon airport and am well versed with aircraft that comes and goes in a northeasterly direction. i would also like to mention that i cannot every remember seeing any aircraft travel in the area of the siting especially at that altitude for that matter. i suddenly realized that whatever i was seeing appeared to be one object because they were moving together so perfectly, the lights were in a staggered or diagonal shape, the first light was about 500-1000 feet above the hills due east that make up the reno-sparks valley, then the second light was approximately 30 degrees up & behind the first and i give the same description for the third light in relation to the second light. as mentioned the lights were perfectly spaced and never seemed to loose there spacing and the lights were not typical looking at all in that they were super bright and had a very slow or extended brightness and yet the lights seemed to stay lit unlike a strobe, i also noticed that the highest of the three lights didn't get brighter but maybe once, really strange. at this point i yelled out for a family member to \"come check this out!\" then with a serious amount of adrenalin running through me i quickly i bolted upstairs to get my video camera and of course by the time i got back downstairs it was barely visible through trees and the larger than usual high tension power lines that run down sullivan lane."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Huge w/ 3 extremly bright lights w/ slow flash","City":"Sparks","Case Number":"36759","Region":"Nevada","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/26/2012 08:27 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.542611,+-119.746029(36759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36759) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03262012-0015","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Latitude":"39.542611","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Sparks","There were no other sightings in Sparks on or around March 23rd 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/23/2012 10:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Flash, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36759.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36759.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
