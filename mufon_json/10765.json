The shape of it looked unusual to me, so I grabbed my digital camera and went outside. The object wasn't moving, didn't make any noise. I pointed my camera at it, zoomed in as much as possible and took a few shots. I watched it for a couple of minutes, and it did not move at all. When I saw it, it looked white, almost like a glowing grain of rice in the sky, a dew degrees off-vertical from my viewpoint. I thought it was something relatively close by, not a star. My perception was it was maybe 5-7 miles away. After watching it for a whicle, I was tired so I went back inside and went to bed. The next day I transferred the pictures to my laptop and only one of them captured the object. I was surprised to see it was actually multi-colored (it appeared white to the naked eye). As you can see in the picture, if you zoom in 100%, stars show up without motion blur. This leads me to believe the multi-colored object also has little or no motion blur."],"Latitude":"37.401265","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"02/10/2008 03:03 UTC","Summary":"Saw multi-colored still object in the sky","Longitude":"-122.099722"}
