I assume. It was pink, yellow, and orange. My dog and I ran all the way home, and I told my husband, and I called a friend, and even emailed a sort of expert. I did not realize I could report it on here till now. It was falling towards New Hampshire. I live in Maine. My husband and I watched it fade out of sight. Likely a meteor, but it was pretty big looking. I never found any reports on it."],"Summary":"something falling through our atmosphere","Date of the Event":"11/16/2013 04:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52441.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52441.html"],"Longitude":"-70.703912","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"44.054249","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:09:00","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.054249,+-70.703912(52441)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52441) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/26/2013 11:43 UTC","Log Number":"US-11262013-0012","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bridgton","There were no other sightings in Bridgton on or around November 16th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"52441","City":"Bridgton"}
