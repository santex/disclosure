{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Quincy","Date Submitted":"07/03/2012 11:31 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsJust finished watching country club fireworks and walked with friends back to my nearby house. I saw a very bright orb appear in the southern horizon and observed it fly directly overhead before disapearing into the northern horizon. It was traveling very quickly and appeared to be on fire or giving off a firey trail. The object almost had a triangle or diamond shape, but was very distant. I know it was not a firework because of the distance traveled and I know it wasnt a plane because of the speed and color. It emmitted an almost flame like appearance that flickered a little but was a contant color. I know others had to see it, and my friends and I couldnt explain it."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07032012-0031","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.925923","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Quincy","There were no other sightings in Quincy on or around July 3rd 2012"],"Summary":"Firey Orb, traveled at extreme rate from horizon to horizon","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/03/2012 09:45 UTC","Region":"Illinois","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-91.379243","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40125.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40125.html"],"Case Number":"40125","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.925923,+-91.379243(40125)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40125) map </A>"}
