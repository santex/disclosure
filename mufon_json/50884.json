Very fascinated by the local changes in landscapes. As passing near Boise, I saw a flash, seemed like a huge vessel, slow down, and approach the horizon from my right as I was northwest bound in afternoon. I was shocked because sun was clearly still mid afternoon. I pulled off, just to watch. Vessel hovered for about 10 minutes, then took incredible change in speed and direction from hover. This vessel took off in a split second or not more than two to the left of my windshield. It made a huge checkmark in the sky, and was gone with no noise. Trails, and no other trace. I blinked and it was gone, not horizontally but vertically when it approached horizontily. Flight observed as characterized with north westerly, slowing to hover, then sudden exit of stratosphere, not directional associated with north, east, south, or west."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Idaho","Longitude":"-116.212847","Summary":"Visual track of ship hover and gone."}
