I live on the eastern side of the mountain in El Paso, Texas. Suddenly, I observed a bright glowing blue flying object over the mountain in an area that is not accessible. No roads, rugged terrain. It was moving quickly and different directions and even seemed to flip. It disappeared and instantaneously appeared so far south that nothing human could do that. It then appeared in the original location instantaneously again. There was nothing in the sky, as in planes, helicopters, etc. There was no way a human could have been flashing some kind of light there."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-106.445746","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.829708,+-106.445746(32938)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32938) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Other","Log Number":"US-10282011-0019","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around October 21st 2011"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Latitude":"31.829708","Summary":"Glowing blue spinning and moving rapidly. disappearing and reapearing a amile away instantaneously.","Tags":"City"}
