I was looking straight up at the stars when it came into view. It was traveling south to north and gliding at a i would say 30 mph rate. I think it is safe to say that it was probably 200ft-300ft above me. It was a perfect triangle shape with 5 white protruding circles on the bottom ( one at the tip and 2 on each side of it. The underbelly was clearly visible from my postion. It glided by with NO SOUND what so ever! I lost it after 6-7seconds. When it disappeared i ran inside to report. I have never seen anything like that in my life!!! It scared me and shook me up pretty bad!!"],"Date of the Event":"11/03/2010 08:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-11032010-0030","Latitude":"39.737842","Longitude":"-104.82242","Case Number":"26344","Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Object Features":"Dome","City":"Aurora","Date Submitted":"11/03/2010 10:36 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Aurora","There were no other sightings in Aurora on or around November 3rd 2010"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.737842,+-104.82242(26344)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26344) map </A>"}
