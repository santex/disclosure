The sighting took place about 30min after departure and leveled off at 36000ft ( FL 360 ) . We were three in the flight deck ( me , the first officer and a flight attendant ) and we suddenly saw a black cigar-shaped object crossing our path , about 1500 to 2000 ft above and about 500m ahead, from 5 to 11 o'clock and very fast ( perhaps mach 2 , we were at mach .80 ) , without any lights or contrail . I asked ATC about any crossing traffics , included military , and the answer was negative . I have never seen anything like that . I fly since 1992 ."]}
