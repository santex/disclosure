I could see 6 large domes that lined the bottom of the object 3 on each side. I immediately assumed these to be light's but was unable to tell as the object was not lit up... and had no sound. It drifted into the distance and disappeared. About 30 minutes later the object returned from the same path, same direction from the first sighting. It drifted off once more and disappeared."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"51406","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Summary":"Large V shaped oject, no light, no sound"}
