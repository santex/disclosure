I can see the Columbia river. I see planes every day and night across the water at the Portland air port. Anyway it was abot 1100pm give or take and I was looking towards the fort to see if I could see the fireworks. I then noticed the big dipper . then what caugt my eye was this light. it flew towards the bottom right corner star then just disappeared like it left our space then another then another then another. one more then nothing. I thought they must have watched the fireworks and are headed home. really that was my thought. end of story. I reported one that I had seen in the seventies in willams calif. these are the only unexplained things I have seen. these are both true and clearly no one will ever tell me different ever"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/11/2013 01:33 UTC","Summary":"4-5 yellow orange lights flying at the bottom tip of the big dipper . one after another flew and dissapeared","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There were 3 other sightings in Washington on or around July 4th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"48865","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","City":"Washington","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.898472","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 11:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48865.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48865.html"],"Log Number":"US-07112013-0005"}
