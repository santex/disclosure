{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving down Jericho Turnpike, I noticed a large object hanging just below a cloud. I pulled I to a parking lot to get a better view. Once stopped, the object pitched upwards 10-15 degrees. It slowly moved into or was enveloped by the cloud. I attempted to drive in the direction it was traveling, but it was gone. I had a problem getting my phone camera to load. I captured 3 seconds of the event. I do not have a drawing yet. I find it hard to draw."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York","Date of the Event":"07/18/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/10/2013 01:17 UTC","Case Number":"45123","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.324561","Summary":"Large object stationary.
