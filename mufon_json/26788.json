I thought, could that be a UFO, then this object came closer and became larger. As I was stopped behind the cars in front of me I stared at the object and thought what if the light began to expand and then the object grew 4 times its original size then went back to being a speck, then I passed under some trees and when I was back out it was gone."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
