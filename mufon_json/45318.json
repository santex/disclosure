Looked like a golf ball on fire kind of. Mostly red, but changed to orangish and even lighter almost whitish color. Didn't blink, just was like a burning ember. Watched it fly in straight path over top of my apt. building. Went inside and put pics on computer. Went back out on balcony and saw a second one going in and from same direction. What the heck they are I do not know!Video and pics not great, but these were pretty fast and I was pretty excited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45318.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45318.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/19/2013 07:25 UTC","Latitude":"39.047345","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-76.637441","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":[],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.047345,+-76.637441(45318)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45318) map </A>","Case Number":"45318","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-01192013-0012","Summary":"Red/Orange glowing orbs","Source":"MUFON"}
