{"divs":["Sighting Details Labor Day weekend 1976, as I was walking up Coast Highway in Ventura County. early a.m. I saw a red light several times on a power line between two poles directly opposite of me. The light was exactly like Stephan Spielberg first movie (Firelight). Also close encounters. The next night I was taken by police to Venture county airport, were I was taken to a Quonset Hut, where I may have seen an alien like in close encounters. I leaned to my right on a gurney and said \"I love you\" to the alien, but I was unable to make any sound. I was then taken to a State hospital for six weeks, and was told I couldn���t work for two years. Two months later I got a job as a Special Service Police Officer in San Francisco. In the spring of 1978 as I was going to sleep I had a strong shock in my forehead. I quit the Police Force because I had flash backs. There is much more to this story, if you are interested please contact me by phone or letter, I am a former State Section Director for Del Norte County California. Thank You, Frank E Johnstone"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Red light on power line, 24 hrs later, alien encounter at air port","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Other","Longitude":"-119.034402","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/06/1976 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"34.221224","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.221224,+-119.034402(13084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13084) map </A>","Case Number":"13084","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/06/1976 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10162008-0012","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13084.html"],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Camarillo","There were no other sightings in Camarillo on or around September 6th 1976"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Camarillo"}
