the date and time are not exact but i do remember it was that time of year when it would be getting dark earlier. i am guessing around sept\\oct of 1992 or 1993. my son and myself layed on the floor in front of the tv to watch a movie together while mom was at work. it was night time and dark. i am not sure how far into the movie it was but for some reason unknown to me i looked to my right out the front window. my line of sight was minimal and only in an upward angle above the row of conifers and below the eves of the house. i immediately saw 3 red lights either moving slowly down or moving slowly down and at a westward angle. in any event it was traveling where it would appear to go almost directly over my house or land in my front yard perhaps. this did not look normal. it appeared to be huge but i really couldn't judge how far away it was however it was fairly close and not way up in the sky. as i looked at it, flares came to mind but i rationalized there was no smoke, no flickering, not falling just steady red lights moving slowly. i got up put my hands and face to the window as to eliminate any glare or possible reflection in the window glass and confirming it wasn't flares. then i asked my son (3 yrs old) if he see's this. he replied \"yes\". there was what seems to be 30 feet between the tree tops and eves of the house from my angle so i know it was moving slowly. i ran to the back window for what reason i don't know maybe to see if there was anything behind the house,then went back to the front window and it was still there. i was getting a bit worried at this point and felt something wasn't right so i called my wife at work to the east and asked her if she could see anything in the sky towards our house. she looked and said \"no\". so i hung up. i am still seeing this out the window and being my first born child i was feeling more protective than curious sensing something was not right. today i wish i would have went outside to get a better look (i think). so at this point i called 911. with them on the phone i was still seeing this and only described it to them as \"3 lights coming out of the sky\" i am sure some time has passed by now but i was reacting pretty fast so i can't judge the amount of time that had passed. it seemed i needed immediate response. the 911 operator asked me \"what do you think it is\" my reply was \"ummm i dont know what it is\" reluctant to say anything that may sound stupid. actually ufo is not what came to mind while i was seeing this. i dont think the term ufo was a rational thought. i was just dumbfounded and in all reality i was preparing for fight or flight. not that it seemed threatening but i was highly protective of my son and this object's presence put some fear into me. to think about it, prior to this, ufo was something i would have laughed at if anyone told me the saw one, and if i had to describe one it would have been the typical disc flying saucer. i never heard anything or seen anything on tv that would have gave me this idea or description of a ufo. i was on the phone with 911 for awhile and was pacing the floor as the window wasn't that available with a corded phone. the operator repeatedly ask me what i think it is. i could not get anything out as to what i thought it was, only a \"ummm i dont know what it is\". during this time i was no longer watching out the window but rather pacing waiting for some answer's from 911 assuming they would do something. then the operator transfered me to someone whom i cannot recall. who also asked me what i think it is. all i could say is \"ummm i dont know what it is\". they took my name address and info. the last thing i remember is sitting on the couch on the phone. i have no idea what happened to the object where it went or what it was. the subject did not come up again and i cannot recall even remembering it the next day until some time had passed maybe 6-7 years when i was watching a show on tv one day and there was someone elses account described and shown exactly as i saw it. this was also when i realized the lights i saw were also a triangle shape and it did not alter from a triangle shape and it did appear dark within the triangle. it just did not register to me at the time that it was of importance to describe it as such. there was no doubt in my mind after i saw it described, that is what the same thing i saw, identical. i can still visualize it to this day. it has been 16 years or so and it still goes through my mind almost everyday. i only wish someone else would have seen it (my son at 17 said he remembers, but has no real reculection). and it leaves me wondering if it was explainable. on the other hand i cannot dismiss it. (it is a feeling that i know i saw it but noones going to beleive me without proof). i dont have a problem sharing this with friends or coworkers (if they exhibit open minds) and then only to find that they have stories to share also. so that tells me this is bigger than i could imagine and that provides some comfort that i am not crazy. a year or two prior to this i had another sighting with witnesses. two friends were at my previous home and for some reason unknown to me i walked out my front door looked straight up into the sky and very very high up there was a black triangle spinning in one spot. i pointed at it and asked my friends if they see it. they both saw it. i suppose it could have been a sattelite. it was a definent black triangle spinning fast, and must have been huge because it was way up there. we dismissed it and didnt pay any more attention. just wanted to share this. i know its not possible to get confirmation on what i saw but it is good to know there are people who do listen."],"Summary":"saw big trinagle shape with red light at each corner","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.82785,+-122.306391(23387)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23387) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23387.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23387.html"],"Log Number":"US-05212010-0001","Case Number":"23387","Latitude":"47.82785","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Longitude":"-122.306391","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None"}
