I haven't found much on the internet, so I figured I would try here- Saturday, October 9, 2010 between 10:30 and 11:00 pm Darlene W. was taking the dogs out before going to bed. She stood between the barn and the garage, shielding her eyes from a security light in the back yard, and looked straight up. The night sky was clear and the stars bright. This is when she saw a flash, remarking that it was like a camera flash, circular and about the size of a quarter. The flash was white and very bright, but only lasting the length of a camera flash. The flash was followed by another one in the same area, same size and duration, but light red in color this time. She was frightened by the experience and went inside. She got my Dad, Raymond W., to come outside and look at the sky with her. They both didn't see anything. She hasn't seen anything since. Thoughts about the flash were something colliding in space or a satellite reflecting light from the sun."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
