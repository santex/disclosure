It is hard to judge the scale of the object since it was dark, but it appeared to be just several hundred yards off the coast at about 40 degrees and ascending. The object eventually disappeared. It was hard to tell if it disappeared out of sight due to rapid descent or if the lights were turned off. After seeing this first object, we went in to get a camera and captured video of two more lights. A fourth followed after the two seen in the video. There is a white light in the video which is Venus. You'll see in the middle of the video that the top object moves to the right of the other."],"Date Submitted":"01/25/2012 10:36 UTC","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Newport Beach","There were no other sightings in Newport Beach on or around January 13th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.595828","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"35149","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/13/2012 08:40 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
