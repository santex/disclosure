After watching a program on fractal geometry , I've switched tv program but cannot now recall of what it was about as I begun to suddenly have a tension headache , so I was just was lying on the sofa , but my neck & head pain was getting worse plus I was getting chills, so I decided to go & close the window. 2. As I closed shut the window I haven't noticed anything & was about to go to the other window to close that one as well, when suddenly I've turned on my heel & wend back to the 1st window & gazed up into the night sky. And all of a sudden the 1st ship manifested it self , at that point I thought it was my fever but a 2nd one appeared & then a 3rd one above those two ! 3. At that point it was obvious it was them , I smiled & said \" hi guys\" , at which point the lights started flushing together rhythmically , (perhaps some kind of Morse code signal ?). I stood there for about 6 or 7 min. Thought of photographing the ships but to be honest didn't think the photos would turn out as it was night time. Even though they were still stationary in the sky I left the window , glanced at the clock & it was 3:01 AM, I took a sip of water , than sat down on the sofa staring at tv & pondering this event as well weather I'll feel better by the morning as I wanted to go to the protest. As I was thinking this my TV went OFF ! I was stunned & took this as a 'no' sign. Tv stayed off for about 2 min. So just as I got up to go & look again if the ships were still there the tv turned itself back on , lol ! & yes they were still there so I've watch them for about 4 min. & after I left. Approximately 20 min. after that I went back to see if they still hover there but no , all 3 ships were gone. 4. At first it seemed as if white vapor & than the clear outline shape was visible & actually for brief moment a windows like could be seen , then the lights came on . Some were white, blue & one golden color . The full moon above & to the side of these really nicely illuminated them. 5. As I've said already I wasn't feeling well & neither later or the whole Saturday I spent in bed feverish (so I was prevented of going to the protest after all) , only late Sunday I started feeling well again. 6. As I've mentioned I walked away from the window so I did not see them leave . I'm attaching a quick sketch of this sighting & yes they were as big as I drew them compared to the the windows of that building ."],"Log Number":"CA-06282010-0002","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23999_submitter_file1__100_0972.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23999.html"],"Case Number":"23999","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Other"}
