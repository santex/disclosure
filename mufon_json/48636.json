Then the object instead of falling like a dud firecracker, started to elevate. I used a pair of Barska binoculars (10x50WA) used for aircraft spotting, and have a description of a glowing pulsating craft. It has a sweptback boomerang wing, a stubby triangular top section, but then the 'fuselage' is like the bottom keel on a sail boat; it streches down and is a right triangle in appearance. It glows yellow -orange, and it did a bank right toward the east above the protected wetlands area, heading near US-2. This was around 9:57pm PST, South east in direction, heading east toward US-2. It hovered and course corrected 2 mins into the 4 min flight, until I could no longer see it past trees."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:58 UTC","Region":"Washington","Longitude":"-77.034226","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 01:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48636.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48636.html"],"Object Features":"Wings","Summary":"Spotted ascending from trees, SE from house 125 degrees.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.904712,+-77.034226(48636)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48636) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00"}
