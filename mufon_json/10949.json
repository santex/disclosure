Well I was just outside and watching a plane fly over the city and sure enough there was my star-like UFO way up, probably around 50-60 thousand feet over Phoenix. I only noticed it because it was blinking on and off in a regular manner and then after about 10 minutes of observing it, the UFO just winked out of existence. I really hope that this means that I will be seeing these UFO's again on a daily basis. I wonder what they are doing during the daylight hours over Phoenix? Keep your eyes trained on the skies and maybe you will get lucky too !"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.450997,+-112.068557(10949)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10949) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around May 28th 2008"],"Summary":"They're baaaaack !!!
