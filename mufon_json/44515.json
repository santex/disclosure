Startled, I thought wait, these stars are not supposed to be here! Then I realized they were moving slowly to the west. I shouted to the wife to come outside and look and she came and we both just went crazy. As they moved, we looked at them in the Buschnel 10x50 widefield binoculars as well as in my LX200-12\" Meade telescope. Even with just our eyes, these things were HUGE. They were round globes, 27 in all. Glowing very bright. As bright as the star Sirius. If I had to estimate thier diameter, I would say at least a mile wide each one. They moved from directly south about 15 degrees above horizantol taking 20 minutes or so, never breaking formation and finally ending up what seemed to be right over the capitol building area in Phoenix to our North West where they just slowing disappeared from view. Never moving again just slowly getting dimmer until they were all gone!"],"Longitude":"-112.000106","Case Number":"44515"}
