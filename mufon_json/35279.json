It was dark but I could see the mountian range directly ahead. To the right of the road was a set of Red and blue lights with the blue light about 5 feet of the ground, The red light was about 20 feet directly above it. The two lights began to spin on a vertical plane about a horizontal axis. From my vantage point in the car the two lights became a circle of lights about 20 -30 feet in diameter. The lights then just disapeared. Then seconds later from behind me and came directly over my car at a high altitude was a streak of light (Like a shooting star). The light went over the mountian ahead of me. From over the ridgeline light radiated out at the summit in rays of silver-gold glittery lights. About 5-6 rays and it looked like the crown of the statue of liberty. Within seconds it was all over. please do not contact me"],"Tags":"City","City":"Eureka","Date of the Event":"10/01/2011 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/26/2012 09:23 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.514806","Region":"Nevada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.514806,+-115.95198(35279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35279) map </A>","Case Number":"35279","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35279.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35279.html"]}
