Something disturbed a possum which jumped out of a tree and ran across the roof above me. I then heard what sounded like an unusual sonic hissing and crackling sound - I can't describe it exactly. I looked out the window, and my attention was drawn towards a tall tree. Behind the tree there was a rotating ring of light, just hovering, and not doing much else. My heart has never pounded so fast in my life. I was too frightened to get out of bed to have a closer look because I didn't want to draw any attention to myself and was too frightened to even want to fall asleep. It made a hissing and crackling sound again, but it seemed more faint. This whole event went on until after dawn. I was I hoping the thing would go away and disappear when I heard a car drive up the street. But it was still there when I peeked out the window. Around 6am I finally went to sleep - for about two hours, and had a terrible day at work. The object was not there when I woke up."],"Date Submitted":"01/14/2010 04:43 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"None, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"","Tags":"City","Case Number":"21484","Log Number":"AU-01142010-0001","Longitude":"149.1009","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"ACT","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-35.3454,+149.1009(21484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21484) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"-35.3454","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, Unknown"}
