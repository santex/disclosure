The lights were orange as they came toward me and as they passed, which occurred very quickly. The objects came into and disappeared from view on the western horizon all within a couple minutes. Unfortunately, I was too mesmerized to use my camera on my phone. Two others with me, also saw them and were equally as puzzled. I can't really say how high they were, but, I'm guessing they weren't any lower than 5-10,000 feet due to the fact that there is a municipal airport (Hooks) to the south of our location, but they were much too high to be coming from there. Also, the glide path for Houston Intercontinental is just to the north and east of here, and the lights were not in the normal path of landing for that either. The object(s) made no discernible noise and the colors didn't really seem to change in brightness or hue. I'm pretty certain this wasn't an airplane from either of the two airports, because I've heard and seen many of these, and this was nothing like them."],"Longitude":"-95.607005","Country":"United States"}
