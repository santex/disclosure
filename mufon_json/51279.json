This past week, an object has shown up several nights in the Western sky and has hovered for quite a while before disappearing. Tonight,I went outside to see if the object had returned. The weird thing was that as soon as I went out my front door, the object pulled up as if it were a car stopping at a 3-way stop. I first viewed the object with my weak binoculars and then commenced to take a picture. I started to take a second picture, but the object vanished! This amazed me as this object, as well as previous objects, have hovered around for several hours in the past. During this sighting, a commercial airplane passed by the object; I live near the flight path of Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Kentucky","Summary":"really strange ufo occurrence in Campbell County, KY","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Fort Thomas","There were no other sightings in Fort Thomas on or around October 2nd 2013"],"Log Number":"US-10022013-0023","City":"Fort Thomas","Case Number":"51279","Date of the Event":"10/02/2013 07:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.079961","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.079961,+-84.440863(51279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51279) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.440863","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/02/2013 11:26 UTC"}
