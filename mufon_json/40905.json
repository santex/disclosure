{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting Detailsi heard a jet pass overhead . i glanced up at it,while i was looking at the jet i saw what looked like a large box tumbling. at first i thought it was falling, but it did not seem to be losing altitude. i watched for a minute or two then went to get binoculars. when i got back, only about 20-30 seconds,i could not find it again.i guess i am reporting this to see if anyone else saw the same thing. i am 52 and this is only the second time in my life i saw somthing that i did not understand what it was. it really looked like a large refrigator box but it was very small. a asprin would cover it at arms length. i just cant shake the idea that i might have seen somthing un-explainable"],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Winchester","There were no other sightings in Winchester on or around July 1st 2012"],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40905.html"],"Case Number":"40905","Longitude":"-78.205878","Summary":"it looked like a large cardboard box , tumbling","Date Submitted":"07/18/2012 05:23 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/01/2012 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.19483,+-78.205878(40905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40905) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.19483","City":"Winchester","Log Number":"US-07182012-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Virginia"}
