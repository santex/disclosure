As I stood facing the car, I saw a large, single, reddish orange ball in the sky. I first saw the large object approaching from the west at about about 40 degrees above the horizon...over rooftops. I was shocked by what I saw and immediately wondered if it were a plane on fire- engulfed in flames. I dismissed this thought as the object did not descend and made no noise. About 10 to 30 seconds elapsed. I got my wife to come out of the house to see it. When she came outside, another 30 seconds had elapsed. My wife, daughter and grandkids saw the objest. My daughter mentioned that she had heard reports that meteor showers were expected, but seeing this object, she and I agreed that it was moving too slowly and its form too round to be a meteor. It seemed to shift to a south-easterly direction in its flight. For the three minutes or so I could see it, it never changed colors and appeared to maintain its speed. It's speed seemed to be a bit slower than the planes landing and taking off at the airport which is nearby. I've never seen anything like this. I lost sight as it moved southeastward over nearby housetops."]}
