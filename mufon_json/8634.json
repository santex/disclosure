I NOTICED THROUGHOUT MY YOUNGER YEARS FROM TIME TO TIME (AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR SINCE 14) THAT A UFO WOULD BE FOLLOWING ME. ORBS, SAUCERS AND EVEN CIGAR SHAPED CRAFT. AT A CERTAIN POINT I REALIZED THEY WHERE INTENTIONALLY REVEALING THEMSELVES TO ME. WHEN I WOULD THINK, \"OH THAT WASN'T REAL\" THEY WOULD REAPPEAR TO AFFIRM MY DOUBTS AS FALSE! AFTER I MEET PROPHET YAHWEH I LEARNED TO CONTROL THIS PHENOMENA. WHENEVER I PRAY IN THE NAME OF YAHWEH FOR A SIGHTING THEY COME...THE ONLY TIMES THEY DON'T SHOW IS WHEN WE TRY TO IMPRESS PEOPLE, NON-PROPER WEATHER CONDITIONS, OR TOO MUCH AIR TRAFFIC!
