Actual Event: I was outside standing on my deck, watching the stars and the moon,between 1:30am-1:36am I saw the bright white light shooting away from the moon, it flashed once so it was like a decent gap between where the light was and the moon then it flash once more and it was gone, not a 3rd or a 4th flash. I know for a fact that an airlanes don't just turn their lighs off and the same with helicopters, and that they have more then one lights, I know other UFO's have multicolor lights but it was just 1 color 2 flashes."],"Date Submitted":"07/07/2009 01:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.511488","Longitude":"-75.390458","City":"Coopersburg","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18081.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18081.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/07/2009 01:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Coopersburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.511488,+-75.390458(18081)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18081) map </A>"}
