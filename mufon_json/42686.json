They are rarely not there. Sometimes there are many and at other times there are very few. We photograph mostly white ones with a few exceptions. For the most part I seem to need some light from somewhere. I can photograph at dusk without any light. Most of the time we don't know what we have until we view our photos on the computer. Sometimes when we view our pictures, especially one time, the computer went crazy. The computer has a hard time turning off and on. It looses the pictures too. We have many pictures of orbs but there seems to be something in common with many of them that we have noticed way off in the distance. I don't know what it is! We started photographing some of the orbs above the apex of the house. I tried to call them to me and, at the time, I didn't notice anything until we viewed them on the computer. Something is above me radiating multiple colored rays down to me. My husband tried to do this and he was unable. Shortly afterward my husband kept snapping photos and he caught this brilliant green orb. You will notice that in each of the progressive photos that the background is in focus but the orb is not. You can definitely tell that the orb is moving at a relatively fast rate of speed. I wish he could have picked it up from where it originated from."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42686.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42686.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09202012-0018","Longitude":"-120.545661","Date Submitted":"09/20/2012 10:46 UTC","Latitude":"43.808193","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.808193,+-120.545661(42686)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42686) map </A>"}
