I decided to go back to the photos I took that day, to see if I can find the ufo on pictures I took in the park, and sure enough, it was visible on two photograph backgrounds, taken about 30 minutes before I saw the thing right above me on my way back to the train station. What is interesting is that, based on the direction the ufo is coming from in these pictures, it made a hard right turn on the exact point where I took my photographs of it later (at Ipiranga CPTM station). The photos are as they were taken, I only added an arrow (with MS Paint) to point out the location of the ufo in the background."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"BR-07132011-0001","Date of the Event":"07/09/2011 03:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/13/2011 04:19 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Sao Paulo","There was one other sighting in Sao Paulo on or around July 9th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
