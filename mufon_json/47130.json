flickering thing go to it then circled around and went out of sight as if it had either gone behind or inside. the second one of these did the same but then flew right into it. the first one had stopped beside it, circling, then flew back the way it had come but slower. i looked at the time, it was 02:38. i was transfixed but saw nothing else and i went back to my desk. i wrote down immediately what had happened. i also drew a diagram, rough sketch to show the size etc. of it. at 03:10 i saw a helicopter appear in the sky directly south of the control desk and closer. it didn't seem to travel to this point and just appeared there suddenly. i thought it was the one that had gone inside that was coming out again. it was fairly close. about a week later i arrived at work to begin my night shift and one of the two staff there told me that a gas man was in the building. he was a tall and well built elderly man with light grey hair and glasses. he wasn't wearing a uniform, he had on a chequed brown and red shirt and plain light brown trousers.he said he was looking for gas. the hand held device he had had a needle that swung. he went upstairs to the office room that was locked and he came back down again. then he looked in all the cupboards and tried a few other locked doors. normally this would have set off the alarms but it didn't. i began to follow him around. i was certain he wasn't who he said he was. he said the next door neighbours had reported gas and pointed towards the west side of the building. even though this has the appearance of belonging to someone else it all belonged to our company. i found myself standing next to him at the south window. he told me that from time to time a large gas cloud appears over the town and nobody knows what causes it. the other two staff had seen and heard all this and they both picked up on the fact that we have no neighbours who could have reported it, they were quite shaken. i was told by someone at a utilities company i worked for a few years afterwards that a gas cloud would only ignite from the ground and they hadn't heard of any over the town. i am recording this because i heard of another sighting the day afterwards in europe somewhere."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Date Submitted":"05/02/2013 04:39 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet -
