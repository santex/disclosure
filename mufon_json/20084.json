{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy Fianc��� and I were taking a walk in town around 8:00pm. My Fianc��� said to me look at the moon, it looks like a smiley face. While walking down the sidewalk the moon was right in front of us. Then all of a sudden I look up and under the moon there was this bright light and it was pulsating. I said to her, that looks weird. The light would get brighter and then darker but not completely turning out. I looked at other lights in the sky to compare and they were blinking on and off, not up and down like a dimmer switch. Also while looking at this it seem like it was changing color. It was moving slowly in a straight line across the sky in the south east. Then it came to a complete stop for a second or two and then started moving again. Then lost sight of it behind the trees. It was weird to me because I never seen something like this in the sky pulsating, moving slowly, changing color and stopping and going. Don���t know but it was sure strange."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20084.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"20084","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.61707,+-75.485813(20084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20084) map </A>","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Allentown","There were no other sightings in Allentown on or around October 22nd 2009"],"Log Number":"US-10222009-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.485813","Date Submitted":"10/22/2009 09:21 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/22/2009 08:15 UTC","City":"Allentown","Summary":"Taking a walk, looking at moon and saw a pulsating light moving slowly under the moon.","Latitude":"40.61707","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
