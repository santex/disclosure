It was coming from the NorthEast towards the South. It continued on at a rapid rate of speed and seemed to have vanished into the clouds. Not 5 minutes later, a family member was watching out the South facing window of my home and said the lights were back, but there were 2 this time. The lights were headed West this time. Was nervous yet elated to see these lights. Honestly, we thought that they might be chinese lanterns and figured it is way too cold out and followed too straight of a pattern and traveled too quickly (without wind). Then, we told the little ones it was Roudolph so they would go to sleep! But, seriously there are three adults who witnessed these lights and found them to be odd and controlled."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.734315,+-84.553045(44757)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44757) map </A>","Case Number":"44757","Longitude":"-84.553045","Date Submitted":"12/24/2012 08:54 UTC","Log Number":"US-12242012-0008","Date of the Event":"12/24/2012 08:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.734315","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Lansing","There were no other sightings in Lansing on or around December 24th 2012"]}
