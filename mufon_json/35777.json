There were other helicopters in the area - and they did not compare. As we drove down Ball, the flying thing nearly passed over our car, we rolled down the window and it was SILENT - no noise, and the bottom of the craft was a matte black and flat - with what looked like a seam down the middle. It was hard to tell the shape but it looked triangular. Have never seen anything like it."],"Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"33.837223","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Lights prominent on top and to one side, silent, low to ground, flat surface on bottom","Log Number":"US-02132012-0089","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.837223,+-117.912494(35777)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35777) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"35777","Region":"California","City":"Anaheim","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There were no other sightings in Anaheim on or around February 10th 2012"],"Country":"United States"}
