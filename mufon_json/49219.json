It has happened several times. I didn't write the dates and times down. I just got the camera and took pics when we saw them. The night pics are when we were suppose to have the super moon. A bunch of orbs showed up in the photos like they were behind the clouds. There were no stars visible and the orbs are not in all the pics, but one pics seems to have at least 6 tiny orbs in it. I have a Nikon Coolpix 14.0 Megapixel with 3.6x zoom. I just set it on auto in day time and set it for sunset at night. The flash did not go off on any of the pics and I have not messed with photo shop. I just took all my pics off the cam and put them on the computer. I sent these because I can not zoom in close enough to see what they are. There were never any noises with any of the pics. My eyes are very bad so I can't tell what they are. My daughter was with me for all the pics. Hope y'all can zoom them in and tell me what they are. Thank You Amber Baker"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/27/2013 08:47 UTC","Longitude":"-87.28756","Case Number":"49219"}
