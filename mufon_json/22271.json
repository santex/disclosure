Saw again farther north 15 min later.","Latitude":"31.971309","Longitude":"-99.893923","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were driving north on Woodway Drive, going toward Loop 820 and Trail Lake Dr. in Fort Worth, Texas, when I looked up and saw a small disc shaped cloud that was stationary in the sky above us. It was shaped like a UFO, but in the form of a cloud. The wind was blowing around 33 miles per hour, it was very, very windy and there were no other clouds in the sky anywhere around the area. I pointed it out to my husband since I'm a big Coast to Coast listener, and I told him that I had heard that some UFO's will take the form of clouds. He and I were watching it and remarking how it wasn't moving at all when all at once it disappeared..poof it was gone. We couldn't believe it but continued driving north. About 15 minutes later we were on Forest Park Blve. near downtown when we saw it again, the same shaped small disc shaped cloud, but farther north and lower to the horizan. We had to make a turn and lost sight of it, but I really believe we may have seen something hidden as cloud in the sky."],"Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"03/12/2010 12:15 UTC"}
