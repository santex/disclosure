We thought at first it was a star or a plane, but then quickly realized it was too big to be a star or a plane. It was very bright and caught our attention. The object continued in the North Western sky hovering at times as it stayed in the sky and in our view for about 20 minutes. We noticed when it was hovering that the object was changing colors. Then it seemed to take off again in the flight path and quickly disappeared from our view off into the distance. It didnt have the flight path of a plane as when it was hovering it was very slow and then just took off much faster than a plane would be able to."],"Date of the Event":"05/08/2012 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"45.172927","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"05/09/2012 10:42 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38040.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05092012-0023","Case Number":"38040","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.172927,+-92.5899(38040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38040) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"UFO in North Western Sky","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","Region":"Wisconsin"}
