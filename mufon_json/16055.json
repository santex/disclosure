{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a warm summer evening in Lima, Peru. I (aprox. 14? years old) was playing soccer with my younger cousin at the third floor at home. Since rain is a seldom phenomenon in Lima, we don������t have many traditional covering roofs. So we were more or less playing \"out-door\". The ball was bouncing against the wall and coming back towards us. Suddenly I had a strange feeling of having to stop the ball and look up to the cloudless sky. My cousin stole me the ball and I kept looking up towards the sky. Nothing new up there for the moment, but in less than one second 3 glowing beautiful blue lights came from different directions and stopped just over my head making a triangular form. Now that I������m older I assume the distance between us was approximately 500-700 meters (1640-2296 Feet). They stood still some seconds and started to turn around the triangle axis with constant speed, with no signs of acceleration. I had to look up and couldn������t look down. It was like a hypnosis going on there. My cousin kept playing with the ball giving this happening no sign of interest. Suddenly they stopped without slowing down the speed, more or less than freezing a frame on a tv-dvd. They made one last blinking signal and dissapeared in a fraction of a second. Only the stars remained in the sky. I asked my cousin about what happened but he didn������t pay that kind of attention since he was very young and more interested in kicking the ball. Myself, I don������t have any explanation for this event. My dad worked at the airport in the jungle Peru������s and I know many different kinds of planes and helicopters. But this wasn������t any of those. They came and went as silent as a sneaking snake. It was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life... When I see videos in the net about ufos sometimes I recognize the same glowing formations that I������ve seen once there. I don������t feel that alone with my experience anymore. Yours, A.
