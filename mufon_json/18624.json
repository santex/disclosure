My co-worker was leaving our office at about 8:00 pm. It was already dark outside and she happened to glance up and saw a disc shaped object in the sky. The object had flashing lights. In our line of work we used Sony Madvica camaras and she was carriyng her camara at that time. She filmed the object for a few seconds. I've attached the image she recorded on her camara for your analysis. Note that the recording has sound aswell. Please share with me the results of your analysis if you find something intersting as I have no way to further anylize the image.
