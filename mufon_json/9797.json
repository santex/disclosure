what the #@%& is that!\" the craft paused, backed up, and then shot out into space dissapearing comppletely. the planes all began heading towards where it came from and where it went. we ran away screaming and excited about what we had witnessed. w made fun of my friend k and i after our last sighting (k was not present for any of this second experience). when we arrived back at the house w immediately appologized to me for giving me a hard time for the last one and stated that he is now a \"believer\". i still get a rush when i think about the events of this night. we were yelling so loud the whole time that i'm suprised that no neighbors called the cops on us. i would be shocked if no body else saw these events that night. someone else had to have saw it. i even almost called the police, but decided that they would probably think i'm just wasting thier time. besides, they would not have been able to do anything about it anyway. when j, w, and i told everyone about the second part we saw everyone was interested and we got no critiscism because they were able to admit that the first two objects were strange. my friends mother let the dog in the house and we noticed that the dog was acting strange and kept begging to go back outside (which is unusual behavior for him). the dog has been strange ever since and go outside much more frequently and for longer periods of time. i dont know if that could have anything to do with that sighting but it its wierd. for about 45 minutes after the sighting there were military planes flying around the area, some very low. (they looked like some sort of fighter jets and were silent, we could barely hear them even when the low planes passed over us. eventually the planes started heading nw and the air traffik lessened. but the activity from planes in the sky was still unusually high for the rest of the night. i still get a crazy rush from just the thought of our experience. the best part is how clear my memory is of this experience. the sighting lasted for a solid 10-15 minutes. this past week we started discussing a local legend about a ufo landing sight about three miles from the house(where we saw the ufos being chased) deep in the thick woods of the new jersey pinelands. according to j, wierd nj (a nj print about wierd stuff in jersey) has an article about this place (i tired looking for this aricle online but havent had any luck yet). the myth says that the trees are all pushed back in a perfect circle surrounding a 20 foot deep crater. the trees are suposed to be chipped up in spots on the tops of them not like a meteor hit but like a saucer landed there. story has it that when you try to take picturs of this crater your camera will die. j has been there and vouges for this story including the camera part. some of the guys and i went looking for it, but it was getting dark when we went and the trees were so thick that you could barely walk through them, not to mention that it is a swampy area. we also got delayed because were were caught sneaking across a golf course as a shortcut. i plan on making it back there soon and trying to get some pictures... hopefully! i will be sure to send them in. this article is about a different ufo landing in nj with witnesses in the 1960s: http:\\\\www.weirdnj.com\\stories\\_ufos02.asp if anyone saw this or knows anthing about these events please write in!!! we really want to know what we saw, there is no reason to be scarred to tell your story! people see these kinds of things all the time and im am so happy that i finally know that there is life elsewhere!!"],"Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9797.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9797.html"],"Case Number":"9797","Longitude":"-74.197919","Log Number":"US-03022008-0001","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Toms River","There were no other sightings in Toms River on or around February 25th 2008"],"Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.953729","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar, Circle, Disc","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","City":"Toms River","Date Submitted":"02/25/2008 09:05 UTC"}
