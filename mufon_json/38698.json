Friend was looking at the dark sky, couple stars a visible (to much light pollution). Friend pointed up \"Hey look\", he said. We both stared at watched it fly over. It made no sound, seemed to be at least over 1000 ft, however was very large in size, and was gliding across the sky pretty fast. Very smooth flight. The object was a black \"v\" shaped object with about 7 red, glowing lights. The lights reflected off the bottom surface of the object, making \"stripes\" along the path of the outer \"V\" shape. The object seemed to be at a high altitude, yet was large enough to see, and fast enough to only be in our vision for a few seconds. My friend and I looked at each other, our jaws agape. We didn't know what we saw, but we both agreed it was not a man made object (planes, heli, kite). The UFO flew past the treeline where we lost sight."],"Region":"North Carolina","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38698.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38698.html"],"trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Charlotte on or around November 30th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.730266","Source":"MUFON"}
