I never lost satellite radio reception and the antenna was on my dash. I should've lost radio reception seconds after it appeared. The fact I still had reception may be a clue to more about it."],"Object Features":"None","Summary":"triangle hovered over my truck as I drove","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-09212013-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.716003,+-74.003563(50963)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50963) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/21/2013 07:26 UTC"}
