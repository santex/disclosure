By the time i got up to get around tree it was long gone.I never would have seen it if it hadnt of moved it was camo'd by stars pretty good but when i locked my eyes on it,it was obviously a boomerang shape with lights.In my opinion exactly like they describe on history channel.It reminded me of a ship flying on star wars or star trek.Was totally silent. lIGHTS WERE PLACED ON CORNERS AND MIDDLES OF WING FROM WHAT I REMEBER.If our military cooked that up its awesome.AWESOME ONLY WORD FOR IT."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17259.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17259.html"],"Longitude":"-112.069517","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None, Wings","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"17259","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.454867,+-112.069517(17259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17259) map </A>","Summary":"Seen a boomerang craft at high altitude.
