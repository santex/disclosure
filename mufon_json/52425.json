Then, I sighted two objects moving very fast (probably around 750 mph). They both appeared very small, but were probably around 10 feet across. I could only tell that they were there because the sunlight (it was about 3PM) was reflecting off them. After watching them for about two minutes, the both stopped abruptly, then hovered for another minute, until one whizzed off incredibly fast (warping away?). The second one remained for a few seconds longer, before gradually shrinking into nothingness, perhaps it was ascending into space."],"Date Submitted":"11/25/2013 08:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.368001,+-71.050273(52425)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52425) map </A>","Region":"Massachusetts","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"52425","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-11252013-0012","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"06/10/2013 02:45 UTC","Summary":"Two strange objects sighted over Boston","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52425.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52425.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
