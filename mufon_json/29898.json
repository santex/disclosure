{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-90.738349","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were driving on highway 44 west near the Pacific exit. He noticed a string of lights that we first thought were airplanes. We pulled over and watched this string of lights traveling across the sky, a few would bunch up then go back in the line formation. My husband described them as a string of lights, maybe 20 lights, evenly spaced and the center had a vertical triangle of three lights; the string of lights was approx. 1000 feet long. We pulled over and watched them for a few minutes, then traveled on to the Washington exit where we turned onto Highway 100. Just prior to getting off the highway, we saw a helicopter turning from the exit at 44 and 100 back toward where we saw the lights. We hazard to guess that someone was sending up lighted baloons, but they were so high, and bright! There were fireworks going off up and down the highway, but this was pretty crazy looking and we have never seen fireworks like that! We tried to take a picture, but it was too far away."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 09:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"29898","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Pacific","There were no other sightings in Pacific on or around July 3rd 2011"],"Summary":"String of lights in sky","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.486428,+-90.738349(29898)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29898) map </A>","Latitude":"38.486428","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Pacific","Log Number":"US-07042011-0001","Date Submitted":"07/04/2011 12:08 UTC","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29898.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29898.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
