{"Log Number":"","divs":["Sighting Details I was on my way to work. I stopped at a stop signand noticed a bright light rising from the woods beside the road. At first Ithought it was a helicopter because it went straight up. There was no sound (mywindow was down). Two state troopers had stopped and saw it also. It rosestraight up and stopped. It had formed a triangle with two other lights. Atfirst I thought the other two lights were stars because they had not yet moved.After they had formed the triangle they moved together as one with lights ateach corner. I was able to follow them (or it) for about 7-10 minutes, until Ilost it inthe street lights."],"Date Submitted":"08/10/1998 10:00 UTC","Case Number":"1507","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/10/1998 10:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Medina","There were no other sightings in Medina on or around August 10th 1998"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1507.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1507.html"],"Region":"Tennessee","Latitude":"35.802845","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Longitude":"-88.774781","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Medina","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.802845,+-88.774781(1507)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1507) map </A>","Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw three lights form a triangle and fly as one un","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
