(I'm in broomfield). Then two of them veered off together, almost came to touch each other, then veered away and looked as if they were heading back toward the other red dot. They were very far away and appeared to flicker in the night sky. I'm not sure if they're still outside within view as I wanted to come in and report it! Cars were stopped on our street (Miramonte blvd in broomfield) watching what was a pretty eerie movement of three red lights in the sky. I first noticed this driving home from the grocery store - then called my fiance and he saw them from our house. We couldn't video it with our phones or take photos because of lighting issues. At first i thought maybe the lights were military planes in formation, but there was no noise and they were moving too slow way up in the sky to be planes."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28335.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28335.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Circle, Square, Rectagular, Star-like","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.016796","Date Submitted":"03/20/2011 10:50 UTC","Longitude":"-105.268736","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"three red dots in sky, moving in sync, first in triangle, then a line","City":"Boulder","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
