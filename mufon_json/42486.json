We lived a mile high in the mountains and the stars were always very bright. As I was faceing south, I saw what looked like a shooting star coming from the west Moving really fast as they normally do. Thats when it took my breath away as it suddenly started heading west again in just an instant. It all happenened very quickly and din't last more than about four seconds.But I have to say when it changed direction in just a mere nano second,it was gone behind our trees and I lost sight it. It really blew my mind and it was my first UFO experience. I was so excited I ran inside and told my wife about the sight I had just seen, and wished she could have seen it too."],"Date of the Event":"06/06/2006 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.210476","City":"Running Springs","Log Number":"US-09112012-0020","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42486.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42486.html"],"Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Looked like any other shooting star until it made an instant sharp turn going back the oposite direction.","Longitude":"-117.107885","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/11/2012 07:15 UTC"}
