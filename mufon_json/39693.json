{"Log Number":"US-06212012-0026","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 2:30 PM in April 1998, I was driving north on Hwy 99 in Sacramento approaching the interchange with Hwy 50. I love looking at puffy white clouds and I noticed a \"parade\" of small to medium low hanging, puffy, white clouds moving in an eastward direction, roughly along the path of eastbound Hwy 50. As I made the turn east on to Hwy 50, I noticed a small white cloud drop to the bottom of the other clouds and it started pacing my car. As I sped up to catch up with traffic, it sped up and started passing the other clouds as well as passing through them. It traveled through larger, low hanging clouds and came out the other side of those clouds in the same shape as it went in. I kept looking around wondering if anyone else noticed the cloud. As I slowed down to exist the freeway at Watt Ave, it slowed down and continued floating with the rest of the clouds down the freeway."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39693.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39693.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/06/1998 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Small cloud following a vehicle while traveling through other clouds at same rate as vehicle","Latitude":"38.590042","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Longitude":"-121.49126","Case Number":"39693","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.590042,+-121.49126(39693)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39693) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/21/2012 07:12 UTC","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around April 6th 1998"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Sacramento"}
