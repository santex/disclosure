{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy fiance and I were in the park in Ceres, near the freeway. We were stargazing, watching for the perseid meteor shower. She first saw the object fly in an upward direction, then pointed it out to me. I saw it from the point after it had changed direction, heading NNE. At first, I thought the object was a large bird, like an eagle, but soon realized that was not the case. The object in question was crescent shaped to my eye, and almost wisp-like in appearance. It had no lights, no sounds. It disappeared behind the cloud after about a minute or so, maybe less. We did not see it again, but we are at a loss to explain what it is we saw. There was no wind, and the object appeared to be moving perpendicular to the direction the clouds were headed."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"37.594321","Date of the Event":"08/12/2012 09:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41694.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41694.html"],"Case Number":"41694","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Ceres","Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 02:14 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-120.953376","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Ceres","There were no other sightings in Ceres on or around August 12th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-08132012-0002","Country":"United States","Summary":"Wisp-like crescent-shaped object appeared to go up in the air then change direction toward north east","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.594321,+-120.953376(41694)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41694) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
