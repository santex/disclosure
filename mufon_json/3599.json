To the southeast of my location (I am near Birmingham) I suddenly spotted what had to be an extremely large oval shaped red flash of light. When I say extremely large, I would relate this to the size of a city or state considering how high up in the sky this light was located. It was a plasma looking red flash of light which spread out and then disappeared."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"33.45122"}
