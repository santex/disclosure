The closer the object got to my car, I noticed a disruption in my radio station in an area with no past radio interference occurring. I pulled over to see it for as long as possible. When I exited my vehicle I noticed that the object has no sounds reverberating from it. The path of the object laid just NW of a prominent airspace traffic area of which I witnessed a commercial airliner flying in during the observation. After watching the object for several minutes, it slowly disappeared behind trees going toward (what I saw) was Beale AFB."],"Tags":"City","City":"Auburn","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.02647,+-121.055206(35378)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35378) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"01/31/2012 07:22 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02012012-0001","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.02647","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Auburn","There were no other sightings in Auburn on or around January 31st 2012"]}
