It did an abrupt turn around and at that point I took notice because I figured there was a utility problem. I got up to check out what was going on and the flashing lights were now hovering 30 plus feet off the ground about a hundred yards from me. I watched the lights and object for a couple of minutes and I figured I would either wake my wife or get a video camera. I wasn't scared but just in awe and intrigued. I ran over and shouted to my wife to wake up and it took about 45 seconds to get her back to the spot I was standing. The object had moved another one hundred yards or more across the lake to partially obscured area. My wife and I could see some of the bright orange lights thru the trees still moving about but our line of vision was obscured at that point. I walked into the bedroom to go to sleep after five minutes and noticed it was 3:30 am."],"Log Number":"US-06022009-0010","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
