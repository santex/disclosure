These were very hard to see with the naked eye. I started taking photos and saw these objects show up in better detail. My eyes could have been deceiving me. I do not know if they are lens flares or not, but I am being told by David Sereda and other optical specialists that these are not lens flares, but I am not convinced. Since MUFON is working with another agency now, it might be worth taking a look at possibly. I notice things on these photos like possible aircraft wings (?), evidence of heat being released, plasma (?) It is really hard to say. These objects were all over the place, in the eastern to southeastern sky up to five to six objects at a time. Very interesting."],"Object Features":"Wings","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Casa Grande","There were no other sightings in Casa Grande on or around January 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Cone, Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
