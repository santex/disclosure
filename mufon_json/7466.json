I am surprised I even saw the object as it was small and somewhat close to trees. The sphere had a small ring around the middle, but tilted about 45 degrees from the horizon. Only visible for about one minute as I could not slow down. Continued to observe in side and rear window. It slowly gained altitude but I lost it because of trees, a small hill and then by it's distance away. Would not have reported it except I read the recent MD report and it appears to be identical to what I saw. I am a retired Army helicopter instructor pilot with 23 years of flying experience. This object was not a balloon, or a power line obstacle marker (those are orange) and just to make sure I went back to the exact spot and there are no power lines or houses, only heavy forested area."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/07/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","City":"Fort Campbell North","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
