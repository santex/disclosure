{"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Region":"Ohio","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Toledo","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was already quite dark, about 8 pm in late September, I guess, and I was on 75S, just crossing the border between MI and OH, when I noticed two bright lights, high up in the sky, flying East. The sky was starless, the color of dark blue ink. The two lights were flying in-line, one behind the other, but not overly close. For a moment I thought that the lights came from an airliner, helicopter, though that did not make sense. They must have been very far away, that's all I could estimate. Suddenly, the front light exploded, the explosion so large that the local sky lit up. I was expecting falling debris, pieces of the structure on fire, but I saw nothing like that. The explosion lasted a second or two, and then there was only one light left in the sky, steadily following its previous path. I arrived home around midnight (4 hrs later) and tried to see if the incident was reported on the TV news. The next morning I called the local TV stations and newspapers. No one had heard of an airplane accident, airline or other."],"Log Number":"US-03012008-0006","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Toledo","There were no other sightings in Toledo on or around September 23rd 1995"],"Date Submitted":"09/23/1995 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9795.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9795.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.667868,+-83.549302(9795)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9795) map </A>","Case Number":"9795","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.549302","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"observed two lights crossing the sky W-E, one exploded, the other continued on","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.667868","Date of the Event":"09/23/1995 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
