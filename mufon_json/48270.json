It was slightly bigger than the stars. Thinking it was a plane, I glanced around and then back at the object and realized it had no blinking lights. I watched as it continued it's ascent between a couple stars and then slowly it seemed to fade and then it disappeared all together. There were quite a few airplanes flying around tonight but nothing that matches what I saw. Could have been the military fooling around but I'm not entirely sure. It looked as if something was exiting our atmosphere! Definitely not something you see every day, it has left me mystified and I only hope that someone else in my area happened to be looking up at the same time I was."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-84.074976","City":"Bethel","Region":"Ohio"}
