We where having a good time shooting off firecrackers when these lights appeared, in the sky, towards Tulsa. My younger brother thought it was nothing, but I know a ton about Astronomy. I knew it wasn't a star, because the lights where moving across the sky. Even though we have an airport and military base nearby, I knew it wasn't a plane, because there where 6 lights, in the formation or shape, of a triangle!! Also, they weren't blinking red or green. They weren't blinking at all, and there wasn't any noise. All I knew is that it wasn't a series of bright stars or planes. Then it hit me!!! They where UFOs!! This whole time my younger brother was shooting off firecrackers, but I was paying attention to the UFOs. I was trying to use my phone's camera to take a picture, but I had to clear memory space for the lights. Unfortunately, by the time I got memory space, the UFO's where gone."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40649.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40649.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Oklahoma","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Tulsa","Date Submitted":"07/10/2012 12:07 UTC"}
