{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy mother was outside taking out the garbage. She watched two objects that looked like bright stars travel at a consistent distance from each other yet in tandem with each other across the sky from south to east relatively slowly. She called for me to come outside. She pointed out the objects to me, and I watched them travel. I ran downstairs to get my sister because I have never seen anything like this before. She made it out in time to witness these objects as well. We watched and listened attentively; there were no sounds coming from these objects. We live about a half hour away from Detroit Metro Airport, so we are used to seeing and hearing planes. These were not planes. We continued to watch these objects as a plane looked like it was nearing these two objects. As the plane got closer to the objects, they disappeared! We did not see them again!"],"City":"Monroe","Log Number":"US-06202007-0012","Date Submitted":"06/19/2007 10:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7276.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7276.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.919674","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around June 19th 2007"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"7276","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.919674,+-83.38933(7276)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7276) map </A>","Summary":"2 Star-like tandem lights moving from the south to east before disappearing.","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-83.38933","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/19/2007 10:30 UTC"}
