Stopped at grocery store to pick up eggs. Turned corner from Turnpike Rd, Rte 75, Windsor Locks, onto North Street. As we approached our turn on to Acorn Drive to go home, I noticed 3 star-like entities in a grouping,each moving slightly. You could tell they were not stars or planets since they were too close to the earth and were of a different color -- a sort of dusky, dull yellowish-orange. We Pulled into North Street School parking lot to watch them instead of gong home. The show was very short-lived. I would say each \"light\" disappeared within 30-45 seconds of the others so that the whole thing lasted about a minut and a half. There were a man and a woman at the school playground that saw it, too, but they reported having seen 4 lights so we must have noticed them after one (or More) had already disappeared. My son, Nick, was witness to this also."],"Longitude":"-72.681013","Date Submitted":"08/03/2011 12:11 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"09/17/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.772751,+-72.681013(25484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25484) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"25484","Disposition":"IFO"}
