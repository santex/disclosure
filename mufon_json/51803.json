It literally appears that these leaves were baked on the limb. In addition, there is a broken branch hanging down in the middle of these dead-looking leaves. The MUFON investigator called, and was informed of this immediately after the sighting, and we were asked to take photos of the tree. Photos have been taken, but without a professional camera, it really doesn't do it justice. If anyone at MUFON is interested in investigating it further, we would still be very interested in finding out what in the world.....(or not) it was. Leaves are falling fast, however..............Not included crappy photos taken with cell phone....as it is very difficult to see. This is one of those \"you have to see it to believe it\" things.........."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"51803","Log Number":"US-10242013-0021","Longitude":"-83.887994","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.058836,+-83.887994(51803)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51803) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"ADDITIONAL INFO CASE # 48271; LOG #US-06202013-0006; submitted 6/20/2013","City":"Flushing","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","Latitude":"43.058836","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51803.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51803.html"]}
