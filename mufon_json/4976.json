{"Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.856808","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a crystal clear, very warm night. No clouds in the sky and the stars were numerious. I was outside at the edge of my driveway heading back towards the house. It was 3:46am and the distance from the street to my house is about the length of 3 mid-size cars. Anyway I was about halfway to the house when I felt compelled to look up. When I looked up, this object whatever it was, was almost right over me. It looked like a huge bright flash of light or something like a spotlight and it lasted almost as soon as I noticed it. That light then faded and I saw this faint red colored star looking thing move in a southward direction and as it moved, it kept getting fainter and fainter to see. I watched till it disappeard. The entire sighting lasted about 30 to 35 seconds. I thought this was weird, seeing this but it isn't the first time I've seen this sort of thing before. In a way I feel honored and it has me wondering."],"Longitude":"-86.564485","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4976.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4976.html"],"Case Number":"4976","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"I was outside and felt compelled to look up and in doing so saw a bright flash of light and the light turned faint red and slowly disappeared.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Alabama","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like, Other","Date Submitted":"06/23/2006 03:46 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Meridianville","There were no other sightings in Meridianville on or around June 23rd 2006"],"City":"Meridianville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.856808,+-86.564485(4976)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4976) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/23/2006 03:46 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:35","Log Number":"US-06232006-0001","Tags":"City"}
