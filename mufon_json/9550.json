(i had seen only the bottom point light previously.) both point lights were centrally placed, the space between them being about 1\\4 of the rim's width. i watched the object for another two minutes as it flew off into the far horizon and finally disappeared. the object always maintained a straight flight, its rim never tilting away from horizontal. as the object flew away i compared it with two aircraft that were visible in other areas of the sky. both appeared to be commercial airliners with familiar blinking and colored lights. while i could easily identify these airplanes, the unknown object looked like nothing i'd ever seen. however, despite its strange appearance, the object seemed rather banal and non-threatening. i had a vague feeling that it was built by humans and was being flown for mundane reasons. that was my impression of the craft at the time."],"City":"Charlotte","Latitude":"35.232077","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9550.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9550_submitter_file1__neon-rimmed_disc.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9550.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.232077,+-80.840547(9550)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9550) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/30/1977 09:00 UTC"}
