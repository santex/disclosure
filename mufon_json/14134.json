I noticed that these objects were much brighter than any other stars in the sky. I called my wife out to look at them. She mentioned that they were directly over each other and differed in size. I went in to get my video camera. I taped for about ten minutes and in that ten minutes the two objects seemed to move apart in distance. Then the top object seemed to get further and further away. At points the top object completely disappeared. When you zoomed in on the objects that looked like stars from a distance; they looked like spheres that were slowly rotating. After approximately 10 minutes I went in to grab my coat. I walked in, grabbed my coat, walked back out and they were gone. My wife and mother in law about 5 minutes later went back out and they were back but only for a few moments. I then witnessed two aircrafts flying low in the area where the objects had appeared. They were flying right on top of eachother in different directions."],"Case Number":"14134","Summary":"Two bright sphere like objects aligned over top of each other in SE sky.","Date Submitted":"11/29/2008 06:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/29/2008 06:30 UTC"}
