{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI WAS WITH MY FATHER IN OUR DRIVEWAY AND SINCE IT WAS EXTREMELY CLEAR OUT, I LOOKED UP AT THE STARS AND NOTICED THESE 9 STARS MOVING NORTH TO SOUTH, DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS, BUT I POINTED IT OUT TO MY DAD AND WE BOTH WATCHED AS THEY TRAVELED SOUTH. THE 9 STARS LOOKED LIKE THE WERE ATTACHED, AND MADE SNAKE OR WORM LIKE MOVEMENTS (AS IF SWIMMING THROUGH SPACE)CONSTANTLY CONNECTED UNTIL OUT OF VIEW. THEY ALSO MADE VERY STRANGE STRAIGHT LINE AND ODD ANGLE MOVEMENTS WHILE CONNECTED. MY REACTION AND MY FATHERS WERE OF UTTER AMAZEMENT,AND SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD ANOTHER STRANGE SIGHTING IN 2005 WHICH I WILL POST NEXT (ALONE, NOT WITH MY DAD)."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4471.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4471.html"],"Region":"New York","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around January 9th 1999"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.721203,+-74.004453(4471)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4471) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/09/1999 09:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02222006-0003","Date of the Event":"01/09/1999 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.721203","Summary":"A STRING OF 9 STARS TRAVELED NORTH TO SOUTH","City":"New York","Case Number":"4471","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-74.004453","Object Features":"Unknown"}
