(*name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms)was looking east and saw the following: at first i thought it was a star because it was stationary for about 20 seconds. then i noticed it was shimmering off the moonlight like an odd type of metallic material. while tapping my friend's arm, trying to get her attention, the disc horizontally starting moving towards the north. right about then i got my friend's attention and we both saw the same object take off as in hyperspeed to the north. we both agree the object was about 5 miles from us at an altitude of 5,000'. given this was my first ufo sighting i felt excitement and goosebumps."],"City":"Placitas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23899.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23899.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/23/2010 01:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Placitas","There were no other sightings in Placitas on or around June 22nd 2010"],"Region":"New Mexico","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
