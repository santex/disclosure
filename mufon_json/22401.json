{"Date of the Event":"03/19/2010 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-03202010-0009","divs":["Sighting DetailsI heard my dogs barking on my back pourch. Thinking it was a rat I ran outside and looked in my backyard from my pourch. I didn't see anything and glanced up and saw a white, dim object slowly moving across the sky. It was northeast from my house. First I thought it was an aircraft but did not strobe white, green, and red. It seemed very far away and thought it was a satilite but it was not clear last night and my pourch light was on. Suddenly the object seperated into two pieces. One piece going upward and one going down. I was pretty surprised so I ran inside and told my wife and my mother-in-law. They just took it lightly. Unfortunaly I don't have a great camera and I was probably the only witness. I'm posting this to see if anyone else has seen this same event."],"Date Submitted":"03/20/2010 01:30 UTC","Case Number":"22401","Summary":"Slow moving light breaks into two objects, one goes up, and one goes down.","Tags":"City","Region":"Louisiana","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Houma","There were no other sightings in Houma on or around March 19th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"29.59843","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Houma","Longitude":"-90.716575","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.59843,+-90.716575(22401)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22401) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22401.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22401.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere"}
