It was a clear evening and very warm. As a matter of coincidence i looked up, i dont know what made me look up though. I then saw a cloud, or which i thought was a cloud. It took the shape of a cloud but had black spots all over which i thought was very irregular. So as it happended i had my video camera and filmed it. I kept the video rolling until it was out of sight. During the event i was that overwhelmed by what i saw i began shivering and had sharp pains in my stomach during the event which lasted all of about 2 minutes. Another strange thing was the object just totally vanished, and this is when i headed straight back home. When i got home and i played it back through my video recorder i had a shock at what i saw. It was like a missile, it had no tail with very small wings, hardly visible at the front."],"Date of the Event":"07/10/2001 07:00 UTC","City":"Birmingham","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Wings","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.526921,+-86.7968(5493)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5493) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.7968","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Alabama","Log Number":"GB-10012006-0002"}
