(the time frame between the two images is around 10-15 seconds) the same day (the properities indicate july 8, 2004 it seems), i took a picture of grouse mountain (directly to the right of our house) showing an mysterious object that appears to be uniformly saucer-shaped... you decide. after many, many fruitless days of snapping pictures of clear skies, i took another picture [image 'abovevancouver'] showing two of the same strange objects apparently directly overhead vancouver city. what astounded me is that i did not see these objects in all four pictures. interestingly enough, the reason why i took these random pictures was because the fact that, beforehand, i read on the internet that many people who captured pictures of ufos did not see them at all, but their cameras! so outside with the digital camera on full res and a mind addled by weed... bam! i just hope these aren't snaps of bugs zipping by my camera... it couldn't be! my doubts kept me from publishing these pictures for 3-5 years (blame the wide timeframe on the pot), but... you decide, and share if you think its legit. the objects are there in the pictures. look carefully, they're either faded or tucked in the corners. i'm sending you the whole image file(s) for the truth...good luck. glen parrish"],"City":"Vancouver","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.270956,+-123.108457(6793)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6793) map </A>","Summary":"unseen cigar object captured on digital camera, unseen with unaided eye","Object Shape":"Cigar","Date Submitted":"07/08/2004 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"CA-04112007-0004","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around July 8th 2004","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-123.108457","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6793.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6793_submitter_file1__1of2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6793_submitter_file2__2of2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6793_submitter_file3__aboveVancouver.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6793.html"],"Case Number":"6793","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"49.270956"}
