It was very hard to pick them out as all have Black Objects in them. This was looking towards the northeast. These Objects must have been everywhere and who knows how many as the Camera can only see so far. You cannot view these with just the browser, you have to open them in the web browser than save the pictures to your local disk and open them in photoshop or an image program to be able to zoom in to the full size pictures. I highlighted them using a 300% zoom so I could see the distant objects otherwise they are to small to view with the web browser (IE, Netscape). I'm taking a break from this stuff for awhile. God Bless Thanks JC"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
