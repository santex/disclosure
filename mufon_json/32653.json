There is also a video on youtube of the 'North Star' growing and shape shifting at the exact time we saw it."],"Case Number":"32653","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/17/2011 09:17 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.267855","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Blimp, Disc, Flash, Sphere, Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"UFO sighted around North Star and more spotted hovering and moving over Yorkshire","Tags":"City"}
