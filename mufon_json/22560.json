At the beginning of the video, you can tell from one of the shots that the sun has set and it's almost completely dark. When the video hits the 1 minute 38 second mark, the camera suddenly pans away from the stage (did the camera man see them?) and is pointed to the horizon where there are 8 orbs hanging in the sky (too high and still to be camera flashes coming from the crowd), and if you watch closely you'll see 2 more orbs come from the middle of the screen and cross the other orbs at record speed in a right to left direction. Interestingly, a few months ago, I found a video on YouTube showing a bright orb watching a concert given in mid-day (I think it was Springsteen performing). So, Madonna 8 orbs and Springsteen 1 orb. I guess they showed up to watch the hardest working earth-woman in showbusiness."],"Longitude":"30.131003","Date of the Event":"08/02/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"8+ Orbs watching Madonna concert","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=60.084088,+30.131003(22560)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22560) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"60.084088","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in St Petersburg","There were no other sightings in St Petersburg on or around August 2nd 2009"],"Log Number":"RU-03302010-0002","City":"St Petersburg","Region":"","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22560.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22560.html"],"Case Number":"22560","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"Russian Federation"}
