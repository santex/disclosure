I pointed it out to my friends and they both saw exactly what I saw. Three green lights hovering over the mountains (My phone clock said 9:33PM) I didn't know who to contact about it but I saw this website and figured I'd give my testimony. I witnessed three bright green glowing orbs over the mountains North of the Tucson area. I've never really been one to belive in UFOs before, but I saw this thing shoot into the air after fifteen minutes... and no man-made craft does that. Whatever it was, it was pretty damn big. I don't want to sound like some insane person right now. But... I was with a group of people and they all saw it, too. They all shrugged it off but I know that stars and man made aircrafts don't look like that. Did anybody else see them?"],"Latitude":"32.390907","Case Number":"32164","Country":"United States","City":"Oro Valley","Log Number":"US-09282011-0022","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32164.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32164.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
