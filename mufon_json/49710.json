This lasted over a minute and faded. Almost immediatly a white object with a tail started in the same spot in the sky(30-40 degrees above horizon) and lasted for about 3 seconds. I was on my porch. I happened to be facing west and was trying to guess if it was an airplane or helicopter but the color was not consistant with either of these. It really seemed like it may have been a launch of some kind with a first stage seperation as I could clearly see debris trailing from the second object. It is a partly cloudy night and I thought it may have gotten lost in the clouds so I kept looking at the breaks in the clouds along the flightpath and saw nothing the first object did appear to decrease in size or be moving very quickly."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Plainfield Township","There were no other sightings in Plainfield Township on or around August 11th 2013"],"Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
