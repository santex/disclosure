It was a clear night. All of a sudden I saw a star(I thought it was a star)break formation from the others and told my co-worker that the star wasnt moving before. He said it probably was a shooting star, and we should get back to work.I told him to wait. We saw it traveling toward the river by the Statue Of Liberty,when all of a sudden it stopped above the water. We could see it shinning for about 20 seconds. Then it headed straight down the river as it looked like it would crash into the World Trade Center. It stopped on a dime and then went straight up.It looked loke a minature sun(Fireball).We heard Air Force jets, looked up and and seen five planes in V formation. We assumed it was chasing the UFO. The next day a small article in the paper read as followsTWIN TOWERS DUCK as UFO flies overhead.The paper confirmed that it was a UFO and that 56 witnesses on the New York side of the water saw it also.
