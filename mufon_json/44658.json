I noticed four lights, closely spaced to each other in the night sky. I assumed they were helicopters, a common sight in our area. I did not hear any sound, though. The first four lights dissipated once they got near the mountain range. At this point, I noticed more of these \"orbs\" coming from the ground. They came up from the ground in an arc and then stabilized on a straight path. They traveled very slow, much slower than an airplane. I did not keep count, but there were at least 20 of these lights. They appeared to be the size of a basketball or maybe a little larger. They were red and pulsating, not flashing, just a slight change in intensity. They traveled approximately a mile and before reaching the mountain range, the light slowly faded and was gone. I took video with my cell phone but I can't make out the objects on the video."],"City":"Sinking Spring","Log Number":"US-12192012-0014","Date of the Event":"12/19/2012 06:30 UTC"}
