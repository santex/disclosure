It was a triangular shaped object (I didn't see an actual triangle, but i saw three lights that made me think it must have been a triangle) the lights were blue red and green. It wasn't moving like a plane or a helicopter but sideways. I lost sight of it behind a building."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
