I looked a little closer and thought it was odd that I was not hearing anything at all. I watched the object move almost as if it were on a current of air in a northeasterly direction. One of the characteristics that seemed to set it apart from a flock of geese was that there were lights which made the outline visible. There was almost no moonlight and it was partly cloudy as well."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.875831,+-76.237342(36037)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36037) map </A>"}
