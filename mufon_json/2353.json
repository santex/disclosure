I assessed in the 7 seconds of site that its flight pattern and appearance was not humanly precedented. Second sighting was the same kind as the most recent on which was described obove. Lasting only a few seconds, but as astounding as any of them in its flight movements. My biggest concern is my discovery that I unexplainably set off metal detectors and video securitythe later not consistantly please send me anything about the metal detector anomaly. PS. I have had a couple of Xrays paid for by the state but the last one I must somehow afford which is not presently possiblebefore I can see the results considering that I had no complant of injury. I did see something on the one photo Xray but did not take it home. Belive me I was discouraged from even caring about this but you... show me if I should.6-15-03 Elliot stearns"],"Log Number":"","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-91.403483","Case Number":"2353","City":"Cuba","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.062822,+-91.403483(2353)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2353) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.062822","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cuba","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"06/24/2003 10:03 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Windy","Country":"United States"}
