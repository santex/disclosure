Once I finished I looked at the pictures on screen and I noticed a strange light that had a consistent shape throughout 6 photos i took. Didnt see anything in the sky with naked eye previously while taking the shots. I took the 6 images and digitally adjusted the values to create a bit of contrast as to see the shape and light better. Im sure this is a fullmoon + weird lens reflection thing. Probably nothing....but I'd like to see if someone could give their opinion just incase. 2 photos i managed to get clean and the other 4 are blurred ( can see by double wire, I probably moved the camera slightly during exposure) Feel free to request info or ask any questions if need. Your thoughts would be appreciated.
