Looking to were Venus was shining so brighty in the eastern sky. As I was looking suddenly a bright starlight object just popped into sight to the left and a little lower the Venus. It was just as bright and shiny as Venus and was moving in a slighly upward motion in the starfield. After moving past Venus it sudden just disappeared from view POP and it was gone. a few seconds later it reappeared much higher up above Venus where a few seconds before it was below it. It then moved off in a streak of light that was so fast my eyes could not track it . Just the trail of light it left . It was no comet because it changed direction in at least a 45* angle. I don't know what it was but it wasn't anything I know of."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
