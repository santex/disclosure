As it neared the NE it started to climb out of site. Very bright and very fast. A commercial aircraft flying in opposite direction at altitude made the object easier to document how high in the atmosphere it really was. I will give a more detailed report to MUFON Investigator as I am at work."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"13900","Log Number":"US-11222008-0015","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.918065","Summary":"Witnessed fastwalker with 2 other people.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Reading"}
