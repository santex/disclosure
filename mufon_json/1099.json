Julie and I walked outside after the news at 10 oclock. To the west, a jet was flying eastward over us. While watching thelights blinking on the aircraft, we witnessed a larger craft, flying at a higheraltitude coming from the north. As close as we could ascertain, the highercraft was triangular, much larger, faster, and completely noiseless. Thetriangle craft went out of our horizon while the jet was still in our view. Thetriangle craft had a white light on the nose as we first viewed it, but as itwent south, all three lights at the corners were orange-red. None of the lightsflashed at all. The triangle was in view for only 30 seconds to a minute. Strangeness is afoot in the skies over Arkansas."],"City":"Russellville","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/20/2001 10:26 UTC","Summary":"Triangle Craft Flying South Over Arkansas","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/20/2001 10:26 UTC","Region":"Arkansas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1099.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1099.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1099.html"]}
