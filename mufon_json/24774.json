Was looking at it through my 8\" telescope with my wife and daughter.The orb had an arm with lights. While watching \"Jupiter\" i saw it explode with a shower of sparks and smoke. I was shocked to say the least. I then dismissed the event as a satellite,comet or asteroid exploding and that it had a trajectory towards us making it appear as a disc. Tonight it happened again.This time my wife saw it in the telescope while i finished hooking it up. She said the orb grew larger and an arm extended from it right before it exploded. She had me look and i again saw the sparks as on the 21st. Both sightings were in the western sky about 9:00pm."],"Log Number":"US-07262010-0016","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Hooversville","Date Submitted":"07/26/2010 09:51 UTC"}
