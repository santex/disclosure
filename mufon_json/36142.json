I sit out in the yard. Multiples. Even with star filled sky, notice them immediately,they're easy to spot. Color is off from star color. More yellowish, glittery, white hot white & a little red. Altitudes vary, all move in amazing ways. Stop, start on a dime, up, down, diagonal, circular, backward, forward. I feel amazed, but not surprised anymore, I think, oh there they are again. I believe they've always been here, watching, observing. Probably thinking, not getting near those creatures, look what they do to each other, we wouldn't stand a chance. We'll just watch them self destruct from a safe distance. I lose sight when I go to bed for the night."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Souderton","There were no other sightings in Souderton on or around February 27th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"02/27/2012 08:59 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Object Shape":"Cigar, Circle, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Date Submitted":"02/28/2012 09:12 UTC"}
