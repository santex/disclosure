It looks to be a squirrel and appears as if something grabbed the head and pulled it hard enough to pull the entire inside of the animal out. The carcass is literally inside out. Some of the legs look long because part of the bones are still hanging from when the inside of the animal was ripped through the neck area. There was what might be the squirrel's nest laying right next to it under our tree. So this could be a matter of a hawk attacking the squirrel in it's nest, tearing the head of with such power that it pulled the entire insides of the squirrel through it's neck, and the struggle was such that it knocked the nest from the tree."],"Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-08072013-0021","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Gainesville","There were no other sightings in Gainesville on or around August 7th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"08/07/2013 07:03 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/07/2013 10:10 UTC","Longitude":"-82.466885","Summary":"Animal Mutilation","Tags":"City","City":"Gainesville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.686864,+-82.466885(49580)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49580) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
