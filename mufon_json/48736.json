But rather than \"flaming-out\" the object remained very bright, and moved slowly through the sky. I went through the house and out the front door so I could continue to watch the object move through the air. After about two minutes on a horizontal path it seem to just vanish. This was a very bright object, and seemed to slowly pulsate alternately with white light. The sky was overcast, but the object was below the cloud cover. I was also aware at the time of an unusual mechanical sound, but didn't right away connect it to the object. This was much brighter and more of an orange color than any airplane lights I have seen at night before."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"I saw a BRIGHT red-orange oval moving slowly through the sky.","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-07062013-0024","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/06/2013 05:28 UTC","Latitude":"40.272194","Longitude":"-86.126162","Date of the Event":"07/06/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:08:00","Region":"Indiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48736.html"],"City":"Undisclosed"}
