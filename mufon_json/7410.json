(i'm judging the directions based on where the sun comes up and sets here, it may not be exact.) i was freaked out and scared to death! here i was about 200ft. away from the house(the house is up a hill too) & i was all alone. my husband wouldn't be back for another 15 or 20 min. and he had no idea what was happening! i didn't turn on my flashlight because i did not want it to detect me & end up directly over top of me! as i sit on the ground, i turned to watch this thing. i watched it come closer and it kept on flying at an even speed, with no dipping or turning. it was clearly flying at an even distance from the ground, not like something falling from the sky. it continued on passing to my right. i had decided i was getting the hell outta there! the last time i laid eyes on it, it was passing behind the trees (but still clearly visible and was still heading in the nw? direction). it was still up pretty high, as high as a high flying helicopter i guess. (i'd say at arm's length, it would have taken a quarter to have covered it up.) as i started out of the fenced lot, it was still visible and i could hear the low sound of it flying through the air. i was too panicked to take the time to see if i could make out an outline of the craft. i ran as fast as i could to the house. when i made it in the door i was saying \"oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!\" (we are temporarily living with my parents) & everyone was asking what was wrong. \"ufo!!!\" i managed to spit out and i started to cry. i was so shook up. i felt stupid, but i know what i saw and the extreme fear i felt was real! my heart was racing, not just from running, but from being so scared. i managed to make a sketch of the lights i saw, although my hands were shaking like they've never shook in my life. my heart continued to race for another hour & a half. i was hot, shaking, my face and neck was splotched red, and i also felt like i needed to throw up. it took a couple of hours before i calmed down. i would like to know if anyone else witnessed this, but i'm afraid to notify local authorities about it. it would surely be in the local newspaper! and i'd rather not have that kind of attention! the time would have been approx. 1:30am on july 8, 2007."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Morehead","There were no other sightings in Morehead on or around July 8th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"07/08/2007 01:30 UTC"}
