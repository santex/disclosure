At about 5:10 pm he saw a very large very bright silver object on the top of Mt. Humphries. He called and reported it to the local authorities. At the time we were not thinking that it was anything that couldn't be explained logically. We thought it might have been a plane crash or something of that nature. The police had no other reports that day of such an object, and the object is no longer there. However, today i came across a craigslist add in the \"Rants and Raves\" section. This post was from a 63 year old man who was hiking Mt Humphries the same night that my husband saw the object. He said that he saw some 8 ft tall alien looking people walking on the Mountian. I do not know what the credibility of the craislist post is, but I thought that it was weird that the two supposedly happened on the same day and in the same place."],"Longitude":"-111.633719","Case Number":"26414","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Flagstaff","There were no other sightings in Flagstaff on or around November 3rd 2010"],"Date of the Event":"11/03/2010 05:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Flagstaff","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26414.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26414.html"],"Summary":"Very bright circular silver","Date Submitted":"11/07/2010 07:19 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
