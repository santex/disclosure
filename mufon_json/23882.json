Once we were outside by the back door , I took a camera & pointed it in the sky in the North to NE direction , at that moment he said \"there's nothing there\" , without looking at him I said \"if you look you'll see them\" , he seemed puzzled , but I took 2 photos of that area than 1 in the direction of ES. The first photo was taken at 1:11:21 PM , & although I didn't see anything , some strange 'structure' was visible , especially when brought out close & on full screen ! At first I thought it maybe shadows in the cloud creating such phenomena , but while in the full screen mode , I noticed 'ridges' on it plus above on the right side seem to be pointy triangular shapes. But the most outstanding is what looks like a 'vapor' coming-outgoing out of the middle of it ! The angle position is directed towards the lake . ( I'm aware our celestial co-brothers need of Hydrogen as one of the elements to power the ships , but this wasn't even above the water ! the lake is approx. 2 miles ? from where this thing was ). Also , the hot sun rays are consitant of illuminating this 'structure' in the sky . While I continued going through that 1st photo tiny frame by frame , there's way at the bottom of the photo & nearly directly below of this structure something else , although I cannot make out if it is an ufo ship or something entirely different . Prior to taking these photographs we both saw a sm. aircraft fly by clearly visible with motor noise a at much lower altitude . I'm attaching 3 photos . A close up of this strange shaped structure , the original photo & zoomed ufo perhaps . Couple hrs later I took additional photos of the sky in another direction with interesting domed disks shining near the sun , but unable to attach these here with the report . Needless to say I'm really puzzled & wondering in regard of this 1 st photo I took . Any ideas ?"],"Date of the Event":"06/20/2010 01:11 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23882.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23882_submitter_file1__100_0957.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23882_submitter_file2__100_0956_2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23882_submitter_file3__100_0956.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23882.html"],"Summary":"I wonder what MUFON investigators think about this \"structure\" in the cloud?!","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-79.379854","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/21/2010 11:28 UTC"}
