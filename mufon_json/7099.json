As an officer on the FDR I too witnessed a daytime event involving a cigar shaped craft that covered a span of at least 100 feet. A larger 300+ foot cigar and two 50 foot (roughly) round discs. Without stating my position, I will state that we attempted to engage the craft with weaponry and in the 10 minutes of viewing and the 4 minutes of this attempt, the weapons would not allow themselves to be prepared for engagement. We also attempted to prepare launch of aircraft at the conclusion of the event. I was informed of the object when it arrived by fellow officer who engaged me in conversation concerning the proper procedure in dealing with this type of event. At the 14 minute mark the craft rapidly travelled upward as two small round objects exited the water. At the 21 minute mark, a much larger cigar arrived from directly above the FDR and the two smaller disks enetered the cigar and then the cigar once again departed upward at 23 minutes roughly. At 26 minute mark the cigar returned and dove into the water."],"Log Number":"US-05272007-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
