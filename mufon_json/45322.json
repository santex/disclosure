We were driving on the Garden State Parkway South, when at around exit 40 a bluish-green bright object shot straight up into the air from what seemed like the trees in between the north and south lanes. It hovered for about 1 second before zooming off straight forward what seemed like 1,000mph. I know somebody else out there witnessed this, as there were many cars driving near me."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45322.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45322.html"],"Country":"United States"}
