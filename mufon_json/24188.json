{"divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting outside camping with my family at a lake 8 miles north of Appleton, MN. We had no campfire going because the wind was very strong that night so we were just talking outside. My brother and I noticed a bright glowing orange object moving from the Northwest to the southeast. Seven other family members also observed this object. It was like nothing any of us have seen before. Larger than all of the stars in the sky and a steady orange glow moving quite slow compared the speed of an airliner moving across the sky. Had a steady movement that we tracked for just a little over three minutes before it went out of our view behind the tree line. We all immediately thought and said \"its a UFO\". Overall very strange looking orange sphere. I could not estimate the height as I have no idea how big it was other than bigger than the stars in the sky that night."],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 11:16 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:03:15","City":"Appleton","Log Number":"US-07052010-0041","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24188.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24188.html"],"Latitude":"45.199167","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24188","Date of the Event":"07/02/2010 11:58 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Appleton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.199167,+-96.024444(24188)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24188) map </A>","Summary":"Glowing orange sphere","Region":"Minnesota","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-96.024444"}
