(when i first saw it, i thought: \"that looks like a ufo. what is that doing here?\" at some point in time, i remember looking out the windshield, up near the truck's top, and seeing the bottom of the ufo, very close.) then, i remember turning the curve from rfl road (cr 74e), driving fairly fast, and going north on the creedmore lakes road. i don't remember how and can't explain how i got from just west of the hilltop store on hiawatha road to the curve where rfl road turns into the creedmore lakes road. i drove up the hill on creedmore and \"sensed\" that i was going to see a ufo. i looked over the schoolhouse, and it was hovering just above the roof. the length of the schoolhouse, estimated, is 400-500 feet long. the ufo covered most of that area in length. i wasn't able to get a \"bead\" on the width, but the bottom of the ufo, (looking out of the truck's windshield prior) looked circular. the ufo appeared to be shaped like a cupcake, with a raised disc in the center, on the top. somehow, i \"received\" information (telepathically?) that the bottom of the ufo had opposing rows of magnets running simultaneously, one group going clockwise and the next group going counterclockwise. i don't know if there were just 2 circular tracks, or additional tracks, lying side-by-side. somehow, i received the impression that the \"window\" area just above the magnets was the radiant energy source (nuclear?). i noted that the light radiated out onto the trees around the school and in the immediate surroundings. i'm not sure what the rounded top of the \"cupcake's\" function was, but seemed to understand the the raised disc on the very top was the observation area. as i was driving to and away from the ufo, time seemed to stop. the ufo shot away at a sharply upward and oblique angle, going in a southwest direction. in a blink, it was gone. i saw it shrink into a dot in less than a second and disappear. i don't remember any noises. my sense of time was all shot to hell during this whole experience. at times i seemed to be in fast-forward, and at other times, i was in very slow-motion. i drove north on creedmore lakes road and found my way home. i looked at the clock at home, and noticed that it said 11:30 pm or 12:30 am. i was supposed to have been home by 10:15 pm. i'm reporting this 13 years later because i'm beginning to remember things, and back in 1995, i didn't know there was a place to report ufo sightings. currently, i'm a retired health professional; we are taught to be accurate observers. also, in my preteen-teen years, i was trained, (in the northeastern u.s.), by the air force in the ground observer's corps. a group of us kids and adults in our community volunteered to observe the sky and to report detailed information to the nearby air force base. ... currently, i am working through some of the feelings from the 1995 experience. i can remember feeling fear, looking at the bottom of the ufo over\\in front of my truck. however, i feel that, in general, the experience was a \"good one\", but very unusual. at this point, i don't remember any specific contacts with e.t.'s."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned Surface, Appendage(s)","Weather Factors":"Snow, Does Not Apply","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.802481,+-105.591663(11582)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11582) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Red Feather Lakes","Case Number":"11582","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11582.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11582.html"],"Region":"Colorado","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Red Feather Lakes","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"While driving home from work, I saw a cupcake-shaped UFO at close range.","Date Submitted":"01/31/1995 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-105.591663"}
