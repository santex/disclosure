{"Date Submitted":"06/25/2011 04:19 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"29714","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was with a friend in his garden, when I noticed a white light in the sky. At first I thought that it was a star even though it was probably about 3 times bigger than the biggest star I have ever seen. After 5 seconds of standing still it slowly started to move towards East, at the same time, losing intensity, and after 5-10 seconds it shrink into 2 bright spots, barely seen. Another 15-20 seconds it was necessary for them to fade away. It was definitely a UFO. My friend didn���t take it seriously at first, and he didn���t get a second chance to look at it and maybe think twice, since it disappeared too fast; which means I didn���t get a chance to catch it on tape because there was just not enough time. Fascinated by this, I have made an animation of the event that fairly describes what I have seen."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sarajevo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"After 5 seconds of standing still it slowly started to move towards East, at the same time, losing intensity","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"18.3564","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29714.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29714.html"],"Region":"Federacija Bosna i Hercegovina","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/16/2011 10:45 UTC","Latitude":"43.8476","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"BA-06252011-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.8476,+18.3564(29714)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29714) map </A>","City":"Sarajevo","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30"}
