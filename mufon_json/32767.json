I witnessed what initially appeared to be a large airplane flying slowly on a southwest heading. It was very oddly lit in that it had many single white lights, with the outermost lights blinking, which I why I thought airplane. It was flying very low for an airplane as well, especially as it would have been a large plane. As it got closer to me while driving I could see that it appeared to be 4 object in a tight diamond formation. I pulled over and got out and watch it continue on it slow southwest heading. It would have passed right over the Summit Crossing shopping area."],"Latitude":"38.919643","Longitude":"-94.376716","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Thought was single oddly lit large airplane, actually 4 object in tight diamond formation."}
