it was just after sunset, it was still light out, but getting harder to see. i was just under the i-435 bridge at the missouri\\kansas border on river rd. i would go to this area to play with my wolf, at the time she was a 6 month old 100% timberwolf. she began to freak out like something was there, but i could see nothing. the weird part was she wasn't looking at the woods or grass, but at the road itself, and when i looked i saw nothing there. my van was parked on the side of the road, so i began to walk her back to the van, but she wouldn't go near the road. by this time she was getting pretty big, so when she wanted to, she could pull pretty hard. she kept trying to pull me away from the road, and then she started yelping and shaking and wouldn't go any farther. i couldn't figure out what was wrong with her, so i just dragged her to the van and put her in. i then went around to get in the driver's side to go home, and that is when i saw the craft. i completely forgot about what was bothering my wolf, because this thing was huge, and really far off so i didn't feel threatened at all. it wasn't until i got home that i began to question what she might have sensed out there on that road. what i saw was flying so slow, that it didn't make any sense to me. it looked exactly like a flying monolith, that is the only way i can describe it. after about 5 minutes, i watched as a much smaller, triangle shaped craft dropped out of the bottom rear of the monolith. the monolith then sped away in an instant, while the triangle craft headed out over the highway towards kansas. the smaller craft wobbled as it flew, like a frisbee. the wobbling wasn't very dramatic, kind of like watching someone drive with an alignment problem. i've seen this triangle craft before on a discovery channel program, so i know that this was a military craft. they use some kind of centrifugal force to make tight turns and fly like a frisbee, and that is what this thing did. the one on the show i watched was the exact same type of craft, except this thing had no lights on. it's been awhile since i saw the show i'm talking about, but from what i remember, these triangle shaped craft have been verified by our military as being real. the show had actual footage, not a recreation. these things can turn on a dime, but can be explained. what freaked me out was the large monolith craft, because it didn't make any sense. i've seen a small predator stealth fighter before, here at the kc air show, and i thought that was pretty cool. this thing beat that, and the fighter was doing flips around a stealth bomber to show off. i just watched a history channel show about the stephenville tx sightings, and although they don't match what i saw, what bothered me was one of the witnesses. he said he also had a wolf, and it acted scared as well. this made me remember how my wolf acted, and got me thinking that although these craft are silent, maybe they emit high-frequency sound the wolves can hear. kind of like a dog whistle. the craft was so cool, that i just didn't connect the weird behavior of my wolf to the object until your witness said the same thing happened to his wolf. it was the old guy with the dark glasses on. i don't claim to be anything except a startled witness to something strange. what i saw appeared to be military, although strange, it didn't defy reason. what i want to know is if maybe a cloaked soldier could have been in the road, and that my wolf could smell him. this would explain why she freaked out, because she could smell but not see them. she could also have heard sounds made by the craft that i couldn't, because i never heard a sound from either craft. i have ocd, so i notice things others don't. if my wolf hadn't have been freaking out though, i wouldn't even have looked up i don't think. you guys can either believe me or not, nobody else does. i don't really care if these craft are military, just if they are alien tech. i actually support my government, so if there is any conspiracy, i'm on their side if they want to keep their secrets. i'm the kind of person that wants to know the answers to all the questions, then if the answers need to be kept secret, i wouldn't mind a bit if they shot me in the head after revealing it all to me."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/21/2002 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Date
