And disppeared behind the high building at 20.40 pm. Route and direction was from UP in the sky to DOWEN in the sky ,from south to north ,exactelly to the direction to Giza Pyramids. The second one appeared in no time ,as I was watching and covering all the sky over me ,started to be visable at 20.26 pm ,till 21.46 .I recorded both with my Panasonic video camera type ( NV-GS47 )which is very good as I recorded also the moon with very clear vision to its clear surface (I sent photo of the moon with the same camera).The route and direction of the second one from east to south west headed for the direction of Saqqara step pyramid ,but was goining from lower altetude to higher altitude.
