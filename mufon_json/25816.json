My girlfriend was on the porch when she witnessed it for the remaining 1 to 2 sec she said it look like a group of giant bird or planelike objects flying in perfect formation but they're flying too fast. The objects had no lights but appeared to be glowing real dim like it was trying to camouflage in with the sky. It also had not any sound at all and was flying as high in the sky as a bird would. It was real large bout the size of a commercial airplane flying extremely low. . This happened approximately 8:58 to 9:00pm est (10-10-10) and was only in sight about 3 or 4 secs. This was the weirdest thing I seen before."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Tarentum","Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-79.758301","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Tarentum","There were no other sightings in Tarentum on or around October 10th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.607436,+-79.758301(25816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25816) map </A>"}
