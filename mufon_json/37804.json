{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were outside at approximately 10 pm on 26 April 2012.I first noticed the light coming from the West and traveling to the East. I had my wife look at it and she immediately told me to bet my binoculars, which I did. Through the binoculars the light appeared to have an oblong or oval shape. It did not blink. I handed the binoculars to my wife and continued to observe the light. It started moving to the South and as I observed it near some stars it gradually became smaller and \"blinked out\". There was no jet engine noise associated with this object. I've seen the Space Station at night and it has always traveled to the North at a higher rate of speed. in relation to aircraft that frequent our skies here, I would say that this was about 25,000 to 30,000 feet high. I've observed satellites many times and this was not like any I've seen."],"Region":"Iowa","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37804.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37804.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-90.974754","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Mediapolis","Case Number":"37804","Date Submitted":"04/28/2012 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04282012-0009","Summary":"My wife and I observed a bright, unblinking light traveling West to east then it veered South and disappeared.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mediapolis","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.956944,+-90.974754(37804)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37804) map </A>","Latitude":"40.956944","Tags":"City"}
