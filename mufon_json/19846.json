I got up and went out on our east facing lanai. almost directly east there was a very abnormally bright light in the sky, which could have past for a very bright star or planet. every few seconds though, the light would grow brighter, or change colors, ranging from white, silver, to a more bluish color. The object never moved in any direction or differed in its actions. around 3am an airplane took off from honolulu international airport and flew eastward south of the object."],"Summary":"bright flashing stationary objest high in the sky over diamondhead","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"19.898536","City":"over diamondhead","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-10072009-0006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
