It was a clear night and I looked up and saw something moving in a straight line not making a sound. My children saw the object also. My oldest with better eyes than mine described a rounded triangle with 8 to 10 white light on the bottom. We guess it was around 5000 to 10000 feet. I was not going to report it until I saw another post from someone in Roanoke that same night stating he saw something very much the same. When we saw the object it was moving in the direction of Roanoke. I am not a believer in visitors from other planets and assume it was some type of secret military craft."],"Summary":"rounded Triangle shape with 8 to 10 lights on bottom.
