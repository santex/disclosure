My wife said it can't be the moon it's way to small. It wasn't a perfect circle, but had a slight edge missing, it was white in color almost shiny, like a bright moon. We just stared, our friend turned to swim away, my wife and I kept staring trying to figure it out, then a star like object just fell out of it straight down and stopped, by this time our friend had turned to see the large penny shaped object collapse like a balloon and also turn into a star like object, they both stood still then both at once flew west out of site. We were blow away, have no idea what it was. We live near Luke Air force base, but it's south of us, this was further north west. This was unreal to us???"],"Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-09042012-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.675396,+-112.388125(42282)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42282) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Sun City West","Summary":"Moon shaped object drops star like orb, then turns into star like orb and both fly away","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.675396","Date Submitted":"09/04/2012 12:06 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"42282","Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 06:37 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Sun City West","There were no other sightings in Sun City West on or around September 1st 2012"],"Longitude":"-112.388125"}
