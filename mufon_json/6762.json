I HAD BUILT A VERY LARGE WATERFALL IN MY BACKYARD & I WANTED TO TAKE PHOTOS OF IT, TO SEND TO FRIENDS. I WAS TRYING TO SELECT A GOOD SPOT, TO GET A GOOD SHOT OF THE WATERFALL & SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE, AS I WAS LOOKING UP AT THE WATERFALL FROM BELOW. I TOOK A QUICK PHOTO OF THE OBJECT, AS IT WAS ONLY IN MY VIEW FOR APP 30 SECS, BEFORE DISSAPEARING OVER THE SANDIA'S. IT WAS TRAVELING FROM WEST TO EAST,IN A STRAIGHT LINE, ABOUT AS FAST AS A COMMERCIAL JET. IT LOOKED AS ONE PIECE, EXCEPT IT HAD A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE MAKING IT ALMOST APPEAR AS TWO OBJECTS CONNECTED TOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW HIGH IT WAS, BUT I THINK THE SANDIA'S ARE ABOUT 10,000 FT & IT CLEARED THEM WITH ROOM TO SPARE. I ZOOMED THE PHOTO 800%, TO SHOW IT MORE CLEARLY. WAS IT A UFO? WAS IT A SECRET US AIRCRAFT? WAS IT A BALLOON? YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE!"],"Longitude":"-105.022824","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6762.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6762_submitter_file1__ScannedImage.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6762_submitter_file2__ScannedImage.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6762_submitter_file3__ScannedImage.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6762.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Hoax","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.98094,+-105.022824(6762)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6762) map </A>","trends":[""],"Region":"New Mexico","Latitude":"34.98094"}
