Called the police. Two officers arrived. The two officers, my brother, friend and myself went toward the area, crossed the bare field, then over the barbed wire fence and interred the forest. We hadn't gone but maybe I suppose a 100 feet when we all heard something coming toward us within the Forrest. The police had weapons drawn as I also did. It was a spooky feeling and the police nor us really felt safe to continue and backed out of the forest quickly. The police said they would have someone fly over the next day. That is the last we heard from them. Before that I had seen on occasion strange lights in the sky at night like moving stars but never reported anything like that until that night seeing something landing and the trees reflecting light! Then I knew for sure something had landed."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/29/2011 01:02 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33704.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33704.html"],"Latitude":"32.498634","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Landing in forest and glowed on surounding trees","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.498634,+-84.976513(33704)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33704) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Columbus","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around June 15th 1974"],"Log Number":"US-11292011-0013"}
