I turned and looked to west, nearly straight up, saw this light. Much bigger than the ISS I have seen orbit, then some sparkles appeared at its tail end, and these were yellow. I thought i may have witnessed a satellite burning up in the atmosphere, but wouldn't it have gone faster and created more of a show and burned longer. I observed this for only about 7-10 seconds, maybe a bit longer. When the sparks appeared at the tail end, the thingy just disappeared shortly after. It was a huge patch of white and no way this can be compared to a star or a shooting star. I welcome any suggestions as to what it could have been."],"Latitude":"42.702815","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"30665","Date of the Event":"07/26/2011 10:30 UTC","Summary":"Whitest light, huge compared to stars, few seconds then disappeared","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-84.599779","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Lansing Charter Township","There were no other sightings in Lansing Charter Township on or around July 26th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 12:37 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.702815,+-84.599779(30665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30665) map </A>","Object Shape":"Egg","City":"Lansing Charter Township","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
