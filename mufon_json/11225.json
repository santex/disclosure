I checked out the sky on my lunch today...June 18th at around 2:10 pm....I swear to God...I have never seen anything in my life...I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me...I saw...a boomerang....huge and low...it hovered, turned west and disappeared...Then about 15 minutes later...I saw a saucer shaped object head into a cloud formation at a high rate of speed. I will take a drug test and a polygraph....I never saw ANYTHING until I wrote a screenplay called...'Nightmare Hall'...then they started showing up....Man I wish I had a camera...out there...but they were so quick....I never would have gotten a photo...but I swear they are showing up here all the time now....and I will produce evidence and post to this site for sure...I am going to work on it....Check it out���experimental or alien���it sure is fun to wonder. Once you see it���you will believe. Just watch the skies....especially at night...I swear you will start to see something if you are in or near...Illinois....Most look like a star moving....but wait until it stops and hovers...and keep your eyes on it...and it will explode with a flash of light...and take off...It is totally amazing!! Never seen ANYTHING BEFORE....and now it is about 2 or 3 per night...every single night since June 7th....I actually lost count. Most of them are way up there...so binoculars will help if you don't have 20-10 vision like me...But today...it was lower...and each was clear as a bell. You could see it for sure....Now...most of these are a bright orbs at night...and NOT Venus...which can be clearly viewed to the east right now....I want to tell my story...but I need evidence first...and I am not kidding....I am about to call UFO Hunters or MUFON to watch with me. As they will see something for sure...It happens nightly....But today was the first time I saw one during the day...You have to keep your mind and eyes open....and you will see one for sure...No doubt about it...I want someone else to confirm it....please watch the skies...and comment if you see something...take an hour at night....when you see the orb start to move...you will believe me. I guess it took a UFO conspiracy screenplay...for them to finally show up in my life. Today I jumped up out of my lawnchair when I saw the boomerang...it was huge...and black...fifteen minutes later was my first flying saucer too...what the hell is going on? No way anyone would believe me...until you see it for yourself....I swear I saw what I saw...& I cannot change that. No one believes me yet...but they will when they see one. I have waited my entire life to see one...and they are here for sure."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/18/2008 02:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Chicago","Latitude":"41.887324","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Disc","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There was one other sighting in Chicago on or around June 18th 2008"],"Case Number":"11225","Date Submitted":"06/18/2008 02:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11225.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11225.html"],"Region":"Illinois"}
