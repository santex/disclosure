{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was home waiting for my hubby to call on break @ 20:30 on Sunday March 20, 2011. When he did call, he told me to go out and look at the sky to the west of my location. When I did, I didn't see anything at first. I went in te house and grabbed the night vision device that we have. (couldn't find the camera) and went back out to the west side of the house. With eye view seen the 3 pulsating lights in the sky about 30 degrees off the horizon to the west. I watched it for 2 Min's to see if they were moving, which they were not. I putt the night scope to the lights and seen 3 pulsates before they disappeared. At which point I pulled night scope down and confirmed they were no longer there... later at around 21:45 me and my mom seen the pulsating light in the sky just to the west again. they were not moving and disappeared at 21:52. Sadly no film caught."],"Date of the Event":"03/20/2011 08:33 UTC","Latitude":"39.989052","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03212011-0004","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Brighton","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/21/2011 02:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28341.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28341.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.989052,+-104.816848(28341)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28341) map </A>","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Brighton","There were no other sightings in Brighton on or around March 20th 2011"],"Summary":"3 pulsating lights in a circler shape","Region":"Colorado","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"28341","Longitude":"-104.816848"}
