{"divs":["sighting detailsi would like to report a ufo sighting that my wife and i both had on the nightof 04\\23\\02.at about 00:30 i took the dogs out for their midnight run. i do this everynight. we live on thirty five wooded acres in st.charles mi, exactly one milewest of ____ on _______ rd. it was a clear night for looking at stars etc. wheni looked to the north west i saw a very bright star-like object moving wildly;but staying in the same general area. i watched this cylinder shaped objectmoving for at least five minutes. i then ran into the house to get my wife tomake sure i was seeing what i thought i was seeing. i was, she saw it too! shewatched it for a few moments and then retired to the house. she isnt veryinterested in ufos. after watching this object together she went in and icontinued scanning the skys for anything elce. at this point i saw two moreobjects moving, but several miles to the north and south of the one we were bothwatching. i stayed outside with the dogs moving to several different areas onthe property to see if i could get a better look at the objects to the north andsouth of the main object. i usually carry a large flashlight with me when i walkthe dogs, and i had one that night. i was 100 yards away from the house when ilet go with a burst of three flashes toward the object in front of me. i didthis several times in the hope that they would perhaps flash back. this went onfor about ten minutes without any responce from the object in front of me. iwould guess this thing to be maybe 1-2 miles up in front of me, but there was noway to tell as i had no idea of what its size was supposed to be. out of nowhere a huge brilliant, shimmering circluar object came in at me from the southof this object. it came in at tree top level, and it was huge! it had to be thesize of a two story house. it was dead quiet, it didnt make a sound! it didlight up the surounding area however. before i even flashed the light i had madup my mind that if things went bad, i would run as fast as i could to try andreach the house. this is exactly what i did! it scared me so bad that to thisday whenever i take the dogs out at night, i dont stray too far from the door. iam always scanning the sky to make sure i know what is around before i even moveaway from the house. there was no doubt in my mind that this \"craft\" was aboutto abduct me from the property. if i haddent been ready before hand i belive itwould have nailed me for dead sure! i ran so fast that i beat both dogs to thehouse who were also running when i screamed run!!! if i had owned a video camerai would have the best ufo footage, i have ever seen to be sure; and perhaps thebest footage ever. the craft that came in at me in my direction first apeared to me to have been nofuther than 1000 feet due south and about 1500 to 2000 feet due west, no futherthan 100 feet up. later checking the distance in the day light i found thisestimate to be very close. how i was luckey enough to have had a split second toescape from this thing i will never know. it must of misjudged my where-aboutsas it wasnt the craft i was watching overhead. in concluding this sighting iremember that the main object seemed to change shapes at times. if it wasntchanging shapes then it must have been doing something in its manuvers to appearto do so. at times it looked like two cylinderical shaped objects side by side,and then at other times it looked as if it were three cylinderical shapedobjects in the shape of a triangle. very strange. i tried to call the st.charlespolice dept. to get someone out here to see it when it was happening but i gotno answer after several calls. i called my dad and told him what happened. mydad then called the sherrifs dept. and reported to them what i had seen, theirresponce to him was that they have had several reports of ufos out here. hetold me they totally believed him; which makes me feel good. in closing i willstate that i have seen very many ufos out here since my wife and myself movedout here in 1987. this however was one of the best sightings i have ever had.two years ago my next door negihbor and i had a day time sighting of a verylarge classic silver disc moving totally without any sound . the duration ofthis sighting was perhaps 30 seconds. after i had the 04\\23\\02 sighting i wasunable to sleep the whole night, since that night i have watched from three tofive ufos every night; up to and including last night when i saw five craftmoving in the north west sky. these things always seem to be around. i believethis area out here would be a very good area to have someone from yourorganization come out and investigate. if you guys are interested please let meknow, i am retired and stay up most of the night anyway. maybe we could get somereal good documentation of what i believe is a real ufo hotspot in michigan. ifiled one report with www.ufocenter.com , other than that i have never filed areport or called anyone to make a report on a ufo. other than the fact that youcan usually see ufos on a regular basis out here , when you do see craft; thesightings are of usually very long duration. many times you can watch ufos outhere from dusk until dawn. i wish i had the money to purchase a video camera, iwill now for sure get one asap!"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Michigan","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"1832","Longitude":"-84.140535","Date of the Event":"04/23/2002 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1832.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1832.html"],"Latitude":"43.29697","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.29697,+-84.140535(1832)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1832) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St Charles","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Date Submitted":"04/23/2002 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"St Charles","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"","Tags":"City","Summary":"I was watching a large star like object in St.Char","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
