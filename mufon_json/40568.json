I looked at the conor of the room by the bedroom window and saw a solid thing that was sicking out of the wall. At the moment i thought it was a decoration that was put up and i didn't see it before. But just before my eyes the object looked like it was disappearing away into the wall. I prayed to God since i was so scared but my cousins were still asleep. There was light coming form the bathroom next door so i knew what i saw was clear since the room wasn't compleatly dark. Trying go back to sleep i felt an uneasy feeling and i started to see lights out side of the window bhinde the blinds. So i got up and called my Mother to explain what was happening. But that feeling just got stronger and i was begeging to feel like i was being controled so i ran out of the room."]}
