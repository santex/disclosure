On May 30th, I took a picture of the statue of Andrew Jackson. On June 26th, 2009, I was showing the picture to a friend of mine (Scott Huff), and we noticed an odd object above the statue. When we zoomed in, we were unable to identify what the object actually is. It resembles a classic UFO shape and Scott suggested I send the picture to you for closer observation. I don't know what it is and I don't remember it when I took the picture, so I would appreciate any feedback you can give me as to what this might be. Thank you."],"Log Number":"US-06262009-0012","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-77.030796","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17678.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17678_submitter_file1__IMG_5716.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17678.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"38.896472","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/30/2009 12:24 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Looking at vacation pictures and noticed an odd object.","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"17678","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.896472,+-77.030796(17678)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17678) map </A>","Region":"District of Columbia","City":"Washington"}
