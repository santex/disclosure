At one point the white light (the whole thing was white) would just go out like a lite switch and than come back on. I called my friend to see it and we both watched it untill it was to far to see. I went to Aviation High School and I know how an airplane can move in flight and how it \"CAN NOT\" move in flight. It was very large, much bigger than any plane. Again, It made absoloutly no sound at all. We live in a very quite place and there was no other noise."],"City":"Bradenton","Date of the Event":"05/15/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"07:25:00","Longitude":"-82.566389","Latitude":"27.507878","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
