I was on the way home after taking my grandmother to the hospital. I was coming down off the exit ramp and noticed an orange sphere in the sky. I stopped right there, on the exit ramp, in the middle of the road staring at the object. My aunt was also with us. I know that both she and I saw it. I'm not sure if my grandma would remember as she has early onset of dementia. I pulled off to a lot right beside the ramp and got out of the car. I stood there for 10 minutes as I watched the fireball move up and down. It would disappear and reappear. Upon the 2nd reappearance a 2nd fireball came down, also moving up and down. One went up and disappeared for good, while the other changed shape into a barely visible triangular object with rounded edges. It spun around like a boomerang and then disappeared. At some point during this experience I called my friend who lived nearby. He and his mother, and his brothers' friend saw it. I thought it was over so I got back into the car and started driving home. I saw it once more in my rear view mirror, so I pulled over and watched it for five more minutes before my grandma started complaining and wanted to go home."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"45966","City":"Chapmanville","Latitude":"37.982591","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-82.01245"}
