AFter looking at photos (the ones I reduced) I sent to your site, they looked horrible! I didn't realize when I resized them (to transfer them quicker) they would reduce the quality so much. So, here is photo 98, which is the one where the object appears in its full size 2274 X 1074 approx. Please advise if you wish to have the other ones (right before and after) full size as well.
