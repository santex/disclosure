There were no city lights and had already turned dark. We were standing outside of the house which was a second floor balcony of a two story house.It was my mom, my dad, my brother, my husband at that time and myself. we saw lights coming from a corner in front of us, at first we thought it might be a helicopter, or a small plane,because it was in the air,but as it got closer it started to look like a train,big!But it was silent, it got closer, very close. We all saw it, it was amazing it was like a train full of coloroful lights suspended in mid air. its colors were red, blue and yellow,or green. Some of the lights flashed,some where just moving. It was so close, there was no mistaking what we all saw. Unfortonately we didnt see any articles in the papers about this apparence.We looked and searched but never found anything.I hope with your investigation you can give us some answers"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.72426,+-80.264314(26504)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26504) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
