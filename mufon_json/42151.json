I believed her as we talk about this often, and I thought I had seen one from my deck. My home is 2 miles due north of her location at our local beach and we tried to spot the same things but not able to. I drove down to the beach. It took a few minutes for them to reappear after I arrived, but sure enough, there were these beautiful lights that changed colors -- when I first looked through my binoculars it looked as though it was a translucent rainbow sphere, changing colors from red, white, blues greens. It was really beautiful. We watched for about 30 more minutes while several more came into view all over the sky. Two of them hovered parallel to each other, and the others seems to be close to the horizon. There is a lot of rock cliffs and wild area where they might have been (I have no idea spatially how to determine how far they were). They would mostly stay in view, but once in a while drift out of sight, then reappear. We had a full moon, clear sky, but once in a while we wondered if some mist had blown in, but it hadn't. So, maybe cloaking or something? I have no idea. This was a first for me."],"Log Number":"US-08302012-0013","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Flash, Sphere","Case Number":"42151","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Rhode Island","Country":"United States","Summary":"I joined a friend at the beach who was watching 3 or 4 light entities come in to the sky, colors changing, hovering, slowly moving up, down and across the sky.","City":"Middletown","Date Submitted":"08/30/2012 10:24 UTC"}
