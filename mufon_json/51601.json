{"Case Number":"51601","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailstriangle light formation seen moving from south to north over avondale \\ goodyear. light got my attention, it was dimmed low intensity orange light, which appears to glow, the closer the object got, the more it was looking like the light spots were arranged in rings. the arrangement of those single light spots were in a triangular manner, 5 lights. the closer the object came, the more i saw of the shape of the object. it was looking like a boomerang, but with sharp edges. a bit like the b2 bomber, but without the thick \"middle section or fuselage\" it was slim and there was no noise. i guess i was about 2 miles away from it, and if this would have been a b2 i would have heard anything. but there was nothing. no noise!!! and it was moving very fast. my job has to do with aviation, and as far from my knowledge about aerodynamics, turbines, and military aircraft i can definately say that, this ufo was supersonic, and way too low for being without any noise! even after passage! it disappeared over phoenix after about 10 seconds"],"Date of the Event":"10/16/2013 09:14 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Fast Moving Silent Triangle /Boomerang","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-112.347302","City":"Avondale","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"10/17/2013 02:47 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"33.442988","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51601.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51601.html"],"Log Number":"US-10172013-0005","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.442988,+-112.347302(51601)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51601) map </A>","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Avondale","There were no other sightings in Avondale on or around October 16th 2013"]}
