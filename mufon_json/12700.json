I slowed my car down so we could watch. While it was moving it would change colors from white,yellow, purple, red, and green. There is nothing that I know of that can move as fast as this light did across the sky. It came to a sudden stop and got smaller and smaller turned blue and disapeared quickly it took about 5 seconds to vanish. My daughter and I looked at each other with our mouths open and said what did we just see."],"Date of the Event":"10/14/2007 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-94.769119","Summary":"a light flashing and moving in a zig-zag across the top of the trees then stoped and got smaller then disappeared."}
