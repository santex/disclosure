Nobody was around and nobody was awake. I looked over at the trees and there was a red light. I thought it was a plane until it emerged. It floated straight upwards and all of a sudden I couldn't move. I got really shakey and i just stared at it in awe. It moved really weird. Really fast left to right and up and down. And it was rotating at the same time. I watched it as it passed and then it just disapeared, maybe it just started going really really fast so I couldn't see. But I know it was NOT a plane. I felt like i was going to throw up after it happened for a long time. It was very close to my house so now i am worried. But I hope to see it again."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Baldwinsville","There were no other sightings in Baldwinsville on or around January 18th 2008"],"Case Number":"9009","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-76.33271","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Baldwinsville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.158679,+-76.33271(9009)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9009) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/18/2008 07:00 UTC","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Region":"New York","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Scary, Fast, shocking","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/18/2008 07:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Other","Source":"MUFON"}
