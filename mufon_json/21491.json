(as it appeared). as i observed the object, it did not appear to be travelling away from or deviate from it's hovering position..it hovered for less than 2-3 minutes before it slowly ascended and travelled in a ne arc, which ended in a se flight path. we reentered the car and continued to drive se, when at the object reappeared briefly over the ridgeline several miles se of it's original position. my son thought that the object instantly vanished, but i could not verify the observation as i was driving. we lost visual contact with the object when it disappeared over a ridgeline. a few minutes later we met a friend and explained what we observed. she stated that one of her family friends claims to have witnessed a similar sighting 5-10 years ago in the approximate same location. our friend agreed to have him contact me to discuss the incident and have a laugh... i did not take any cell phone photos or videos, as it was too cold and my cell camera produces very low quality photos. i considered contacting the local law enforcement agencies, but considering i am an attorney and have political\\judicial aspirations, i did not think it wise. as an aside, my son and i maintain an interest in ufo's, watch all ufo programs and documentaries, which may predjudice the value of this observation. however, my son and i observed something odd, that did not appear to be an aircraft, did not emit sound and was not shaped like any aerodynamic aircraft we are familiar with. interesting, exciting and disturbing. i would like to learn whether any of the other witnesses travelling northbound on kilby rd. reported similar sightings? i know that several cars slowed to observe the craft."],"Summary":"shimmering gold white & red lights, appeared square with height almost a pyramid","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
