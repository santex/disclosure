i don���t know. its a mystery! the triped may have been back the next night too, but i didn���t see it! it had moved stuff around like a toddler would have. it was into everything exploring i guess. on 8-18-09 at around 3:00am i was witness to a giant bird above eakins oval with a 40 foot wing span or better, it had rectangle shaped wings and no tail feathers, i didn't see any feet or head either. all i could make out was the huge wings with all of the feathers moving in the breeze and there were hundreds of them, there were no primary feathers that i could see. it looked like a enormous kite. i'm a bird watcher and never seen a bird like this before. i was really quite fed up with all the paranormal stuff happening to me at this time so i watched it for about 4 minuets and decided to just ignored it and go on about my business before it did something really weird and unexplainable. \"wow \" a sumerian god come to earth! an angle maybe? i can take see an alien off my bucket list! nothing else has happened since."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.209742,+-77.190645(19742)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19742) map </A>","Case Number":"19742","Log Number":"US-09302009-0004","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-77.190645","Date of the Event":"08/15/2009 02:45 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/30/2009 08:57 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","trends":[""]}
