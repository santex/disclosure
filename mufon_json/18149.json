I thought it was a jet at first, based upon how fast it was going, but I realized there were no wings and no sound associated with a normal aircraft. I went outside to take a better look at it, but as far as I could tell this was not a conventional aircraft. It had a cigar shape to it and had a wierd \"back end\", similar to a submarine with a propeller. It was traveling in a relatively straight line, no variations to speed or direction. I watched it until it disappeared from my view over the roof of the house next door. It was a very strange experience. I didn't feel scared, just puzzled. I'd like to know if others saw this and what they thought."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Elk Grove","There were no other sightings in Elk Grove on or around July 18th 2009"],"Region":"California","Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-121.363668","City":"Elk Grove","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18149.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18149.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/18/2009 06:45 UTC","Latitude":"38.412149","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/18/2009 06:45 UTC","Summary":"shiny cigar shaped ufo","Log Number":"US-07182009-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
