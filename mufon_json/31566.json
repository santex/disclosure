First sighting ever......2 orange, glowing orbs, raced around in and out of the clouds at about 1500ft. They moved as fast as a passenger jet but changed direction very quickly. They disappeared for about 30 seconds and then reappeared for less than 1 minute and repeated the same behavior. I felt I was witnessing intelligent live as these orbs seemed to \"play' with each other as they darted in and out of the clouds."],"City":"Ottawa","Latitude":"45.344786","Date Submitted":"09/05/2011 09:05 UTC","Longitude":"-75.933062","Region":"Ontario","Date of the Event":"08/26/2011 08:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
