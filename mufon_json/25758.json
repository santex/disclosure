i have my sights on one already! green and blue pulsating spiked thing. looks like a tiny star in the sky but it''s pulsating green and blue! it's really really high up. even with the telescope, it's tiny 12 hours ago ��� i got my neighbour guy to come over and look through my telescope and tell me if what i am seeing is correct and he saw the same thingand said he's never seen anything like it. it is like a white circle in the middle with a black circle around that. and then emanating from that, radiating, is laserlike bright green and red spokes. but they are not in a straight line. it's almost like one of tesla's electricity orbs. and they alternate red and green and they pulsate randomly. 11 hours ago ��� ok, i sat out with the telescope and looked at other stars to compare. 1st of all i can say that as a telescope for nighttime astronomy watching, it sucks. it would be better suited to see a bird in a far off tree, for example. when i look ...at other stars through it, it has a tendency to want to stick a red and green halo around things and it's REALLY difficult to focus, or know what the right focus is for a star. so i think this telescope enhanced the red and green that was already there in the object i watched. but with my naked eyes and with my binoculars it also looks pulsating red and green, and the neighbour guy said he thought so, too. i'm not sure now if i had the telescope focused correctly on the object. i may have had it out of focus a little so it seemed like the spokes radiated more than they did, but i'm not sure. what i can tell you for sure is it does pulsate weirdly with the naked eye. it moves weirdly, very faintly again tonight. more of a very small up and down back and forth movements that were hardly detectable. it starts out in the sky really high. it is super high up there. it is super far away. like when an airplane is a dot kind of far away. it looks different from different angles. but basically if i had to descibe it it is white in the center, then green, and red on the outer rim. but my telescope is probably distorting that. there is definitely something pulsating and spiky about it. it looked like a firework or the top of an umbrella opening and closing, if the top of the umbrella had a laser light show going on it. at one point it looked like a spinning top. if it was spinning, it was seeming to move clockwise. i'm not convinced that i had the focus right to see it correctly. i can say it doesn't seem \"normal\". i don't know what kind of thing would behave in this way. starting out each night at the same time in the same place and basically going the same route, while not remaining in a complete staright line like a star or satellite. and having irregular pulsing, not blinking. tomorrow, if it shows up again, M will be home with me finally to see it and i can get his opinion on it. it sucks to not have any other witnesses to this thing (except my enighbour), so i can't be completely sure if i am seeing things correcly or using the telescope correctly. 9 hours ago ��� i can't imagine that someone has been launching the same led light kite or balloon each night and managing to get it that high and managing to make it go exactly in the same pattern and behind the same tree each night to the point where it ...goes behind the same spot of the tree. that would have to be some pretty exact flying. but i don't fly balloons or kites so i don't know. there also hasn't been any wind these past few nights. for the record, the deer and the dogs were not jumping and barking tonight. things were calmer. oh, and the sky has been perfectly clear all 3 nights 9 hours ago"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO"}
