After seeing several cigar shaped UFOs reported with a black black dot on the middle, I think they are talking about this kind of airplane, which someone told me was a DC9. I was on the freeway when this one passed across and above,. I did not hear a sound but I could see that the wings were very short and at first site it seemed like i did not have them. This does not mean that there may be real UFOs with this shape, but really, I doubt that they could be exacty like this airplane, as described several times in the last few months."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","trends":[""],"Longitude":"-81.511664","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32523.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32523_submitter_file1__cigarplane.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32523.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/11/2011 12:52 UTC","Summary":"It's what coudl e construed as a cigar shaped UFO","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"27.670447","Case Number":"32523","Object Shape":"Cigar","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/01/2011 01:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida"}
