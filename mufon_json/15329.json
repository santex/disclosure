This object did not appear to be any aircraft, living near an airport most of my life, knowing what maneuvers an aircraft at night would make. This object make a straight line in the directions mentioned above, and would make stops and hold for a few seconds. To determine the movements weren't due to my car, I stopped for a couple minutes and observed. The object was still moving in the mentioned movements. I eventually lost sight of the object as I made it into the Scottsbluff city limits. When I travel home from work after midnight, I have seen similar lights like this in last several weeks, in different directions relative to the city of Scottsbluff."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.814094,+-103.636272(15329)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15329) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.814094","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Scotts Bluff","There were no other sightings in Scotts Bluff on or around February 4th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-103.636272","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Nebraska","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-02052009-0012","City":"Scotts Bluff","Date of the Event":"02/04/2009 08:45 UTC"}
