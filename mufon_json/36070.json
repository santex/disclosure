About 3 miles from my home just before we had to make a right turn to the restaurant I saw in front of us a luminous light that was slowly moving to our left at about 2 mph, and about 120 feet away. It would flash at times seemingly from the sun. It had a moon shaped object about 3 feet from it that was also white, and half the size as the main part, and it did not flash. The main part that flashed had no particular shape, as it looked roundish on some corners, and kind of squarish. When my mother made a right turn as soon as we saw it for about a minute we realized it was gone. No conventional aircraft could have vanished that fast. Thank you."],"Case Number":"36070","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
