The object reminded me of an animal cell. Not perfectly round, but a bright white light inside of a red orange outter orb, somewhat like the nucleus of an animal cell. The object started high but raised even higher to a point that was invisible to the naked eye. The object was lost from sight when it finally ascended too high to be seen."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Moline","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.51136","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48590.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48590.html"],"Longitude":"-90.511334"}
