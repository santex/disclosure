{"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhere: I was at hillside cemetery. Who: with my friend. There were also a few other people there at the cemetery as well approximately 4 others. What: I saw a ball of light that traveled slowly over my head and behind me. It was high in the sky. Miles above me. It kept traveling at a bit of an arc, but not straight. It dimmed for a second and then another ball of light appeared near that was a bit more red than the first ball of light that I saw. The reddish ball of light faded out and the first ball of light that i saw kept going in the direction that it was in and then it disappeared. Neither of the lights made any noise. They were about the size of a penny if you held it at arms length away from you. When: It was at 11:30 Weather: partially cloudy, but you could see the object when it went behind the clouds. Feelings: I felt warm and happy when they went by. I was happy when I saw the objects in the sky. I saw something similar to what I saw tonight almost a year ago on June 20th 2010 (it's the 14th today)."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.024703,+-93.220967(29543)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29543) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/14/2011 03:02 UTC","Case Number":"29543","Longitude":"-93.220967","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St Anthony","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06142011-0003","Date of the Event":"06/14/2011 11:30 UTC","City":"St Anthony","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"A ball of light that travelled slowly and made no noise.","Region":"Minnesota","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"45.024703","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29543.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29543.html"],"Tags":"City"}
