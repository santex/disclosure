(He had recent eye surgery and was worried about \"black dots in his vision)I could also see it. We thought it was a small plane.It was quickly approaching us above the trees and as it got closer, it got bigger and bigger. It was pure black. It had no lights. It didn't make any sound.It looked - as it got closer, as if it were standing on edge, straight up and down and shaped like a diamond with small projections ( like points but not sharp) coming out from it - like a shield with points? It was huge, like a floating garage, as it passed over us. We stopped the car to watch it - but in that instant, it was gone. It has always bothered us. What in hell did we see that morning?
