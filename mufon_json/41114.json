I immediately noticed it was a bit weird so I immediately pulled into a small street and began to take video of it with my cell phone. Unfortunately since the sun was almost set the video looks dark but the light is visible and floating around. So as I was recording I was watching this blue light and trying to make sense of it. I even called on a kid that was crossing the street at the time and asked him if he was seeing the same thing I was seeing. He then said that he had already seen the light a couple of days ago."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Source":"MUFON"}
