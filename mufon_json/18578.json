Finally, she called my attention to it, I opened multiple windows, looking out and up. I could not discern a source but observed a moderately loud rythmic sound of rushing air, cycling about every 30 seconds. This lasted for at least eight minutes and ceased about two minutues prior to the arrival of the Erie County Sheriff's Department and Grand Island fire Department. We had been experiencing off and on severe thunderstorms, but during the time of oberservation no storms were in progress in the immediate area and the air was nearly still, with a very high humidity. Conditions were overcast. Since we had just experienced severe storms I was concerned about possible utility line damage. None has been discovered in the immediate area. Of note the sound was readily detectable inside the house with the windows closed and the central airconditioning running."]}
