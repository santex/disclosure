I noticed strings of webbing float in the wind. Then I noticed that trees and streetlights were covered in them. I got in my car to drive home. I then noticed 7- 10 objects that were emitting white light behind cloud cover. These lights in the clouds were moving very quickly in back and forth sweeping motions over long distances. I pulled over to observe them more. I do not think they were spotlights because the amount of light emitted from these objects were dimmed as it moved through thicker cloud coverage. I got in my car and returned home."],"Date of the Event":"11/13/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26560.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26560.html"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/14/2010 02:52 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were no other sightings in Austin on or around November 13th 2010"],"Latitude":"30.269583","Case Number":"26560","Summary":"7- 10 objects that were emitting white light behind cloud cover.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-97.738831","Tags":"City","City":"Austin","Log Number":"US-11142010-0002"}
