Suddenly it took a straight 90 degree turn to the south at double the speed it was initially traveling and shot out of sight. I have seen lots of satellites, but how this thing turned on a dime, and increased speed tells me it was no satellite and impossible for anything man made to pull this maneuver. It gave me chills."],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-09232009-0007","Summary":"Satellites don't move like that","Date of the Event":"09/23/2009 06:08 UTC","Region":"Kansas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19598.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19598.html"],"Case Number":"19598","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.885876,+-94.812508(19598)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19598) map </A>","Longitude":"-94.812508","Latitude":"38.885876","Date Submitted":"09/23/2009 08:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
