I'm in view on the vancouver international airport - i see planes come and go. This stayed stationary. Yet hovered to the west slowly. Grabbed binoculars, others came out, watched in amazement as it seemed that there were military planes that were flying by in what usually is not a typical pattern for landing in Vancouver. Low flying planes....perhaps Military deployed to watch this sphere! UFO had blue red and white lights....for over an hour - we all watched, also on the phone, other witness' were watching this too! The fog clouds started to come from the west, and the ORB started to disappear. This was 100% not a plane nor a helicopter."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Burnaby","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
