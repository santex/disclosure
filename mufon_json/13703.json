It was flying in a West-NorthWest direction and passed over the road directly in front of me. The craft appeared to be a jet engine design though it produced no visible exhaust or flame. It was also completely silent, and I was close enough that I should have heard an idleing engine or something. it was moving very slow, maybe 15 MPH. It appeared to be maintaining a steady altitude. It was larger than a standard American fighter jet. the front end was long and round. the wings appeared to be set back towards the back of the fuselage. The Color appeared to be a black or dark green. The overall styling looked Vietnam era or older. This is a rural area and the only low flying aircraft are usually crop dusters. The weather was cool and very windy, but sunny."],"Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Object Features":"Wings","Latitude":"39.309958","Log Number":"US-11142008-0001","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-102.262026","Date of the Event":"11/14/2008 01:01 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy, Heavy","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Burlington","There were no other sightings in Burlington on or around November 14th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13703.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13703.html"],"Summary":"Bizzar aircraft","City":"Burlington","Case Number":"13703","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
