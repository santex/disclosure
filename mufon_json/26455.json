{"Latitude":"42.334357","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailsnot sure of exact year, not ever able to connect with anyone to discuss the event. It had to be late spring or early summer of 1962-64. I was quite young at the time. My parents home backed up to a heavily wooded area. At dawn I was awakened, and looked out of my rear window. At that moment I saw a disc shaped object hovering in our back yard. I noticed that it was directly over mom's laundry pole. This was about 35' from the back of the house. The object was about 40' in width, and about 15' high. It made no sound.Half of the object hovered over our back yard, the other in the woods. After I sighted the object, (lasting only a matter seconds), I have no memory of any event. Only that very brief encounter. Please, anyone who may have a connection, contact me. Its like close encounters where no one believes you."],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.334357,+-83.040484(26455)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26455) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"dark gray round silent object 30-40' wide hovered within 35' of my location","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Circle","Date Submitted":"11/09/2010 03:09 UTC","City":"Detroit","Case Number":"26455","Date of the Event":"06/30/1963 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26455.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26455.html"],"Longitude":"-83.040484","Log Number":"US-11092010-0004","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Detroit","There were no other sightings in Detroit on or around June 30th 1963"],"Country":"United States"}
