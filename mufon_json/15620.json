It did.I stared at it as it sort of slowly drifted about.It seemed to be west of me above Mt.Madonna.I could not judge the distance. I decided to get in my car to get a closer look.Half way up the mountain I could still see it through the trees.When I got there it was gone."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"02/19/2009 08:40 UTC","City":"Gilroy","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Gilroy","There were no other sightings in Gilroy on or around February 19th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
