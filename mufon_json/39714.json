They were outdoors when they both noticed a very bright light hovering in the sky over Sonora TX, It was stationary for a short while then took off with a very high rate of speed. They said they were amazed at how bright it was and how it made no sound whatsoever. They both noted that nothing they knew of could travel that fast.
