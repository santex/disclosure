When I first spotted it, I thought it could've been the planet mars - due to its bright red color. That's when I noticed it was moving very slow from left to right across the sky. And this is over the brightly lit city of New Castle. It was a starlike orb that twinkled and pulsed. It was the slowest thing I've ever seen, and I've seen many possible ufos. I lost sight of it after leaving to do something. When I'd returned the orb was nowhere to be seen. I had only left for no less than 5-10 minutes. Perhaps, it was the planet Mars, but I'm sure Mars doesn't move like this orb did."],"Date Submitted":"03/30/2012 06:16 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
