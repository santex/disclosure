{"Region":"Missouri","Longitude":"-93.287029","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy mom and I were staring up at the sky in our backyard watching planes and I saw a bright circular light that looked like a shooting star, but it was moving slower than a shooting star, but faster than an airplane. The light was constant, it was not blinking, and there were no other lights around it. It was moving in an Easterly direction and appeared to be rising up since the light was getting smaller and smaller. When the light was above the moon, I could not find it at all. About 30 seconds later I saw it moving in a Westerly direction, it was still small and not pulsating, eventually I lost sight of it since it flew too far away for me to see. I checked the satellite trackers and there's nothing I could find going over the area and the light was nothing like the other airplanes in the sky. I'm pretty darn excited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25165.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Springfield","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Latitude":"37.218607","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around August 23rd 2010"],"Log Number":"US-08232010-0004","Case Number":"25165","Summary":"Bright circular light that got smaller and then made 120 degree turn","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/23/2010 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/23/2010 09:17 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.218607,+-93.287029(25165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25165) map </A>"}
