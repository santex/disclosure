We both observed an object that was shaped like a cigar & was a very shiny silver color. It reflected the sun. It almost looked like it was mirrored. It hovered there for about 30 seconds then as we were proceeding onto the on ramp we lost it. It just disappeared & was no where in sight. This is now my 3rd ufo sighting in less than a month! (3rd sighting ever!)
