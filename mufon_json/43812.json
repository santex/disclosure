I greeted her at the back door of my home. Upon opening up the door, she said \"Hey look at this up in the sky\". So I stepped out and looked up, and very high in the sky was a white object. Nothing particular stood out to me, it was just there. We looked at it for a few minutes, it was stationary. I went back into the house to get my Polaroid i532 digital camera. That took a few minutes, because I wanted to make sure the batteries were in the camera. I then came back outside; my friend was still looking at it. I then pointed my camera up at the object and snapped four pictures of the object. After I took the pictures, my friend and I went into the house. The day was crystal clear not a cloud in the sky. I've live 5 minutes��� drive from LAX; I'm right in the pathway of air traffic landings 24 hours a days. I've lived near the Los Angeles airport since 1971, and have seen all types of air craft. This object stayed stationary for at least 15 minutes once I was aware of it. After I took the pictures, I looked at them and dismissed it as nothing special. Here it is 3 ��� years later. In the last two days I have analyzed these pictures. When I enlarge them, the object becomes luminous, and looks round. In one of the pictures, there is a power line in the foreground. That gives you depth of field, you get a since of how high the object is. In another photo the moon is in the background and the object is in the foreground, now this in the daytime. One photo in particular, when enlarged. Looks luminous, tilted to the side, saucer shaped. So I decided to contact mufon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.944755,+-118.335728(43812)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43812) map </A>","Longitude":"-118.335728","Summary":"My friend stopped by to see me.
