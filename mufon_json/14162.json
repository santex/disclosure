I observed a bright object in the southern sky - unable to tell the distance. I watched it for a good 30-40 minutes. There were two red lights on its perimeter that appeared to be part of it. These were at the 9:00 - 3:00 positions, and would move to the 12:00 - 6:00 positions. They would stop and then go back the other way. I observed the object as it appeared to drop down in an extremely rapid southern movement then return to the original position. This happened only once during the period of observation. I returned to my residence, got a pair of 8-power binoculars, and observed the object through them. I could not make out any more details. I went back out at about 8:30 p.m. and the object was gone."],"Sighting Duration":"00:40:00","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There was one other sighting in Fort Worth on or around November 29th 2008"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.733049","Longitude":"-97.31493","Date of the Event":"11/29/2008 05:30 UTC","City":"Fort Worth","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.733049,+-97.31493(14162)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14162) map </A>"}
