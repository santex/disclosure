The brightness of a starlike object caught my attention about 45��� up in the western sky, which was free of clouds. I observed the object the whole time through the windshield of my car, which happened to be clean for a change. At the time the object was bright and starlike and then would disappear for a brief time, only to reappear. The effect would be the same as if one looked at a aluminum pie plate that was tumbling in the wind. The traffic light turned green and and I had to proceed through traffic and attempted to find another viewing spot, but was unable to do so. I felt no physiologic or psychological effects at the time of the viewing incident. The object did not appear to be moving, but only hovering. There were no other observers in the area that I could tell."],"Log Number":"US-01272008-0013","City":"Denver","Longitude":"-104.979703","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9296.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/25/2008 03:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Summary":"Star like UFO in western day time sky.","Latitude":"39.747524","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"01/25/2008 03:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were 2 other sightings in Denver on or around January 25th 2008"],"Case Number":"9296","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States"}
