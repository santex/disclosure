I lived in Ypsilanti. At 10:30 pm, I went out to my back porch. The sky was clear and cold. I was waiting to see the space shuttle. After 1 min, a rectangular shaped object appeared from behind my tree in the back yard and moved over the tree top in a northerly direction and passed directly above me (10 ft). It was approx 10feet long and 3 feet wide. It was grey and sounded like an \"electrical\" hum as it passed over. I looked up and saw port holes on the underside. Obviously, this was not the space shuttle. I thought this was the shuttle, but learned recently that the shuttle was traveling thousands of miles above the earth. For a year, I thought I saw the space shuttle. It was a shuttle, I'm sure, but not from here. I remember it so vividly. I was thrilled when I saw it and didn't give it another thought. I went back into the house thinking I saw the NASA shuttle, up close."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Ypsilanti","Date Submitted":"09/30/2007 10:30 UTC"}
