She's like my world, until my world was invaded by ALIENS! we left Austin heading towards Waco down I-35 at about 11. we were about half way there when all of a sudden my girlfriend in the passenger seat and me in the drivers seat saw a bright green flash that almost looked like a shooting star, but it seemed way to big and close to be one, and it was GREEN! like it was just like a shooting star but bigger, which makes me think it must have been closer, and it was shining a tealish green. and then we continued on are way."]}
