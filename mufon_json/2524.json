Siezing the momentof clear skys, I laid out in an open field on my back and was gazing at thebeautiful stars. After just a few moments maybe 10 minutes, an orangered Vappeared in the sky with stars above and below it. It was traveling rapidly in aSE direction, the legs of the V facing forward. It traveled almost out of mysight, then came back in the opposite direction. I did not stay to watch it anylonger as an intense fear overcame me. I ran inside and collapsed, curled up ina ball, not able to speak and had hyper-ventilated breathing. I have never beenso frightened in my life, and Ive seen UFOs several times throughout my lfe. Dont know what was so different about this one - why it frightened me sohorrifically."],"Log Number":"","City":"Redwood Valley","Date of the Event":"08/29/2003 10:00 UTC","Case Number":"2524","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.265445,+-123.20445(2524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2524) map </A>","Longitude":"-123.20445","Summary":"V shape above stars","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Redwood Valley","There were no other sightings in Redwood Valley on or around August 29th 2003"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
