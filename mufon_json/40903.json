I could not identify the hovering object as a model aircraft and its movements did not dictate that it was a model airplane. The object will move very rapidly in an indiscernible pattern within the night sky and is engulfed within a light that obscures the actual vessel from ground based observation but this particular probe produces a field that can generate images of objects, people, and entities. The images can be viewed when the video is paused. Below are some examples of the images the craft can generate when the video is paused. After recording the object, for the length of the video I panned down and panned the area to show the viewer(s) that I was at the local park then departed the location.
