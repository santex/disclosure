{"City":"Blaine","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09202013-0021","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my back porch, it faces west without obstruction to low level sight. I was watching the approaching sunset that was about 45 min. away. I always notice the flight traffic in my area as BHam Intl. airport is south of me. I noticed what I at first thought was a jetliner, but once I tuned in on it I saw it was not a jet. It seemed to be more like a arrowhead that was gold in color perhaps because of the sunset. It had what appeared to be exhaust of perhaps a flame, it wasnt the normal trails you would see from a jetliner of any kind. My interest was on high and I went into my kitchen that is right with my porch to get my binoculars, I was only gone seconds but the object was gone. I searched the sky for several minutes but never saw it again. The exhaust seemed solid and close to the rear of the UFO, this is what really caught my interest."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50935.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50935.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"48.922789","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Blaine","There were no other sightings in Blaine on or around August 5th 2013"],"Case Number":"50935","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.922789,+-122.746586(50935)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50935) map </A>","Region":"Washington","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"{kt}saw UFO as bright outlined object with a short brighter exhaust.
