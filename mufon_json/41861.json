{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my deck watching the skies. It was a clear and sunny evening. There were plenty of birds flying around at this time. All of a sudden I noticed this fast object glide a straight across the sky directly above me in a unwavering fashion. I took a closer look, thinking it was a fast flying bird. It was a round, basketball size type sphere! At that point I freaked. I immediately got out of my chair and stood up for a closer look. It continued to fly pass me and over my house. I then ran around my house to see the object. As I got around my house, it was standing still above the tree line. It did not move and I watched it for about 1 minute. I then ran back into my house to get my camcorder. When I got outside with the video camera, it was gone."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Kirkville","There were no other sightings in Kirkville on or around August 18th 2012"],"Case Number":"41861","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"bright white sphere basketball size","Longitude":"-75.938706","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08192012-0009","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"08/19/2012 10:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41861.html"],"City":"Kirkville","Latitude":"43.097418","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.097418,+-75.938706(41861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41861) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/18/2012 05:00 UTC","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
