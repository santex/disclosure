We are located at the intersection of 183 and Mopac in a 4 story building on the 2nd floor facing East, it was SE of the intersection. It appeared to be fairly large although it was hard to guage, but it definately wasn't small, it hovered, it almost seemed to be floating and wobbling as it moved up into the clouds over about a 5 or 10 minute period. The hole was easily seen, it looked like a big dark doughnut. It didn't seem to be powered or travel with any visible intention or direction, it was moving slowly. I've never seen anything like it before, I don't know what it was."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03102008-0008"}
