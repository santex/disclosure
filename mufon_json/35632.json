I selected these from some 200+ I have acquired whlie taking hundreds of pictures of chemtrails. Mufons new site layout is real nice. I can show you three sequential pictures with a chemtrai to give you bearings. . All three pictures, and I have more from this shoot. Were shot in the same minute, timed by j-peg # and date. The one white orb up high, is crystal clear, appears to look like a moon! The others decend or are moving. In an arc path. Of many similar groups shots I have. I thouht these would look nice and clear. Thanks, Guy from Whiitier....keep looking at the sky!
