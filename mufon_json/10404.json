{"Date of the Event":"04/18/2008 09:10 UTC","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is becoming a daily event. I was outside having a smoke break and as usual I was scanning the skies to see if I could find any of the star-like UFO's that I have been seeing on a daily basis here in Phoenix, but I didn't see anything like that at all. As I turned to go back in the building I looked up one last time and this time I saw two very distinct round or possibly disc shaped UFO's flying side-by-side, heading from West to East at a fast rate of speed. They never wavered in the distance between the two of them as they were flying along either - just rock steady. If anyone else in Phoenix is seeing these things - PLEASE email me and let me know what you are seeing too. I just can't believe that I am seeing UFO's every single day now...what is going on ?
