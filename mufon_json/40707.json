When we both noticed a metal craft in the sky, that was just hovering. It had no wings, no propellers, and had no motion. I first noticed it because the sun reflected brightly off of it. I thought it was a plane at first but then I noticed it wasn't moving. Once I noticed it wasn't moving, I kept watching it as we drove down the highway. I figured that it would come more in focus and I would realize it was just a helicopter. The longer I watched the more I realized this was not normal. I lost sight of the object in an instant. It was as if the craft was hovering and then immediately accerlated to an incredible speed. It was in the west. It must have taken a western flightpath. For how fast it apparently moved though, it could have moved in any direction."],"Latitude":"33.00958","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07112012-0018","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/11/2012 01:35 UTC","City":"Gray","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.00958,+-83.533782(40707)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40707) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"40707","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Gray","There were no other sightings in Gray on or around May 15th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc"}
