It flew over us and kept going.","divs":["sighting detailsit was a long time ago, but i have never forgotten it. about the only date i'm sure of, is the year. it was 1961, or 62, summer time. there may have been even a closer town other than san antonio. the place was called timber lake....i remember that much. it used to cost us five dollars for entrance, and we could keep all the fish we caught. i remember it being a pretty run down place.....trash everywhere, etc. we used to roll out our bedrolls up from the shore line, under the mesquite trees, to stay away from waters edge at night because of the water moccassons. (snakes). on this particular night, i remember we were all happy because dad had bought 3 old army cots from the army\\navy store, that my brothers and i got to use. we were excited that we didnt have to sleep on the ground, in our \"bed rolls\". (we were poor, and couldn't afford expensive sleeping bags.)mom and dad and the youngest brother slept on the ground, on a matteress. but i remember laying there this night, doing what preteen kids do, when my brother and i noticed a light through the trees that just kept getting brighter and brighter, like lights on a car would as it got closer. it didnt seem to be coming from any one direction, but rather just kind of all around us. and all of a sudden, at the tree top level, there was this huge object that went racing by and over us, like a jet or something. the only noise we heard wa a \"whoosh\" type sound as it passed, but then all of a sudden again, a gust of really hot, hot wind rustled the trees like a hurricane would, and over tipped our cots. all 3 of them over turned, and we wound up on the ground. mom and dad were sitting up with dad saying what the hell was that....or something to that effect, i remember. they told us to go back to bed, and we'd go look for it in the morning.....so, we did. well.....we kind of laid there all night waiting for it to happen again. it didn't of course, but when day light arrived, we took off in the direction it was traveling to see if we could find out where it had crashed. we didnt find anything, nothing at all. but it was so low when it passed overhead, we were certain it was going to crash somewhere. but, where the only noise we heard was that soft whoosh, and no explosions or anything, we thought too, that maybe it had just landed someplace. i know, my brothers and i didn't fish that next day, as we were out hiking around trying to find this thing. it was huge, and it was fast. once it'd past us, the light we'd seen at first just kind of followed it off behind it. i've been going to tell some one about this for years....i just didnt know who to tell, nor where to tell it. i guess mufon is the answer to both questions. my brother and i talk about this every now and then......usually when some one says some thing about ufo's. it happened....i'll swear on the holy grail, on the bible, to god himself....it happened. some of the details are kind of sketchy now, but for the most part, thats how it happened. it was 61 or 62, in the summer time i'm pretty sure.....whereas texas doesnt really have a winter, it very well could have been springtime, or even fall. i'm just not sure of the time of year.....like thats going to make a big difference? honest to god fellas, this happened. i was 10 or 11, and i remember it well. like i said.....i cant tell you what we had for dinner that night, or what color my pants were, but it did happen [cms\\pid\\tg] - name removed by cms admin"],"trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around April 30th 1962"],"Latitude":"29.425532","Date Submitted":"04/30/1962 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01202009-0013","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15018.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","City":"San Antonio","Case Number":"15018","Date of the Event":"04/30/1962 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
