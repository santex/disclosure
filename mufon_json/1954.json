I stepped out into myback yard and was doing such, which I am embarassed to say, when I noticed awhining sound. I looked over and saw this sphere hanging there in the air, notreally bobbing or anything, just like it was mounted in place. The sound pickedup, and suddenly shot forward at high speed 30 feet infront of me or so. Itblurred with speed, then struck my fence and rattled the wood before goingthrough it and curving upward into the sky, disappearing at at LEAST 1 mile asecond. It left a 23.5 cm hole in the fence, which I repaired before my fathergot home, as I knew hed be mad at me and blame me for it. I have the woodstill. The wood itself was bored through smoothly."]}
