Looking toward front of my house, I saw a bright orangish light, moving at a fairly fast clip in a northwesterly direction. Thinking the object seemed strange I went to the front of my house to get a better view. There I saw another orangish light moving in line with the first. At this point I called to my partner in the house and she came out and saw the lights, as well. Another 2 lights followed behind these lights. The lights seemed to be evenly spaced. I watched as the lights quickly went from being very bright to being tiny and then disappearing completely. This all happened within perhaps 3-4 minutes, perhaps less."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Apalachicola","There were no other sightings in Apalachicola on or around February 9th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.979744","Date of the Event":"02/09/2013 09:20 UTC","Object Features":"None","City":"Apalachicola","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"45639","Latitude":"29.731278","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45639.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45639.html"],"Summary":"saw 4-5 orangish-red glow lights moving in a line, in unison, across sky in Northwesterly direction"}
