What makes it unique is that it was very bright and considerably large. It was the color of a street light and I saw it through my window curtains that are almost opaque. I live close to the Polk Parkway in Auburndale and at the time I was facing North so if it was something like a meteorite it would be in the vicinity of Polk City."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"15173","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Auburndale","There were no other sightings in Auburndale on or around January 16th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.065298,+-81.788691(15173)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15173) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.788691","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/16/2009 10:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
