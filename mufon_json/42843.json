{"divs":["Sighting DetailsArrived at work about 6:25 a.m. and after parking my car, I noticed how beautiful the sunrise was. The sky was basically filled with red clouds. I decided to take a picture of the sky with my phone camera, so I snapped the first picture, then walked a few paces so that I could get a clear photo without any light poles or obstructions. I snapped a few more pictures and then proceeded into work. When I looked at the photos that I had taken,I noticed what seemed to be two lights to the right of a cloud formation that I had photographed. I work for a helicopter manufacturer in the area, but we had no aircraft in the area at that time of the morning and commercial aircraft do not enter this airspace. I am not sure of what it is. Just thought you might be interested."],"Region":"Connecticut","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09262012-0021","Longitude":"-73.119535","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Stratford","There were no other sightings in Stratford on or around September 24th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42843.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42843_submitter_file1__039.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42843_submitter_file2__040.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42843_submitter_file3__041.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42843_submitter_file4__038.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42843.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.232754,+-73.119535(42843)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42843) map </A>","Case Number":"42843","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/24/2012 06:30 UTC","City":"Stratford","Summary":"Snapped picture of cloud formation/viewed photo later and noticed lights in picture","Latitude":"41.232754","Date Submitted":"09/26/2012 06:56 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
