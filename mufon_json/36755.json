(we tried to use our cell phones to record what we were seeing before we ran)... my friend, inital reaction seemed to be a fight or flight response, i kept looking at the objects as they approached. he said to me, \"run, run!\" as we ran through the soccer field we kept looking at the lights as they appeared over us (possibly 100-300 ft. in the sky). as we ran, we noticed a car pulling up to the parking lot; as they seen us running toward their direction... they immediately left right as we made it towards a street lamp. as we stood there we watched the triangle shape objects head south bound for about a good 5 mins. then discussed what we had seen, my friend no longer wanting to stay we parted ways and headed home."],"Date Submitted":"03/26/2012 04:29 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"03/23/2012 09:45 UTC","Latitude":"33.408544","Log Number":"US-03262012-0011","Tags":"City","Case Number":"36755","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36755.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36755.html"],"Longitude":"-104.549629","Summary":"triangular lights.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.408544,+-104.549629(36755)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36755) map </A>","Region":"New Mexico","City":"Roswell"}
