I saw an extremely large light brown oval object (not shiny) with no wings and with at least 20 small darker circles on top of the object like windows. It was flying at a slower rate of speed than the airliner I was on. I tracked the object for a minute before I lost sight of it. There were no lights on the object and it was clear daylight. It was so unusual I was reluctant to report. What struck me the most was it had no wings, the large size, the steady slower speed, the color and the details seen on the top of the object. I could barely believe what I was seeing. I thought the pilots could not have missed it and was their responsiblity to report it. I only say something now because of the extremely large object reported in Stephensville."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.275406,+-122.818092(9136)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9136) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-01212008-0034","City":"Phoenix"}
