I thought it was much to small to be a plane. I have seen so many strange things in the sky over my house and surrounding area I am rarely without my camera anymore so I took some photos and video of the object. I wasnt able to get much before my view was totally obscured as it moved further away. attached are 3 short videos. I'm not sure what this was but I have had Many sightings of unexplainable objects in the last three years. I really believe I might live in some sort of \"hotspot\"."],"Longitude":"-119.411632","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11126.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/10/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":[""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","Log Number":"US-06112008-0002"}
