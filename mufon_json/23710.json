It was fast, passing by us in about a minute. Coming from the west and heading east. It was also pretty low to the ground, approximately 500-1000 ft. high. It was completely silent, both my girlfriend and I could not make out a sound. I couldn't make the shape of the object out because it was extremely bright. It seemed to be a white light without any flashing. That's what I orginally thought was odd, but the lack of any sound is far stranger. Since most of the planes and helicopters I do see pass by are very loud. It moved in a straight line and I lost sight of it once it passed behind some trees. At first I thought it was a helicopter because a medical helicopter passed going in the same direction an hour earlier. Though I recall how loud the helicopter was. Then I thought maybe it was a blimp because its race weekend. But it was moving much too fast for any blimp I've ever seen."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.157318,+-84.036523(23710)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23710) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/11/2010 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23710.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23710.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/12/2010 01:38 UTC","Object Shape":"Chevron, Other","Tags":"City","Case Number":"23710","Log Number":"US-06122010-0008","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Manchester","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Latitude":"42.157318","Region":"Michigan"}
