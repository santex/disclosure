The event lasted approximately two seconds. I can't say how long the trail was but it dissipated quickly. I didn't hear any unusual sounds during the event. My vehicle windows were closed. I was driving at an approximate speed of fifty mph. I witnessed this event through the windshield. I can't remember if it was cloudy or not but it was clear with no rain or snow. I saw no other anomalous in the sky that night. I first took the falling green light to be a meteorite, thus the reason in the delayed reporting of it."],"Case Number":"28277","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28277.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28277.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"37.743974","trends":["There have been no other sightings in rogers","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"03/18/2011 09:57 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"witnessed possible meteorite in northeast sky between 10:30 and 11:00 pm event lasted approximately two seconds","Region":"Kentucky","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.635467","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03182011-0010","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02"}
