At first I thought they were planets then realised that planets are not seen by the naked eye just one foot apart that close together, my husband was quite taken back in seeing them ,as I was driving I had to turn a bend they went out of view but it did worry me as I said to my husband I have to come back on my own which I felt quite uneasy about what we had seen, it was just daylight and that part of the sky was clear at the time from clouds, when I got back home about 20 minutes later I went outside to have a look at the sky,at the back and front of our house and saw nothing, I have never ever seen anything like that before,I go out the same time every morning weekdays and again at night at 7pm the same route, I still feel uneasy about this, any explanation would be welcomed."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Blundeston","There were no other sightings in Blundeston on or around February 2nd 2013"],"City":"Blundeston","Case Number":"45695","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.520382,+1.697163(45695)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45695) map </A>","Longitude":"1.697163","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/13/2013 01:04 UTC","Region":""}
