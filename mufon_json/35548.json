At first thought it to be an airplane but then realized it was not moving like an airplane but hovering. Had jerky movements from side to side which I thought could be a helicopter. had constant red light but flashed intermittent White, Blue, Green lights. No sound. Many airplanes passed by while watching this. At first the object was much lower in the horizon then the airplanes and could notice the flashing more. But eventually the object got higher and was about the height of the airplanes flying by. Finally, the object must have been moving away from us as I could no longer see the lights flashing and it got so small it just looked like the other stars in the sky. Tried to take video footage of the event but would not capture what we were seeing. We looked at it through binoculars. Saw a video on youtube that was a similar experience and looked just like what we saw. Took place in Texas at the end of 2011."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
