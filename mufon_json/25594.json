I was waiting to see if anyone else reported something like this first because I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. But I see someone in Austin made a report. Im about 4 hours away from Austin but I too saw a pulsating orb going from NE to SW. It just went slowly across the sky till out of view, wasn't a plane or helicopter. Just a fairly large pulsating orb, was white in color, wasn't a satellite. I have no clue what it was."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-99.729034","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"25594","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.450296,+-99.729034(25594)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25594) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25594.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25594.html"],"Latitude":"32.450296","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date of the Event":"09/27/2010 11:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Abilene","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/28/2010 01:36 UTC","Summary":"Pulsating Orb","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were no other sightings in Abilene on or around September 27th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None"}
