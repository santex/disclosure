I believe it was late fall 1985 when I noticed a deltoid shape of 7 white lights high in the sky moving east to west dead over head. It was approximately 2000 feet high and made absolutely no sound but blocked out the stars so it was very large like an airliner. I saw this with about 4-5 other people in the parking lot and there was a story in the Torrington Register the next day. Watched it for about 10 minutes until it slowly flew out of sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
