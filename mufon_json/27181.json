{"divs":["sighting detailsi was traveling east on western row road approaching the intersection of western row road and snider road. my wife and i both seen the objects ahead of us in the sky. i guessed the objects were no farther away than a mile and no higher up than maybe 700 to 800 feet. we were able to guess the height by using the wlw radio tower across town as a reference. the objects appeared to be 3 dark objects roughly round in shape with a pulsing flickering orange\\amber light at the top. the objects were moving in a triangular formation in a northerly direction with 2 objects in the lead and one trailing. the 2 lead objects were moving erratically forward and back in a horizontal manner while still maintaining a northward direction. at first we thought the objects were helicopters but realized they didn't have the telltale shape of an aircraft. i turned left\\north onto snider road to try to keep the objects in sight but they gained elevation and were obscured by the clouds before they reached the wlw radio tower."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/31/2010 06:25 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27181.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27181.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Mason","There were no other sightings in Mason on or around December 31st 2010"],"Longitude":"-84.303849","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.368089,+-84.303849(27181)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27181) map </A>","Case Number":"27181","Date of the Event":"12/31/2010 05:41 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Mason","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.368089","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"3 objects flying in triangular formation","Log Number":"US-12312010-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
