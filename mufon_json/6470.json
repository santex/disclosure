{"Weather Factors":"Snow, Light","divs":["sighting detailshere in northwest bend, oregon, my husband, neighbor, and i walked next door, to another neighbor's house tonight, right around 6:05pm pst (civilian time). i know because a tv show that we tivo'ed began just as we were walking out the front door. we were in the next door neighbor's house for probably about ten minutes. when the three of us left the next door neighbor's house, we walked outside, and around to the west side of the nextdoor neighbor's house. as we did, i looked into the night sky because it was a pretty night. it was mostly clear (i could see one or two early stars (i.e. bright ones - perhaps venus or saturn?)), there were one or two light clouds (it was snowing very sparsely), and it was not a dark or darkening sky, yet. the sun was just starting to set. in other words, the sky was still 80%, or so, day lit. immediately i noticed a very bright gold consitent light (it didn't blink or alternate with another color). it appeared to be very high in the sky. it moved in a straight line, towards the southeast from the west (past the moon), quickly. i describe \"quickly\", here as moving faster than i've ever seen a jet fly (including the high altitude flights one can see sometimes by the jet fuel trail); but the speed was not a streak or comet-like. the speed was speedy and consistent. there was no sound whatsoever. there was no blinking tail or wing lights. there was no blinking, there was no other light, the light shone at the same hue and brilliance the entire time i saw the object. when i realized that i heard nothing and that it was one singular continuous light i thought 'what is that? it can't be an airplane as there are not safety lights and it's silent'. it was an extremely bright light for the altitude that it must have been at. in other words, this was not a satellite - it was too early to be able to see one, this light was much brighter and larger than satilites, and it moved quicker than satellites (which do move quickly when seen in the dark night sky, and they're smaller lights than this one was). in about 30 or 40 seconds, or so, it had crossed most of the entire sky (the whole expanse of the sky that we could see). there was nothing else moving\\flying in the sky. i watched it cross the sky. by the time that we were walking into our front door (just next door, mind you) it was out of the field of vision of our view, of the whole sky. in other words, it was gone. i asked my husband to look at it a few seconds after i noticed it. he saw it. later, when he and i were alone back in our house, i asked him what he thought. he agrees with me that it was not a satelite as it was too bright a light to be a satellite and it was too early in the evening (given the daylight) to be able to see satellites. he said that he didn't know what it was. he thinks it could've been a high altitude flight. when i remind him that there wasn't any noise he admits he can't explain why a high altitude flight would not be heard (even they have a very audible bass sound). i reminded him that \"ufo\" is \"unidentified flying object\". he admitted he doesn't know what it was, but he has a difficult time saying it was definitely a ufo. sadly, i did not get a a photo or recording (there was no sound to record) of it. if i were to sketch what i saw, it would appear to be a larger star moving silently and quickly in a straight line across an 80% still daylit sky."],"Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-02282007-0002","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-121.31393","Case Number":"6470","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"02/27/2007 06:15 UTC","Summary":"Silent bright solid light crosses sky in straight trajectory eastward quickly.","Date of the Event":"02/27/2007 06:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Bend","There were no other sightings in Bend on or around February 27th 2007"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.062763,+-121.31393(6470)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6470) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"44.062763","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6470.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6470.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Bend","Region":"Oregon"}
