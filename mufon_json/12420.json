I woke my husband who was able to see this for about 15 seconds until we could not see it through our window anymore. At that point we both got out of bed and looked out the window to see where it went, we did not see that rapidly blinking start light again but saw approximately 6-8 white blinking lights that formed a circle (looked as if it was the size of our development or bigger, HUGE craft). We considered the option of it being planes but there was no red light on another wing, they were all moving in formation, and it wouldn���t explain the blinking light. It did sound like 5 planes were going over our house (subtle but noticeable) but it made more of a hovering sound rather than plans and continued until we saw it slowly move to the east. That was the last we saw of it until we couldn���t see anymore because of the slight precipitation in the air. I can���t think of anything else that would explain this encounter and have never seen a UFO in my life. I have seen plenty of planes and it was not that, my husband works at an airport so he knows it wasn���t as well."],"Tags":"City"}
