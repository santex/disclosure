The sky was clear and the weather was fine at about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning I decided to go outside my workshop to have a break, while I was outside I happened to look up into the sky, as I looked up I could see an airliner which was flying fairly low, the plane was silver with no visable markings. While I watched it flyover I happened to notice comming from the north west to south east a red oxide coloured disced shaped object which did a complete circled around the fusilege of the aircraft and then moved off at high speed to the south east. Approximately 5 seconds after this the same craft came back this time from the south west to the north east circling the aircraft again and heading off towards the north east. On that particular day because of the amount of air traffic passing over that morning there must have been something onboard that particular aircraft that it was interested in."],"Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"02/16/1997 11:20 UTC","Case Number":"6783","Summary":"UFO circling aircraft"}
