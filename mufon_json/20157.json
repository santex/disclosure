Glancing upwards to get a closer look and maybe see another shooting star, to my surprise instead I saw a black triangle gliding southbound about 50 to 75 ft in the sky. There were 3 circular lights on the bottom of the triangle which was equilateral in shape. The 3 circles were glowing very dimly and were not radiating much light. The Triangle was very dark in color and I would have totally missed it if it wasn���t for the shooting star. I believe that the shooting star may have actually come out of the triangle shaped object, but I can���t be sure since it happened so fast. A few other strange facts about what I witnessed: The shooting star appeared to shoot sideways and even a little upward which I have never seen before with a shooting star. Also the same night about 15-20 minutes later I saw two bright \"stars\" to the bottom left of the constellation Orion. These stars seemed out of place and were pretty close to one another. I tried keeping my eyes on the two stars but trees blocked my view since I was driving through a forested area. Once I broke past the forested area the two stars were gone. This all happened within a 30 second period from first noticing the stars and to them disappearing. I have to think that someone else must have seen this too since I was not the only vehicle on the highway at the time."],"Log Number":"US-10272009-0007","Summary":"Black flying triangle, weird stars"}
