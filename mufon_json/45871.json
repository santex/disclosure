Broadway, N.J., Hunting in treestand 2. Decended over tree line at approximately half mile 3. What the hell is it? intelligent control, coming this way, heading directly at my brother some 600 yards away 4. White, yellow ,glowing orb. Moved without sound very slowly. It illuminated the corn as it moved under what can only be described as intelligent control. We observed the object for 35 minutes. It floated over the tree line and out of sight 5. At first curious... What is it... not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a plane, not a flare or natural event.... What is it?! Confused, disbelief, frightened, spooked I left my bow hanging on the hook in the tree, climbed down and ran 500 yards back to my car. I will go out for breakfast and come back later to get my brother, I thought. As I got to the paved road, I noticed my brother speedily walking toward me. \"Why'd ya' come down early bro.?\"...\", I asked.... \"Did you see that f...in' light?!\", He responded We don't talk about it and I will never hunt that property again. This completely freaked us out. We are not the type of people that are freaked out by anything. I am convinced it was extratestrial. 6.Maneuvered over tree line and out of sight"],"Summary":"35 minute multipule sighting round glowing orb","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
