{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi had just gotten off work in springboro and was walking out to my car and just happened to look at the sky and seen what looked like 4 falling orang\\gold meteors in a cluster with a little tail behind them falling toward the horizon. i looked at them for a few seconds and they dissapeared and then 4 pretty bright white star looking things appeared in the same spot. they didn't move much at first but then started moving randomly around for about 15 seconds then went back to looking like they did before when they were falling and then again back to the star like things. they went into the tree line and i couldn't see them anymore. the same thing happened to me about a month earlier but i didn't think much of it until i seen the exact same thing in the same area which is what i described above. i looked it up to try to find out what it was and i found a similar thing happened to someone in lebanon and springboro the day after i seen it myself."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/28/2013 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.559362","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Longitude":"-84.231142","Date Submitted":"10/03/2013 11:45 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Springboro","There were no other sightings in Springboro on or around July 28th 2013"],"City":"Springboro","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.559362,+-84.231142(51296)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51296) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51296.html"],"Case Number":"51296","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-10032013-0016","Summary":"Failing and moving lights"}
