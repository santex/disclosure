I thought to grab my camera to take a picture of the foggy mountains. I took one picture which is just thick fog, then I took this photo as the fog started to thin a bit. It was only later that I recognized there were objects in my photo, which look unlike any unknown object I've ever seen in photos. There are clearly two objects hovering over the town of Sedona, AZ, and a third more distant one up in the top left of the photo."],"City":"Sedona","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Fog, Heavy","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.87271,+-111.75888(8260)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8260) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.87271","Date Submitted":"10/02/2007 06:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05"}
