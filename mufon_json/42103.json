It was brite and glowing but noticed it also had some glowing red coming from it. I left the camera set up after the first one, so I started filming, same conditions, clear sky. This one was moving a little bit faster, it came in my direction then moved off towards the SE. Filmed it till it was out of sight, blocked due to trees, it just drifted off. It also did not come as close as normal. I saw many more later on, but due to the brite moon the recorder was unable to focus in on them, I was up till 1:00AM tring to film as many as possible."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
