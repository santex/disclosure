It had to be about 20 minutes later from below where we saw the first object we watched this bright light come out from above the tree lne it rose very fast into the sky and then just hovered there for about 30 seconds thats when i noticed that this object was the shape of a triangle and three lights on each end of the object.it then started to move right where we where parked and then it disapeared out of no where above this field. i have never seen anything like this and it was terrifying to tell you the truth. and then about fifteen minutes later from that an other object came from the same spot we just saw an other one and it acted in the same behavior but this one took off to the left following the tree line around the lake until that one disapeared. i wish i had a camera or even just a pair of binoculars because i did not believe in what i was seeing i have know idea what the hell was going on in the sky last night."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","City":"Winchester","Case Number":"15873","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Connecticut","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/03/2009 09:03 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"A triangular shape object was moving up and down and zig zagging left to right seemed to be beeming light to the ground.","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Winchester","There were no other sightings in Winchester on or around March 3rd 2009"],"Latitude":"41.922827","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15873.html"],"Longitude":"-73.057238","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Log Number":"US-03062009-0007","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown"}
