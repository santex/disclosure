{"Date of the Event":"10/21/2007 05:20 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy sister and I were out bsck watching the meteor shower. At 5:20 AM we saw a strange dimly lit triangle shape object flying slow out of the NW toward the NE above the tree line. This was NOT a meteor. The It was illuminated dimly, almost smokey and ghost like, completely silent. We both said at the same time \"What is that!\"... We had a sense of wonder looking at it. I said \"Oh my God it's a UFO!\" It was the size of my hand with thumb stretched out away from my fingers in a V at arms length. The meteors were bright, falling to the earth faster than this dimmer object was flying. This was NO meteor. As we live in Roswell we kind of laughed about it later thinking no one was going to take us seriously about this. I decided to make this report anyway and am anxious to find out if anyone else saw what we did this morning. One more thing, our dogs and dogs in the direction the object traveled (NE) were barking during the event and a bit after."],"City":"Roswell","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"10/21/2007 05:20 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"33.399696","Summary":"triangle, dim lights, slow flying and silent.
