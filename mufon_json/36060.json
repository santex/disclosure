There was a bright object in my field of view above the road to the left (it looked like it was above central Phoenix - the box section that the I17 and the I10 make). At first I thought it was a comet or large meteorite, then I saw a second one near the first one which looked like it was going to hit the first one. Then the 1st one made a sharp zag to the left. Both continued to descend toward the ground (though still well above the skyline) and the trail died out. As the trail behind the objects went out they looked the same color as the sky - I could only see their outline, which was like an upside down teardrop. When the trail behind them had gone out completely one object made a sharp arc over the road to the right and was no longer visible behind the skyline and while I was watching that one I lost sight of the other."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.451457","Date Submitted":"02/25/2012 11:21 UTC"}
