I didn't see the fiirst orb but saw the other 2 that came after it. I followed an orb until it stopped glowing and the ascended over some tree's. I then went out the next 2 nights at about the same time and saw the same type of objects fly in the exact same pattern coming from and going in the same direction as the previous night. The first feeling we had was trying to think of things that would make sense of what we saw. The more we tried the less things made since. The strangest thing about the sighting is the thought of the orbs flying about 20 over my house and I would have never known had I not seen it for myself."]}
