At first I thought they were flares as we live on a military instillation, however the direction is all wrong. These were towards the direction of Gatesville TX and not on Post. The lights seemed to be pulsing from from one side to the other, making it seem like the object was oval in shape. The movement of the lights would go on blinking, then suddenly they would disappear and would appear seconds later in a different location. At one point I saw sparkling lights moving, at first I thought it was a flare, but this was not going up and down, it was was diagonal. These sighting happened in two occasions, only the sparkling lights happened once."],"Case Number":"13364","Latitude":"31.119129","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Killeen","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10292008-0025","Summary":"flashing lights made seem oval /sphere in shape","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Killeen","There were no other sightings in Killeen on or around October 28th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"10/28/2008 08:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Hoax","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Longitude":"-97.725576","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Unknown"}
