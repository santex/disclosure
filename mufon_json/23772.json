It was very fast but I'm shocked that more people aren't asking questions."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Circle","Region":"Georgia","Case Number":"23772","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.164735,+-82.904863(23772)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23772) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"32.164735","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/15/2010 01:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06152010-0013","Date Submitted":"06/15/2010 12:36 UTC"}
