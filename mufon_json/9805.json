At aprox 6:18 in the evening we both looked up and noticed a firey triangular object in the sky heading South East. It appeared to be the size of a large house and aprox. 45' off the horizon. The triangular object on the front end it had orange and red lights or flames on the back end of the triangle blue flames. We both viewed it streaking across the sky for aprox. 20 sec. before it vanished out of our site in the sky.. It was traveling very fast, arcing downward before it vanished. The only reference to something similar would be a Stealth Bomber traveling perpendicular to the earth, on it's side. We did not know what this was, neighter of us had ever seen any thing like it before."]}
