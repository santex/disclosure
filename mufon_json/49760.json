It was then that all four of us looked slightly upwards and saw the object move from left to right in a \"W\" pattern (sharp 90 degree angles). The object disappeared and then reappeared and repeated the same motion another sequence and then disappeared again (not to return). We all saw the object and commented on how fast it did what it did and that we didn't know what it was or at least what we knew what it wasn't... My uncle has since passed but my father, brother and myself still vividly remember the incident and feel that we (the US) or other countries do not have the technology to move at the speed or direction that this object moved."],"Summary":"Object appeared and moved in a rapid W path 2 times","Date Submitted":"08/12/2013 11:44 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49760.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49760.html"],"Region":"New York","Latitude":"40.911122","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/04/1975 08:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
