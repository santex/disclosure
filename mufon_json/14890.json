I froze, It seemed to be flashing, it sped away to a roof top across the way, stopped for about 7 seconds and disappeared into thin air. I couldn't believe my eyes. It took me a minute to adjust, I started banging on the sliding balcony doors calling for my fiance I told him what I had seen but of course he was in disbelief. That is until we heard from two other people that we knew in the apartment complex that they had witnessed the same thing. Oh yeah, I hung up on the person I was speaking to out of reaction. I couldn't believe what I was seeing."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.247973","Region":"New Jersey","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.247973,+-74.029843(14890)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14890) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01122009-0002","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
