I remember it being late evening, probably around 10pm. We both clearly saw what appeared to be a blue dot moving VERY rapidly at about 10,000 feet in an east-northeast direction and then changing direction suddenly to the southwest and finally changing direction again to it's original heading this time climbing up out of the atmosphere. The turns made by the craft were so sharp that it's path through the sky resembled a lightning bolt."],"Case Number":"30530","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-94.662952","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.986108,+-94.662952(30530)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30530) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/15/1995 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
