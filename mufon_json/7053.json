I was sitting out the back in the rockn' chair listening to the serenity and smelling the quaint scent of 2 stroke in the air. The ever present cackling of the Kookaburras. Suddenly all was quiet. In the bush things do change quite sharply but not to this magnitude. I was observing a light traveling across the sky before the silence and started to notice that it was not the airplane which i first took it to be. The \"craft\" as i call it was traveling towards me at an incredible rate, much faster than a conventional jet airplane���s it entered a range of about 200-300 meters i began to panic, i ran inside and grabbed my rifle and fired three shots at the approaching item. Two rounds hit the craft the last seemed to stop short of the object by about 10 meters and fall to the ground. The crafts speed had reached a climax speed of about 600 km per hour and was closing in being 100 meters away at the last shot fired. Then at about 20 meters away (just after I accepted my own death) it stopped hovered for about 10 minutes and intimidating me and flew away at the same rate at which it came.
