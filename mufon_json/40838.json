There were plenty of visible stationary stars. Everybody recognizes the flimsy flickering of a star. but as i looked directly up I saw a star that caught my eye. as soon as i started to stare at it it slowly moved from directly above me move northwest from my position. it hovered slowly then the orb got brighter and brighter and got bigger in dimension with the expanding light. It moved very unaturally and it had direct manipulation of the orb. then it flickered and faded into the blackness of the sky.I was definitely moved by this event and shook my core."],"Log Number":"US-07152012-0028","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around July 14th 2012"],"Object Features":"None","City":"Los Angeles","Region":"California","Longitude":"-118.463936","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40838.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40838.html"],"Latitude":"34.221723","Date of the Event":"07/14/2012 10:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:02:10","Case Number":"40838","Summary":"UFO witnessed on 7/14/12 10:00pm.
