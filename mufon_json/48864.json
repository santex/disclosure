{"trends":[],"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is in reference to any earlier sighting of a craft seen during 4th of july fireworks in chickasha. I was watching them from a street near the park where the were being fired. My wife and I saw a yellow orange light flying large circle around the area. I did not see any blinking lights or hear any sound from it though the fireworks were booming. It made several passes and left. I assumed it was a copter or plane watching the light show.
