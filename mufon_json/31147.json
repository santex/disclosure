I noticed around 10:30 and we still havent lost sight of them. I also called my cousin and friend who live in a different area of town and sure enough they saw them too! My cousin was surprised so he took off to a nearby lake, to see if he can see them better without city lights. Also a neighbor caught a suspicious triangle on his cell phone.Still trying to figure out how to download video to computer. Thanks."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"Dancing lights in front of lightning/thunder storm.","Case Number":"31147","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/24/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31147.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31147.html"],"Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-98.525432","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/25/2011 01:56 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.338844,+-98.525432(31147)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31147) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08252011-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
