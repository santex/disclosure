It made no sound while traveling across the sky and had no blinking lights. At first my wife and I thought it was an airplane but again with no noise or blinkimg lights quickly ruled that out. We both sit outside alot of the times of the day to know what an airplane sounds like. I looked at the Space Shuttle and the ISS fly over times and they both flew over at 6pm in the northern horizon not over head at 9:30 pm. My wife and I were both very taken back and surprised that we were both able to see this sight."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.220009,+-75.007904(20650)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20650) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11212009-0020","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
