{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile waiting for the ISS to fly by at out CST time zone at 5:55 PM I observed a tiny light green object the size of a peanut hovering silently and directly in front of me. This object was within 5' of my reach. It was slightly illuminated. I stared directly at this object and made sure I took notice of it's size and shape. Suddenly it just vanished. I have a friend named Jim Haydon from Capstone House in Panama City Florida that I have been in contact with over the past 6 years. I have provided him with information regarding other events in my past. This may come as a surprise but he has come in contact with a number of stones in his possession from an unknown source. He has had these analyzed at FSU. He believes he has obtained these stones from his involvement with me. This latest sighting is a surprise to me."],"Latitude":"30.160533","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date of the Event":"11/14/2010 05:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-11142010-0016","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26574.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26574.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","City":"Panama City","Summary":"A 1' light green olyptical shape appeared 5' in front of me in mid air then suddenly vanished.","Date Submitted":"11/14/2010 03:34 UTC","Longitude":"-85.656366","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.160533,+-85.656366(26574)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26574) map </A>","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Panama City","There were no other sightings in Panama City on or around November 14th 2010"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"26574","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Other"}
