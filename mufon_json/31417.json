It doesn't move.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsi'm in bliss, idaho. went down to the store around 12:30 a.m. (09\\02\\2011), and that was my first look at this 'star'. not a cloud in the sky tonight, and there are a million stars out. this thing isn't a star. it's way too big, and it appears to be way too close. anyway, went into the store and told the gals who work there about it, and they went outside to get a look. they all agreed it's way too big to be a star, and it has a shape to it. with the naked eye, the shape kind of looks like it's a 'soft' triangle. by that i mean there are no sharp edges. it kind of curves back a bit. no blinking lights on it. just white star-like color. it looks lower than normal stars. it's situated off toward the east, maybe south-east. pretty much the same direction the guy from mountain home, id mentioned. and, with the naked eye, it even looks like what he saw. only difference is, this one's not moving. as a matter of fact, it hasn't moved at all since i first saw it. not one inch. you know how, if you keep looking at one star in the sky, after a while as the earth rotates, the star appears to move. not this thing. it's still in the same place, and it's been in the same place for just about 2 hours now. what i just described is what it looks like with the naked eye. take a look at the photos i've linked to, and you'll see it actually looks nothing like i just described. here's a link to the flikr account where the pictures i took tonight are stored. i haven't done anything to them. i tried to crop them, and zoom in closer, but i couldn't figure out how to do it, so i just left them alone. (link removed to fi field) cms 09\\02\\11 09:16 cst flg click on the photos and zoom in. i think, at that point, it becomes pretty darned clear this isn't your normal every day star. p.s. it's now 2:35 a.m. it's still there. just hanging there. frankly, i'm starting to kind of hope this is just a normal star. it's kind of giving me the creeps now."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-114.945541","Region":"Idaho","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31417.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31417.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.925452,+-114.945541(31417)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31417) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
