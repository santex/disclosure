It appeared to be approximately around Harlem avenue at the time. It continued East over Tweeter and Carmax and eventually towards 57 where I lost sight. At first it looked like several airplane lights but they werent moving that fast and were in a distinct v pattern like geese migrating. It was also not moving fast enough to be planes. Possibly helicopters but I couldnt hear any noise and the lights were fairly large. Took pics but was driving at night when I did it. The quality is poor. You can see 3 of the lights in the bottom right hand corner. The snowy objects are my dirty windshield and the 3 white squares are my vehicle stickers. The object was about out of range when I took it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.543851,+-87.792399(44979)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44979) map </A>","Region":"Illinois","Date Submitted":"01/03/2013 12:42 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Latitude":"41.543851","Longitude":"-87.792399","Summary":"6 lights flying in V pattern over 191st headed E / SE towards tweeter and 57","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44979.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44979.html"],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Tinley Park","There were no other sightings in Tinley Park on or around January 2nd 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"44979","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
