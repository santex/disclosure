reportstate section director, mufonlasighting date: 7\\23\\02sighting time: 10:15\\10:20 pmsighting location: marina del rey, caonly a few minutes prior to my neighbors call, id gone to bed in the forwardv-berth of my 30 catalina sailboat on which i live aboard. when leslie scottogalbreath called me by phone with alarm in his voice, i was surprised to findhim reporting a ufo to me (i voiced my doubt as to his sincerity because scottois a comedian who constantly uses my interest in ufos as material for routine comedic assassinations of my character). he reiterated that he was not kidding and that i should come topsideimmediately for a look. i popped the hatch over my head and moved upward on deckto see something which made absolutely no sense whatsoever:above me nearly 90 degrees but slightly north and heading directly overhead tothe south-southwest was a brightly lit array of lights which looked like theywere configured to an invisible structure which all connected to what appearedto be a central jet aircraft. flying at about 15 to 18 thousand feet, theatmospheric bounce seemed to illuminate the bottom of what looked like a typicaljet, but that is where typical ended.there is always jet noise from being very close to lax.. this was the case asthis object went over. there were other jets in the area. what sound i mighthave attributed to this object would not be accurate based on���our proximity to los angeles airport. to the right and left side of this central craft was a formation of whatlooked like rotating red navigational beacons. to the right were a series ofthree outboard beacons, the first one being the only one that was not rotating,constant, and red. each beacon was equally spaced on either side of this craft.the distance from each beacon to one another was at least three full wingspansof the central crafts main wingspan. that wingspan was approximately mythumbnail width at arms length. relative to the central craft, none of theserotating red lights moved independently of one another as if to be fixed to somesuperstructure and connected somehow to the central craft. to the left of this craft and starting outboard at the same distance as theright side were approximately six of these beacons making the left wing appear much longer. at the farthest outboard end of the left side formation wasa smaller white light trailing behind its respective leader as if it were beingdragged by this leading edge beacon. this gave the impression that this wingwas squared off at the left end. the distance from these two lights whichformed this termination was about four fuselage lengths of the central craft. there did not appear to be any visible structure to the larger wing formed bythese outer beacons, though, there was absolutely no variation in spacingvisible which might have been caused by independent buffeting from windturbulence or speed differences. these beacons and lights seemed fixed to arigid but invisible framework.each red rotating beacon seemed larger than what it should have appeared to havebeen for its distance and did not seem to be attached to the bottom ofanything like individual fighter aircraft or the like. they looked like they were just oversizedflying red beacons, clear and bright. i dont remember anything significantabout what should have been normal sized navigational lighting on the centralcraft.if there was a \"superstructure\" to this formation, the sweep angle of the mainwing from the central crafts leading edge was the source for any \"attachment\". this formations angle might have been pitched slightly forward of the angle ofthe central craft wings leading edge.the reasoning for such a configuration made no sense. any superstructurenecessary to keep such a formation fully fixed in place as it appeared, wouldhave been ripped apart by air turbulence from the speed this craft traveled at. on the other hand, if there was a much larger main craft partially \"cloaked\",then this would explain such an odd sighting.the duration of our sighting was approximately a minute and a half until this configuration of lights and craft movedout of sight to our south southwest. that path would have taken it directlyacross the western end of the lax active runways. we watched these lights from our different positions in the marina about 30yards from each other. scotto was watching through binoculars with our mutualfriend larry hansen.since that night mufonla has received at least two additional reports fromdifferent cities within la county. these are hawthorne and silverlake. thewitness in silverlake took several seconds of videotape. our director ofinvestigations will assign an independent investigator to these reports and,because im an artist, i will also illustrate what i witnessed.mark hunzikerstate section director, mufonlawilliam h casey wrote: this is the other report of apparently the same object over silverlake afew minutes after the fist sighting. mark also saw the same object fly over hissailboat in the same time frame, but i dont have the details of his sighting.i talked to the witness (jesus guzman) last night and he would be happyto show us the few seconds of video that he took. i left a message with ralph tocall jesus (what a thought...lol) as soon as possible. i will be out of town for a week beginning tomorrow, so ann, if you areavailable, please coordinate this. since steve has volunteered for the hawthornesighting, maybe he couldresearch both?bill c.--------- forwarded message ----------from: to: \"william h casey\" date: wed, 24 jul

there were about 20 lights flashing a cherry red color and all ofthem were flashing. objects heading south east. they started off in atriangular pattern and started forming a cresent shape. some objects werefurther away and not part of the configuration.state: californiacounty: los angelescity: silverlakecountry: united statestime: 10:21am\\pm: pmtimezone: pacific : pacific time (us &

reilly>> email: riles35@aol.com>> desc: i was in the city of hawthorne with two friends and we were outsidetalking. some red lights approaching from the north (going south) caught ourattention. we saw a very huge boomerang or v shaped object, with a bright whitelight at the \"nose\", and red blinking lights around its perimeter (maybe four orfive on either side of the white light). i thought it was an airplane at first. we were all pretty impressed with its massive size and we kept the object insight. it traveled north to south, appearing to follow the coastline, and wekept sight of it until it was too far away to see in the southern horizon. it was totally silent and seemed to glide slowly across the sky. this occurred at about 10:15 p.m. (give or take a few minutes) on tuesday, july 23, 2002, and i am totally shocked it did not make the news - it flew right over the lax flight path.>please limit your narrative to 2000 words (equivalent to 6 typed pages)."],"Case
