When I uploaded the pictures to my computer, I noticed a weirdly-shaped orb in one of them. I showed it to a friend and she said it looked like a cigar-shaped \"UFO\" and that I should submit it to MUFO. I did not notice the object in the sky when I took the picture. It was a sunny day. I have other photos I took that afternoon, and see nothing in any of them. The orb or whatever is shaped really strangely, though, and I wanted to submit it. The first photo is straight from the camera, the second, I cropped and used some contrast in Photoshop to try and get a better idea of the shape."],"Source":"MUFON"}
