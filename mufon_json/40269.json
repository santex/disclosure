The video could not be attached to the first one but is attached to this one. I was walking east on 78th street to third avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn at 10:38PM on July 4th, 2012. The color, light and motion of the object immediately caught my eye. It was a pulsating red and orange orb. Since I witnessed the meteor streak across the Wisconsin sky in April of 2010 I am particularly attuned to celestial phenomena. This was something different. Unlike the meteor or even a firework its motion was not constant. It was choppy and appeared to start and stop and change directions. I had a small video camera on me and was able to capture a few seconds of the object in the sky. However there was too much artificial light interference and obstructions like trees and tall buildings for the video to be good. The video is in slow motion at about half speed. The object can be seen at 10 seconds and again at 20 and 25 seconds."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40269.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40269.html"],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.632712,+-74.023129(40269)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40269) map </A>","Summary":"Pulsating Orb Bay Ridge, Brooklyn","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-74.023129","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:38 UTC","Case Number":"40269","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07052012-0093"}
