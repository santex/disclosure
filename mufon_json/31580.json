While waiting for a friend I was meeting for dinner, I was looking up at the sky when I saw what I thought to be planes.....but 5 so close together. My first thought was....how can air traffic control be choreographing this cluster. Then I recognized the movement........the larger being still......a smaller object moving right slowly....then fast...then changing direction. the 3 smallest were close together....moving up and down right and left.....the medium sized one, at a still moment....vanished.....the 3 smaller ones vanished one by one....the larger became more brilliant...like it was ablaze.....then slowly disappeared. It was a remarkable experience. When my friend finally arrived, he commented that I was glowing and my eyes were sparkling. I had to share the excitement of what I saw. I was actually tingling all over. I waited to see the news the next day.....but nothing. I contacted a friend who led me to this sight. I would love to know what I saw. Next step is to learn how to work the video app on my phone."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"09/06/2011 12:56 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.844184,+-75.760924(31580)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31580) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/04/2011 08:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31580.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31580.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"40.844184","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
