The object looked like a line with two lines crossing it, i have attatched a picture of the shape of the UFO as it was so unusual and i would love to hear if another of this shape has ever been captured. The object moved in stages, travelling quickly then pausing then continuing moving, it suddenly turned once i was taking the second picture and disappeared.
