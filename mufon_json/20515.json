I looked to the south and saw a large yellow pancake shaped light hovering in the sky. My girlfriend saw it to . It hovered still and had a moving light going across the front of it like the knight rider car. We both witnessed it hover for around 5 min before we went back inside. 20 min later we went to leave and it was gone. At first we thought it was the goodyear blimp. It did not move however and it was very strange."],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Canton","There were 2 other sightings in Canton on or around November 14th 2009"]}
