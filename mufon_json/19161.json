I noticed a shooting star shoot across the sky. A few moments later I noticed to bright \"stars\" that were sitting still begin to move, keeping perfect distance and moving in sync. They moved across the sky from west to NE for about a minute until they disappeared like the lights had been turned off. The area where the \"stars\" had been seemed to be surrounded by planes from all directions. As we watched we noticed a plane in the Eastern sky that seemed to be following a dim light moving in a zigzag motion until it disappeared also."],"Latitude":"40.200077","City":"Muncie","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Muncie","There were no other sightings in Muncie on or around September 8th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19161.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19161.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/08/2009 11:01 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"19161","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Log Number":"US-09082009-0034","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.38315","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.200077,+-85.38315(19161)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19161) map </A>","Summary":"2 non blinking moving lights","Weather Factors":"None"}
