Ithought it was strange but nothing special untill this \"star\" suddenly started flickering and shot north across the sky going from 70 degress above the horizon to 20 degress above the horizon in about two seconds vanishing. I told my wife about the object and she said it was a plane as we live in a high airtraffic area. Today July 29, 2007 at 10 o'clock pm eastern time my wife called and said she saw the same thing. The sky is overcast and she is about 5 miles south of where I saw mine in beltsville.She said a star caught her eye in the overcaast, it was the only star visible when all of a sudden it shot westward from about 70 degrees above horizon to 20 degrees above horizon in just a few seconds. My wife does not believe in ufos but is puzzled as am I with a strong astronomy background. Was wodering if you fine folks might have a cclue."],"Weather Factors":"Rain","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Laurel","There were no other sightings in Laurel on or around July 26th 2007"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07292007-0008","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-76.839516","City":"Laurel","Date of the Event":"07/26/2007 02:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON"}
