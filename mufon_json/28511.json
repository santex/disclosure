The morning was clear and the constellations were easily visible especially Orion and Canis Major. Coming out of the south and moving directly north was what seemed to be a high flying plane. I figured it was probably a UPS or FED EX plane, but it didn't have its traditional red and green nav lights. The craft had two white lights, one behind the other and neither blinked. I didn't think much about it until a beam of light turned on and flashed sideways a couple times for about four seconds then turned off. I thought to myself, what plane at that altitude would use a searchlight? There was no sound, and if it was a helicopter looking for something it would have been much lower and more obvious to me at what it was. The object continued to move across the sky to the north and disappeared behind the trees."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
