From the small hill you can see towards Elgin, OK and beyond to Duncan, OK and OKC. I noticed a object traveling at high speed parallel to the ground and then abruptly at a 40 degree angle shoot up into the atmosphere and disapear. Not sure if I observed a meteor entering the atmosphere, perhaps skipping off the atmosphere or a rocket from a MRLS at FT Sill. I doubt the rocket though as I was looking to the NE away from FT Sill and any impact ranges. MRLRS ranges are west of post not east of I-44 in the direction of OKC. Maybe a meteor observed along the horizon that probably entered over the east coast? Light refraction? but the abrubt change in direction is what caught my eye after it had run parrallel along the ground. I could not tell the distance to the object but it was moving as fast as a meteor would. perhaps others saw it?"],"Date of the Event":"03/01/2012 11:40 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/02/2012 08:33 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.780347,+-98.292273(36212)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36212) map </A>","Region":"Oklahoma","Summary":"While driving, crested a hill and observed a object shoot up into sky","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
