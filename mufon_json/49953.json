Only observed about a minute of object's flight. A reddish pulsing light moved slowly from the south to the north. Not able to ascertain the altitude, but it seemed to be rather low. It looked like a paper lantern but speed was constant and there was no deviation in direction. The light seemed to flicker like a flame. I lost visual of light behind tall trees. Came online to see if anyone else has reported seeing it. The report from Orlando, FL is VERY similar to what I witnessed."],"Longitude":"-74.401981","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08172013-0039","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49953.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49953.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.067984,+-74.401981(49953)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49953) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/17/2013 11:01 UTC","Summary":"Observed slow moving red/pink pulsing light moving from south to north.","Latitude":"40.067984","Region":"New Jersey"}
