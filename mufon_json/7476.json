It was very, very bright, more so than any other night. For some reason I kept watching it as I continued on I-96 heading home. Something about it just seemed odd. I can���t specifically say what was odd about it, only that my feeling was it was not as it seemed. Traffic was very light at this time so I was able to concentrate more on the light as I was driving. After a little time of watching it, by the time I crossed over the bridge (Grand River underneath I-96), I noticed this bright white light was not Venus, but was actually moving at a steady pace across the night sky heading north. Ok I thought, it���s got to be a plane, but then I thought how could this be a plane, it was too darn bright. So I kept watching, waiting and watching for the blinking lights to verify that this was in fact a plane, but there were none. No blinking lights anywhere. It was a solid bright white. Now, as I am getting closer to it, or it to me, it moves across I-96 in front of me still heading north, but now has changed shape slightly into an oblong, bright white light. As I���m watching this I���m still looking for the blinking lights to verify this was a plane, although it in no way resembled what a plane looks like at night. As I get closer yet, just rounding the curve at Granger Landfill, heading to yet another bridge that runs over I-96 I can still see it, but it���s now way to the right of my windshield and is getting bigger in size, and lower in the sky. After maybe five seconds of staring at it I had to look out my passenger window because it was no longer visible through my windshield. At this point I was now looking out my passenger window at this V-shaped solid white light. That���s all it was���a solid, bright white V. No blinking lights, no strobes, no breaks or circles of lights, it was a solid bright white flying V in the night sky. I was in disbelief watching this until I nearly ran off the road, the rumble strips brining my attention back to my driving. I then did a quick check in my rear view mirror and looked to the lane next to me for cars and there were a few. A spurt of traffic had caught up to me as I was now only doing 45mph. When I looked over again out my passenger side window, after passing underneath the bridge, the trees blocked my view and I could no longer see the V. I immediately phoned a friend of mine who lives in the area this thing was heading. She answered the phone very keyed-up and told me before I could say anything that something huge just passed over, next to her house. Needless to say I told her what I had just seen and we both were on the phone as I now took my exit ramp, then made my way over to her home searching for this thing. I took a couple of side roads, drove by her house, and then drove around the country roads, but it was gone. Soon after I returned home, which was now around 11:40pm she hung up with me to call the airport to ask them about air traffic and if there was anything in the area around the time I had seen this, and the time it passed near her home. The person she spoke with in the control tower said at that time they had noticed nothing on radar and then even asked the person a chair over who also said they had seen nothing on radar. This person said that it wouldn���t be until next week before they would be able to have any more information because it was a Friday night. They said they would check the radar returns over the weekend and the person she needed to talk with would be in next week. As soon as I get this information I will report their findings. Thanks UPDATE: As I was getting ready to file this report today my friend called to let me know she had spoke with the FAA at the airport. The man said there was nothing there. No one had left him any messages on any of this and that was it. He offered no help of any kind."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Lansing","There were no other sightings in Lansing on or around July 13th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.742435"}
