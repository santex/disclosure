I saw it immediately. A white ball streaking across the sky at a tremendous speed in Essaouira Morocco on April 1, 2010 during the day. My camera says it was taken at 3:29:08 but I didn't have the timezone set for Morocco, it was still set for my country so it was probably 11:30:08 I'm including the original photo and then a cropped version. I enhanced the pixel count and color to make it stand out more so you can see it better. I don't know what the photo is, but it was moving at a tremendous speed. Maybe a meteorite. Maybe something else. Don't know."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"44568","Region":"Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"31.513056","Date Submitted":"12/15/2012 04:28 UTC","Summary":"White ball going very very very fast","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44568.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44568_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44568_submitter_file2__ufocloseup.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44568.html"],"Longitude":"-9.769722"}
