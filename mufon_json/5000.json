Looked North-West at 11:00am..Thought object was first a bird then a balloon. It was very slow moving.Then noticed it was rotating. Changing from small sphere to football shape. Noticed Dome or knob on top and something like a rod sticking out of the dome.Ran into the house to get my binoculars and lost sight of it. Neighbur said it went in the clouds. This was at 8:41pm. This really caught my interest. Blimps hover but I dont think they rotate,Hot air balloons might but there was no basket."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.50867,+-73.553992(5000)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5000) map </A>","Log Number":"CA-06282006-0004","Country":"Canada","City":"Montreal","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Montreal","There were no other sightings in Montreal on or around June 28th 2006"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/28/2006 08:28 UTC","Region":"Quebec"}
