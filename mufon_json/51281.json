Just to clarify, when I took the picture I did not see this object so definitely was moving very fast and also I haven't heard any noise at all. Also, I was shooting a lot of pictures one after another and checking the pictures taken previous to this one as well as the ones taken after, nothing out of the ordinary was visible. I cannot really specify the direction of the object just I can say I was about 100 m from the blue cave within the glacier (is some artificial grotto dug out for tourists) with my back towards the blue cave and I took the picture turned slightly to my left. I realized what I captured only 1 week later while returning from vacation and checking the pictures. From my knowledge no stealth planes are in that area or any other military planes as its very close to Switzerland and I seriously doubt France would risk. Though I am quite skeptical about this I would appreciate your feedback as I am still not sure what it might be."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
