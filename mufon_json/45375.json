I put something back into the fridge and all of a sudden the entire kitchen was bathed in a bright blue light. I grabbed my pan off the stove so that it did not burn and stood looking at 3 bright blue lights hovering about 200 feet away and about 60 feet high. We have bay windows in the kitchen and it was coming through the western most window. It was there for about 15 seconds or so (seemed a lot longer) then they just vanished. The next morning I want out and inspected the ground around where this thing would have been, since there was snow all around it was very easy to see that there was no sigh of anything being there. No car or truck tracks or anything else. A say no truck tracks because I thought it might be hunters on the land without permission. The lights were so blue that I didn't think it would be hunters but I checked anyway."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in La Salle","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"45375","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/23/2013 01:04 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45375.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45375.html"],"Summary":"Lights hovering just west of our house","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"La Salle"}
