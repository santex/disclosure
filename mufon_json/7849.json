I looked up to the sky and spent a moment observing the stars, when movement caught my eye. coming out of the distance toward my house was a what appeared to be the brightest star in the sky, my immeadiate thought was that i had seen a shooting star but this shooter moved across the sky rather than toward the ground and had no tail as i would imagine somthing burning in the atmosphere would have.( not an asteroid then)It was not an aircraft as it was definately too high and had only one distinguishable light source. after the initial sighting had bamboozeled me, I called on my girlfriend to get conformation that i wasn't crazy! She agreed that she had never witnessed such a thing before either, the bright object continued on its course over my house, watched closely by my girlfriend and I, and once more off into the distance."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"09/02/2007 10:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Summary":"too higher than a plane, no tail so not a comet. travelling straight at many hundreds of miles an hour.","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Aberdeen","There were no other sightings in Aberdeen on or around September 2nd 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"GB-09052007-0007","Country":"United Kingdom","Tags":"City","Latitude":"57.149717"}
