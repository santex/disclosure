At first I thought I was looking at a particularly bright twinkling star, but after looking back at it, it appeared to be VERY slowly moving to the south east. It reminded me of the pictures of a fighter jet because of the \"wings\" slanting backward. I only watched it briefly the first night because of the coldness outside. The second night at about 30 minutes later I witnessed the same thing. I told my husband about it and he saw it only faintly because of poor eyesight. He agreed that it appeared to be traveling to the sw. We were unable to focus on it with the small camera we have. If sketching it, you would draw a capital \"V\" with a straight line extending a ways of the \"V\" points, to a short distance through the middle to somewhat below the bottom of the \"V.\""],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"03/09/2013 10:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New York","Log Number":"US-03102013-0011","Date Submitted":"03/10/2013 05:49 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46116.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46116.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
