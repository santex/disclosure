The event grew louder and louder as it approached our house and I jumped out of the Hot tub to see if there was an aircraft that was going to crash nearby. The only thing I could assume was that it was a jet airliner, but it was getting way to loud and way to close. The sound was also somehow wrong and a lower tone than a jumbo jet, and it sounded like an electrical transformer hum, but at a deeper and yet sharper tonality with a bit of a throb to it. The craft flew nearly over our ranch and was nothing but a dark spot (or lack of cloud reflection) in the sky against the clouds. No lights at all. You could feel the strong humming in the air and my body was vibrating with the noise as it passed heading up towards the hills and on to Gunnison Colorado. Never heard or felt anything like it."],"Longitude":"-107.868474","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"9706","City":"Montrose","Object Features":"Unknown"}
