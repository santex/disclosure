I am 22 years old , and this was somthing highly unusul . It was North of my location perhaps a mile away and about 400-500 feet high , on Hyw 29 outside of the city of Charlotte , very close the Hwy 485 by pass and close the the Charlotte Motor Speedway.At first I thought it was some type of Helicopter or Blimp , but I quickly realized it was something entirely different than anything I have ever seen before. It gave me an extremely eerie feeling and gave me quite a sense of anxiety . It moved steady forward with up and down movements in a sort circular pattern , without any sound . I then dissapeared below the tree line from my position. There were no other witnesses at my location at this time . This is in a very populated area and I would thing other in the area made this observation."],"Date of the Event":"07/16/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Charlotte on or around July 16th 2006"],"Date Submitted":"07/16/2006 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5098.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5098.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Charlotte","Longitude":"-80.839547","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"SMOOTH,METALLIC,NOT SHINY , BRUSHED METAL LOOK, NO NOISE,NO MARKINGS, APPX 30-40 FT ACROSS","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.234787,+-80.839547(5098)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5098) map </A>"}
