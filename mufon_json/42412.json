Shortly before the movie was over, my oldest son (12 yrs old) and his friend approached us and told us about a couple of objects they had just seen. They had been sitting in a separate location from the rest of our party. They described two objects that flew overhead. They said the objects were hard to see and based on what they said seemed to be semi-transparant with a distorting affect on the stars above. My son's friend described one as having a dotted or dashed outline. The descriptions of shape were various: (triangle, boomerang, \"W\" and \"Y\" shaped). Both objects followed a similar trajectory which I understood to be North to South. My son's friend described a wavy characteristic associated with one he described as \"Y\" shaped. They said the objects just faded or blended in with the sky. The boys had been looking at the sky to try to see meteors. One of my other sons, which was sitting with us, had seen a meteor earlier, so the other boys may had seen it also which may have promted them to look for more. They appeared excited from what they had seen and later that night they sat in the front yard to try to see more of these objects, but did not notice any others."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42412.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42412.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-09092012-0014","Case Number":"42412","Longitude":"-97.337252","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle, Other","Sighting Duration":"00:00:08"}
