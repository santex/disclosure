The witness, whom I have previously interviewed for an earlier case, reported that she, her mother, and the reporting witness' young son were driving south on Interstate 35, South of Des Moinies, on Christmas eve 2004. They observed what appeared to be very bright \"football lights\" turn on and then go off, so they pulled off onto the New Virginia exit to investigate.
