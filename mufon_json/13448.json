{"Date of the Event":"10/31/2008 08:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Saturn-like, Sphere","divs":["sighting detailstime approx: 8:30 pm edt 10\\31\\2008 i went to the store and from the store parking lot noticed what at first glance appeared to be a flare. i live north of a military base so it would be normal. i watched it for a good minute and realized it was in the wrong area to be from the base. it also did not drop in altitude or flicker in any form. i proceeded to drive home. on the drive i kept an eye on it. it appeared to just sit there at about 300 500 feet, but it is hard to tell while driving. once on jones rd., i continued through the first curve, heading for the 90 degree right ahead. while in the first curve i had to dim my lights for an oncoming car. i was almost to the right turn and still watching the ufo, i switched on my high beams again. at that moment the ufo dropped in altitude and proceeded to move quickly to the right through the trees. i made the turn and watched through the trees as the ufo disappeared from sight. after arriving home i stood outside for about 10 minutes looking all around. i haven't at this time 10:12 pm 10\\31\\2008 viewed it again. this is my second time in 25 years viewing a ufo. the other in 1983 was in the same county and did about the same thing."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","City":"Cataula, Georgia","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"10/31/2008 08:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.655278,+-84.868611(13448)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13448) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10312008-0025","Latitude":"32.655278","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-84.868611","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Thats not a Flare","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cataula, Georgia","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"13448","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13448.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13448_submitter_file1__foofighter01.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13448_submitter_file2__foofighter02.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13448_submitter_file3__foofighter03.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13448.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City"}
