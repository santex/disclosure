I slowed to watch the 3 aircraft which were not normal aircraft as their lights seemed to pulsate and flicker randomly orange. I was close enough to see the shape. There were no wings or rotors and they made no noise. They looked like flying \"Jacks\" in the sky. They were not moving quickly and they maintained a due south course. As I could not turn around on the highway I lost sight of them as they moved further south."],"Latitude":"42.912468","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Case Number":"50188","Tags":"City"}
