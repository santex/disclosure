Noticed a contrail which I thought was strange since it was dark and no moon at the time. Very tight contrail also. Then noticed a red shape in front of it going from the north to southwest. Different shades of red, one very bright. Object was very very high up and maintained the contrail. Erratic movement while heading south then turned to the east. Still moving erratically. Lost it in the street light. Happy to see that someone else noticed it. It was not a plane."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Re: 25575 - Red with contrail","Case Number":"25577","Log Number":"US-09262010-0016","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"32.828512","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Hurst","There were no other sightings in Hurst on or around September 26th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.828512,+-97.164268(25577)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25577) map </A>"}
