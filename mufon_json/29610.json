Look closely and saw a circular orange ball the size of a big star. It moved slowly and straight like a sattelite but it was moving a bit quicker than a satellite usually does. It glided very smoothely through the sky dimming out occaisionaly then the light just went out. I was a little spooked when I saw this object, i thought it could be a sattelite but I have never seen one with that vivid of an orange color. Especially going over our small town."],"Longitude":"-97.128244","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"49.900804","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Winnipeg","There was one other sighting in Winnipeg on or around June 17th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"29610","Country":"Canada","Region":"Manitoba","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
