At first, I thought that it was someone shooting off fireworks because it is that same sort of red and the path was slightly in an arc. It wasn't blinking, but rather pulsating. It flew in a path over my house. I ran in and grabbed my glasses and a witness, and went out the back of the house. It traveled for a while on the same path, then reversed it's path and then hovered. Then it rapidly got smaller and smaller until it was gone. I can't believe no one else saw it!"],"Object Shape":"Oval","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
