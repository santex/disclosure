It was bright green and glowing and was a little smaller than the size of the sun. I had no idea what it was when i first noticed it because it was too big to be anything identifiable. It seemed to be over 10000 ft high but no higher than 14000. I spotted it midway in the sky and it quickly sank below the horizon never to be seen again. I didnt even see it for more than 45 seconds. I was stunned when i saw it and immediatly thought it was a UFO. I was excited and scared and looked all around for other signs of UFo's. I considered calling the highway patrol but knew they would do nothing about it."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Grand Island","There were no other sightings in Grand Island on or around January 10th 2009"],"Longitude":"-98.333232","Case Number":"14891","Date of the Event":"01/10/2009 04:37 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14891.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14891.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
