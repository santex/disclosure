However I kept watching and it turned into a fantastic display of several flashing lights almost like fireflies dancing around in the sky. They would flash and switch position very rapidly, sometimes making right and left sharp turns. The lights were not a steady flash but random flickering. This appeared to be several objects (5-7) and their movement did not have any set pattern as to where they were going or doing, again reminded me of fireflies but instead of an orange hue, their appeared white with slight tint of green. About 35 minutes of activity...fantastic! My wife also witnessed this for about 10 minutes but decided to go back to bed. She stated that it was interesting and had no idea as to what they may be. In the end they just stopped. In short, I feel really good about what I saw and I hope to see them again. This was my first UFO sighting."],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Other","City":"Franklin","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"North Carolina","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10922.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10922.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/26/2008 12:10 UTC"}
