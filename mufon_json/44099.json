Friend and I were stargazing outside a party. 2. Friend saw first. 3. Initially thought that it was Rigel, but it blinked and changed color. Also, Rigel was nearby by our vision, and the object was somewhat brighter than the star. 4. Reasoned that it was not a helicopter or an airplane as it was too high for the former and too stationary for the latter. 5. Reasoned that it was not a satellite as it moved randomly. 6. Object appeared to change direction randomly and blinked red and white lights. 7. Felt thrilled at the possibility of seeing something controlled by external intelligent beings. 8. Object remained relatively stationary. 9. Another similar object seen in the horizon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.712486,+-84.058938(44099)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44099) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11232012-0007","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.712486","Case Number":"44099","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Beavercreek","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44099.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44099.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw light near Rigel blinking red and white.","Longitude":"-84.058938","Date Submitted":"11/23/2012 11:46 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
