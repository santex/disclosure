This was at 2:30 am. As we left town we saw on the right side in through the trees, a light. At first I was just thinking it was a light on in someones house, until my son pointed out there are no houses through there. About 5 minutes goes by, maybe a little less, there is a light up in the trees in front of us. I was trying to make out if it was a street light when it disappeared. As we got out to the middle of nowhere a car was coming. We could see headlights. My headlights had not reached that far yet and it appeared as though we would be going up hill, because it was higher than us. As we approached it, I realised it was just sitting there. The lights looked odd because there was a glow between them. I began to slow down when the lights disappeared. As we passed the area where it was, it was gone. There was no place for it to go and there was no hill after all. That was when I realised the object had to have been in the air."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Granisle","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Summary":"Headlights that hover and disappear","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Granisle","There were no other sightings in Granisle on or around February 5th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-02132008-0012","Region":"British Columbia"}
