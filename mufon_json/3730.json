At 6:30 pm I looked out the window and notice a large flat object slowly coming from the front of the airplane to the back of the plane. I was seated in a window seat on the left side of the plane. The passenger seated diretly in front of me also saw the object. It was large and very flat with no sign of a cockpit. The object was either rectangular or traiangle shape. When we arrived in Charlotte Douglas, NC around 8:11pm, I asked the pilot, what was that plane that pass our plane around 6:30pm. The pilot said, what plane? He said I'm sure the tower was tracking it. The conversation was very strange.
