i saw nearly the same thing in april of 2007 at approximately 0330am flying over my home in northeastern kentucky. i was having a bout with insomnia, and decided to go outside and videotape and observe some of the strange goings on in the airspace above my home. i saw a light flying through the air, coming from the north and headed due south and it was making no noise. i decided to start taping it when to my joy, i noticed another light approximately 200 feet away, on the firsts starboard wing, and i distinctly remember saying, \"hmmm, that's strange, the one on the left is flying awfully close to the one on the right, but it's cool, because there are two of them!\" within about 10 seconds of making the above statement, my knees almost buckeled, and a great deal of fear came over me, because it dawned on me that, no, i wasn't looking at two different lights on two different aircraft, but i was looking at one huge aircraft!!! and it was flying extremely low! i mean, it looked like it was just barely clearing a large grove of huge probably two century old oak trees, which are at least 50 feet tall. it was then that i noticed, out of the corner of my right eye, that there was another light, to the right (port side) about 200 feet away...so this thing was h-u-g-e! i remember saying outloud, \"oh my god! this is one huge f-ing thing, and it's so damn low, that yes, i am scared [cms\\tg\\pd] right now!!!\" it was then that i truly realized the enormity of the thing. it was at least 300-400 wide and maybe that much long, if not more! it had three white lights on each \"corner\", and one red light dead center underneath, whith six pale white\\yellow lights in rows of two center around the red light underneath. it also had deep blue looking lights on the underside of each corner. it was so huge. it flew directly over top of me, my house and my yard, headed due south. i had my video camera running the whole time, and i know that my voice probably sounded at least an octave higher in pitch, and that i was talking twice as fast as normal. i was able to clearly see all of these details, as there was a full moon, and it was in the low in the sky in the south\\southwest, with a few clouds, but mostly clear. when this thing flew over me, i believe i was more scared because it was so low, rather than the fact that it was huge! i was so big, that when it flew over, it literally blocked out the star field for about 10-20 seconds, which i know that i stated while i taped it flying over me. it appeared to be completely stable in flight, was quiet, but had a very low pitched rumble to it...you could feel it more than you could hear it. it was really creepy sounding. it sounded like a sub woofer which had a really low frequency noise on it, turned up and placed on a carpeted floor. weird. it flew really slow. extremely slow...like a blimp in flight. come to think of it, it might have sounded like a blimp's engine, except lots more quiet. also, and this is really strange...as i watched it fly over, i noticed that a willow tree which was in my front yard, and which had not yet bloomed, or had leaves, started shaking. i mean, the really longs and slender branches, were almost quivering. i tried to videotape them, but i'm sure you could not see them in the darkness, but they were shaking. what drew my attention to this anomaly was that i heard them first. i then noted that there was absolutely no wind, so i was further creeped out! i then watched it fly on a continuous southerly heading, and approximately 1\\2 mile away, it made a slow bank to starboard, and floated toward the south\\southwest, which gave me a really good look at it. it was not black, but almost an air superiority gray color, and it was definetely triangular shaped. after i saw this, i came into the house, and was shaking. i even woke my wife up, and she immediately sensed something had shaken me up. lastly, although i did videotape this...thing, i have never, gone back and reviewed the tape, because it creeped me out so bad! i still have it, but i have not worked up the gumption to re-live that period in time!"],"Date Submitted":"03/31/2007 03:45 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/31/2007 03:45 UTC","Latitude":"38.238468","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15992.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15992.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Kentucky"}
