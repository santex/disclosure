I was facing north shooting photos of their pool with the park in the background as part of a photo shoot to be used for their advertising. I shot several photos of the same general area with my Canon Power Shot 5.0MP using the pop-out video screen to preview my shots. At no time did I see the object... it must of been moving pretty fast! It did not appear in any other shots but I later found this one photo with the object centered in the photo! I have seen satellites and this is not one. It was not a plane or a bird... It made no noise and was there and gone without bring any attention to itself."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.621331,+-116.204326(22407)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22407) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"Disk shaped object captured in photo over Boise, Idaho July 25th, 2005.","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were no other sightings in Boise on or around July 25th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
