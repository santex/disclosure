At this point, I was awake laying in bed hoping to get back to sleep, clock now reading 5:17 am, as I rolled over and stared out the window at two dim white stars in the sky to the left of the Grants Pass Peak, I then noticed that the star to the right of the other one was moving very slowly eastward. As it moved slowly through the easterly sky the dim light got brighter and it appeared to get larger in size. I jumped out of bed to watch it out my window as it continued to move to the east and to my surprise it started zig zagging upward and downward in the sky for a few seconds. At this point I knew for sure it wasn't any airplane or helicopter. It went back to its previous position and headed east once again. Still in my view, I continued watching it and then it did something I didn���t expect it to do and that is drop downward in the sky and circle around heading westward back in the direction it came. The bright light and large size appeared to be getting smaller as it started dimming as it continuing moving westerly and then it disappeared. I was thinking I had seen the last of it when it appeared further to the west and after a few seconds of watching it once more disappeared for the last time. Our house guest saw something similar to what I saw eight hours previous while using our spa."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.442627","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Region":"Oregon","Log Number":"US-03212008-0002","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO Flying Over Grants Pass Peak in Murphy Oregon","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"03/06/2008 05:17 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9999_submitter_file1__Viewbedroomspic1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9999.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.442627,+-123.319992(9999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9999) map </A>","Case Number":"9999","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Grants Pass","There were no other sightings in Grants Pass on or around March 6th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/06/2008 05:17 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON"}
