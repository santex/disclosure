{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["sighting detailsit was 8;05 p.m was washing car in driveway. my girlfriend came out to see what i was doing. she then, in a shocked voice said\" what the heck is that thing up there in the sky. i turned and looked in a southeast direction and saw something ive never seen before and never seen reported on the t.v. a huge fireball was flying through the air at a leisurly pace towards us. it was pulsating with a color pattern that isnt quite natural. it was pulsating with red\\orange then pulsated with an orange white..the white color i could only make out after the object came closer. the object changed direction a few times fading to the s.e then comming back. i would like to say that the hight was about the hight of 10 degrees above horizon. as i watched the object my girlfreind had to go back into the house and when she left i watched the object begin to move towards the south and climb in hight untill i could no longer see it. the whole thing lasted about 15 minutes. after the incident i came inside to check the news of any wrecks or meteors in the area..i found nothing so far. note: my girlfriend hates u.f.o stuff and syfy so its shocking in itself at least to me that she said it may be a ufo while being totally serious. sadly i did not take pictures or video but would bet my life that noone could explain it to me without comming to the same conclusion as i have...unless breaking news comes on tonight with the story of some kind of wierd jet crash in the immediate area."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-76.413498","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"40.636231","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Tremont","Date Submitted":"09/01/2012 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09012012-0015","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 08:05 UTC","Case Number":"42196","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42196.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42196.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Tremont","There were no other sightings in Tremont on or around September 1st 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.636231,+-76.413498(42196)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42196) map </A>","Summary":"bright fireball but not quite fireball moving in sky."}
