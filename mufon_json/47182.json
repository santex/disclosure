My friend and I were camping out in my parent's back yard, about 2 miles north of Richmond, Indiana. It was around midnight. We were lying on our sleeping bags looking up at the stars when a large, black, wing shaped object flew overhead going from east to west. There were no lights and there was no sound, other than we could hear the air rushing over the object as it moved. It flew in a straight line and then it was gone. Total observation time was maybe 15 seconds max. It seemed to be shaped sort of like a stealth bomber, but of course this was decades before the stealth bomber was first flown. It was amazing that something could move so quickly with no sound at all and no lights of any type. We never heard anything in the news about it and we didn't report it until now. Was afraid of being ridiculed. Now, I don't care if someone wants to ridicule me!"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Richmond","There were no other sightings in Richmond on or around June 15th 1966"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.854489,+-84.870081(47182)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47182) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/15/1966 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47182.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47182.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.870081","Case Number":"47182","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Region":"Indiana","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-05052013-0010","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.854489"}
