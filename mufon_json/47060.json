The streak seemed to be at least 10 miles away. There was no sound associated with the light. I was able to get my phone out and take a picture of the streak across the sky. It was visible for about 15 seconds. The streak disappeared immediately, there was no fading of the streak. Included with this report are two photos. The first is the original, showing the streak, and two stars, Pollux and Castor, in the western sky. The second photo is the same photo with the stars identified and circled with Paint Shop Pro. No other alterations were made to either photo. The location of the prominent stars and the time of evening will accurately show the location of the light streak."],"Longitude":"-100.798816","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Perryton","Latitude":"36.395291","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"47060","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Perryton","There were no other sightings in Perryton on or around April 28th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"04/28/2013 11:42 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-04282013-0030","Date of the Event":"04/28/2013 09:30 UTC"}
