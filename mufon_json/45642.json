Heading south on Byhalia Rd. in Collierville, TN; just south of Poplar but north of Winchester. At the train tracks, I noticed four bright lights in a trapezoid like formation. I initially thought these were planes on their way in to land. Within seconds of noticing the lights, I realized that they were quite close and rather low for any incoming aircraft. In unison, the light banked to the south and seemed to level off and head in that direction. I stopped in a parking lot to witness the event until it seemed to glide off, out of view. The 2 friends following also stopped and witnessed the event, confirming to me that I \"wasnt just seeing things\". The entire sighting took place in approximately 2 minutes."]}
