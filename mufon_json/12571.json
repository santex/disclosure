{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI had knocked on the back door of a friends house and was waiting for him to answer. I looked to the sky and saw 6 round lights in a triangle formation. The lights traveled at a very high speed. I began banging on my friends again trying to get him come out to so this. Suddenly the leading light became very bright and disappeared. This occured with the next two lights and then the last three. My friend came out just in time to see the last three lights become brighter and then go out. The Air National Guard, stationed at Youngstown Airport, said the were weather balloons. I, at twelve years old, thought that the weather balloon explanation very weak and figured they really didnt know. I personally believe our planet is just another grain of sand in the universe and is just not possible that our planet is the only one supporting life in some form. Just like \"Battle Star Gallatica,\" there could very well be others having to leave ther dying planet and find a new home. This will happen to us some day. That is if we don't kill ourselves off first."],"Log Number":"US-09172008-0066","Latitude":"40.420957","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.420957,+-82.902753(12571)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12571) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/14/1955 09:15 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12571.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12571.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"6 round lights in a triangle","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"12571","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","trends":[],"Country":"United States","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"02/14/1955 09:15 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-82.902753","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
