{"divs":["sighting detailsi'm up in the northwest valley of phoenix so i never actually saw the ufo that was reported. but about 10-15 minutes before the reported event i watched 3 fighters about 30 seconds apart in the sky over luke air force base. they were all headed south in the casa grande \\ tuscon direction. it didn't appear to be a drill, all 3 had their afterburners firing (you could distinctly hear all 3 as they took off) until i lost sight of them. so they appeared to be headed somewhere in a hurry. given the direction they were headed and the number of jets described in the report i'm almost positive these are the 3 fighter planes that were seen chasing down the object in san manuel."],"trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Glendale","There were no other sightings in Glendale on or around November 5th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"11/05/2010 08:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.544962,+-112.178027(26409)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26409) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11072010-0004","Date Submitted":"11/07/2010 04:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-112.178027","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Region":"Arizona","Summary":"Confirmation of San Manuel, AZ report","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.544962","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"26409","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Glendale","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26409.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26409.html"]}
