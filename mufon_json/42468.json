There was a blinding bright light, so bright it made your eyes hurt to look and just like that, it was gone. I fist noticed the object when I was sitting outside, watching the stars as I often do. At first I thought the object was a shooting star, but it began to hover. it was also much brighter and much lower than the other stars. I was at first terribly afraid that they were coming for me again. I relaxed when I saw that the object had stopped and was not very close to me. After the bright light and the objects disappearance, I felt extremely uneasy. I hope no one was taken."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42468.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42468.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"42468","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Date Submitted":"09/11/2012 12:17 UTC","Log Number":"US-09112012-0002","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"The disc shaped object about the size of a basketball seemed to zoom cross the sky, and then hovered for approximately 6 minutes.The disc then appeared to descend while mkin a faint buzzing sound that I seemed to be able to feel more than hear.","Country":"United States","trends":[],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc","Latitude":"40.422607","Longitude":"-82.897593"}
