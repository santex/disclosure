{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was 11:25 I saw it. I was riding in the backseat of the car looking up at the stars. We were on route 9 in Johnsville of Bracken county Kentucky.I was looking north when I saw it. The best I can describe it, like a green comet but unlike any comet or meteor I've ever seen. It looked to me to be a bright green ball of light that had a halo of white light and two white trails coming off the back. It came from the north and seemed to be falling at an angle of 15 degrees then turned sharply downward. It disappeared behind the trees very quickly. I saw it only for a few seconds. But I think it may have been traveling southeast. If I had held up my thumb the object would have a little bigger. Many quarter size. After their object was gone a smoke trail was still visible for a long time. I felt happy and excited to see something so special. But the two others in the car said they felt unsettled."],"Case Number":"51137","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"bright green light","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Johnsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-09282013-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51137.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51137.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Johnsville","Longitude":"-84.148266","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Kentucky","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Date of the Event":"09/27/2013 11:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.753404,+-84.148266(51137)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51137) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/28/2013 02:21 UTC","Latitude":"38.753404","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Tags":"City"}
