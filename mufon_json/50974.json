Each set of orbs, one pair slightly following another, moved silently, and maintained a precise formation insomuch as keeping the distance between each individual orb and its respective partner. The second pair was in a formation that had one orb slightly southwest in relation to the other, while the first pair was oriented in an east to west fashion. I have video of this event."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/22/2013 01:58 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-09222013-0005","Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.037261,+-72.456866(50974)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50974) map </A>","Summary":"2 pairs of orbs slowly floated along a path from NW to NE","Case Number":"50974","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Longitude":"-72.456866","Date of the Event":"09/20/2013 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"41.037261","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Peconic","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","City":"Peconic","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
