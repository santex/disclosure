When I was done, I was noticing what a beautiful night it was and up above my vision I noticed something moving, thinking it might be little private plane, there was no sound. The lights were moving very slow as if one was pulling the other in a straight line. I watched for a few seconds and then ran in the house to get my camera. I wasn't out of sight for more than 10 sec. and when I got back outside, the lights were gone."],"Source":"MUFON"}
