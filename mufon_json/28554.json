Object was directly overhead moving from north to south in an erratic jumping zig-zag pattern. Appeared to have 5 lights. Starting on the left going to the right they were white, red, white, red, white. Due to the low luminosity of the lights when compared to an airliners lights it was either at very high altitude or dimly lit. The object moved from directly over me to disappear behind the mountain peaks in roughly 3-4 seconds. The jumping zig zag pattern made it hard to follow by eye. I could not discern any fuselage or wings nor was there any sound. The sky was clear and cloudless with stars being very pronounced. I am an ex Army air crew member and have several hours in the air. I am well aware of the performance restrictions of current aircraft and their lighting configurations. If it were not for the snapping zig zag pattern of the flight path as well as the speed I would have written it off as a high altitude flight probably military. For the same reasons I dismissed the Idea of a meteor."],"Latitude":"33.790498","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-04052011-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.790498,+-116.950735(28554)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28554) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Chevron"}
