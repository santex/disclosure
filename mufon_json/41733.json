{"Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"looked like star but moved, thought it might be a satalite, but was moving south, then shot off at great speed to the east","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-93.135806","Date of the Event":"08/13/2012 10:20 UTC","divs":["sighting detailswas outside in my driveway looking up to mostly clear sky. i had stepped out to have a cigarette. i thought i might catch a few meteors as we had a meteor shower last night, and i know there is a chance to see some tonight, not really scheduled until 3-5 am. we live near the st paul\\ minneapolis airport. there is also a private airport about 10 miles west of us. i was looking up and saw an airplane come over my house and watched it until it disappeared to the east in the only patch of clouds i could see from where i was standing. then i noticed a star that seemed to be drifting south. it was very steady in its course and i thought i might be seeing a satellite ( i have seen one before) but i thought it was too late to see that and also i thought to myself, they travel from east to west or vice versa. it had started nearly over my head and was about half way to the horizon when it suddenly shot to the east at that rate of speed you always hear ufos do (amazingly fast). and it disappeared from my view. the whole sighting lasted about one minute. after it disappeared i went inside to tell my mother, then i checked the time (10:20pm) and looked up mufon to make a report. there is obviously no evidence, not even film, but i thought i'd like to know if anyone else saw this, just to kind of back each other up. and i know it wasn't a meteor but perhaps there is another explanation that i am unaware of that someone could let me know. so really just for austerity and corroberation do i make the report. thank you."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Farmington","There were no other sightings in Farmington on or around August 13th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.647275,+-93.135806(41733)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41733) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41733.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41733.html"],"City":"Farmington","Latitude":"44.647275","Case Number":"41733","Log Number":"US-08132012-0041","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 11:50 UTC"}
