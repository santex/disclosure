I looked up and seen there were two large balls of light (one larger than the other) and a small red light and within a few seconds flashed and dissapeared. I took my dog outside and further investigated noticing that in the same spot above the tree line there was a dim yellow light that might resemble mars in the night sky as if something had burned out in the sky. Shortly after this vanished as well. About an hour after that I noticed these exact same lights in the same location for a split second and they vanished again. I live not more than 30 minutes from Dover AFB in Dover, DE. Im not sure what to make of it...all I know is that i have never seen anything like that before."],"Summary":"2 Large white balls of light, one small red light","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Barclay","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-01142010-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21495.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21495.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"01/14/2010 07:35 UTC"}
