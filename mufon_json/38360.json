It was a clear nigt not a cloud insight. At the time I was with my cousin, we observed the object from a balcony. It felt like a few minutes but we lost over an hour. She refuses to date to speak of this event . I also witnessed same object=when I lived closer to the Hudson River at 159 Hawthrone Ave, Top floor Apt. 9A (? I am not sure if A or D) from the ages of 7 until we moved to MA when I was 12. I went every summer to visit my cousin's who lived on Jody Lane. What bother's me the most about the time at my cousins is the time. Lapse, what felt like a few mi utes was at least over an hour. The object was not a plane, planes do not move that fast in & then stop & hover. Also the lights spun then changed pateern I have never reported these happenings for fear of sounding crazy!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.718873","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Longitude":"-74.000723","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 3 other sightings in New York on or around July 11th 1983"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/22/2012 12:09 UTC","City":"New York","Case Number":"38360","Summary":"Dark object hovering over Hudson river, lights spun, also random lighting different colors.
