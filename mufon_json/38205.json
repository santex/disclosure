Noticed 3 bright unusual lights over Tampa Bay that hadn't been there earlier in night or on other nights. My wife and I saw them while outside hotel so I went to room and filmed them from the balcony. Have no idea what they were. There is an airport nearby I believe but these lights stayed pretty much in one area above the bay most of the time (at least 30 minutes). I dont know if they could have been helicopters searching the bay but they didn't seem like that to us. I have attached a picture that came from the video I took. It is of one of the objects when it is orange. I have about 10 minutes of HD video of them, although it gets pretty shaky at times."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05172012-0014","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38205.html"]}
