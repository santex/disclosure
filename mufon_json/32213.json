{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Boomerang","divs":["Sighting DetailsAbout a half hour after noon, my coworkers and I obeserved an unknown object in the great Clear Lake area of Houston, TX. close to the NASA complex. Observed a white boomerang like object tumble through the sky in a horizontal line, descending slightly as it moved across the sky. It seemed to get smaller as we observed it. We looked away, for no more than five to ten seconds, looked back and it was gone. It was moving east to west at approx. 45 degrees above the horizon."],"Summary":"Boomerang shape that tumbled through the sky","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There was one other sighting in Houston on or around September 30th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32213.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Houston","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.10484","Object Features":"None","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Case Number":"32213","Log Number":"US-09302011-0015","Date Submitted":"09/30/2011 02:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.546123,+-95.10484(32213)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32213) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/30/2011 12:47 UTC","Latitude":"29.546123"}
