I'm an ex- airline pilot with many, many years being around flying objects. Nothing can fly at right angles the way it did. I wasn't drinking, and could not believe what I saw. It only last about 20 seconds and it was over. I go out every night and look in this direction hoping to see it again. And in that direction is a major power plant about 5 miles from where I live. I'm just guessing it may have had something to do with it being in that area.
