I stopped to ���porch��� one of my customers papers and looked up to the sky when I got out of my car. I saw what looked like a star moving right to left. I say it looked like a star, but it was a little brighter and a more defined circular shape than the stars around it. I immediately got the sense that this was something out of the ordinary, it obviously wasn't a star because it moved, and it wasn't a plane. I am certain it wasn���t a plane as I see them in the night sky often and they usually have blinking red & white lights, and move in a smooth, linear motion at a constant rate of speed. The object I saw was a solid white light that did not blink, it moved faster than what a plane would and it���s movements were not smooth, but more erratic. It moved up, than down, then in a more or less straight line, then it made like a half circle and began to dim, as though it were moving away from me, and just disappeared. My initial reaction was disbelief. I am interested in the paranormal and UFO's and have always hoped I would be witness to something like this, so I didn't want my desire to color what could be a sighting of an ordinary object. However, after just a second or two, I felt certain, I knew, that what I was seeing wasn't ordinary. I stood quite still and watched the object until, as I said, it faded and disappeared. I could hear my car radio behind me and there was no static or interference. Neither was there any interference with the car engine. I heard no sounds from the object."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Log Number":"US-03082011-0003","Country":"United States","Case Number":"28156","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Longitude":"-75.968245","Date Submitted":"03/08/2011 06:04 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Virginia Beach","There were no other sightings in Virginia Beach on or around March 8th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28156.html"],"Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"36.860796","City":"Virginia Beach","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I witnessed a bright, white light moving across the night sky.","Object Features":"None"}
