In this case the light didn���t go out right away. As soon as the sky lit up, I slammed on my brakes and slowed to about 20 mph and looked through my windshield. To the right and about 50��� off the road and 30��� to 40��� up, there was a large fireball about the size of a U-Haul van traveling horizontal and at the same speed as me. This lasted about 10 seconds (10 seconds doesn���t sound long but seemed like 10 minutes) . All the while reducing in size until���POOF!!! It was gone. You would think it was a meteor gravity would bring it down, but this wasn���t the case. It stayed in a straight path until it reduced to nothing. Well that���s my story, the only reason I told it was because someone else reported a fireball in PA."],"Case Number":"14343","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball"}
