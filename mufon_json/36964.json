{"Case Number":"36964","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy name is Harold Melton. I am 66 years old living in Jacksonville, NC Approximately five years ago it was noticed that I have a very small piece of (metal) embedded in my left hip. It is small and square in shape showing brightly on an X-Ray. This discovery was the result of an X-Ray at a Chiropractor's office. I asked what it might be and the Doctor had no idea but supposed I had been hit with Shrapnel while in combat. No, I served but was never in combat. Just last year I had another X-Ray and the object is still visible. Are there individuals out there still interested in this? Thanks.
