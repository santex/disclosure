There were spots of showers coming down in the distance and bolts of lightening and then to the East it was clear blue sky. I was on my patio in my back yard under the patio roof. I took 10 -15 pictures in about 15 - 20 minutes. I was trying to catch a picture of the lightening so I was trying different settings on my camera. When I started to rain I went in, and did not look at he pictures until the next day. That was when I noticed the one picture with the space ship looking disc in the sky. 2 of them where identical and the third was like it was behind a cloud and was not as distinct and the other 2. I thought how did I not see them when I took the picture yet they are plain as night and day in the picture. Everyone I have showed the picture to believes the same thing, that they were space ships from another planet. My theory is they were not visible to the naked eye and for some reason were picked up by the camera lens. I am going to send you some of the other pictures I took too so you can see how amazing the sky looked that evening."],"City":"Lincoln","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Lincoln","There were no other sightings in Lincoln on or around September 10th 2013","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/13/2013 04:13 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.815938","Log Number":"US-09132013-0014","Date of the Event":"09/10/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-96.584822","Region":"Nebraska","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50802.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file1__UFOs9.10.2013.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file2__524526102011773938503221847278332n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file3__557512102011773992504571396958238n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file4__117514410201177401250507833700983n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file5__118697410201177389210206455337644n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file6__1234048102011773931303041742556674n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file7__123423610201177402010526588106362n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file8__1236541102011773892502072030362686n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50802_submitter_file9__1236922102011774027305441960479867n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50802.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"50802"}
