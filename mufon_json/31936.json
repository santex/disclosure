{"City":"Milwaukee","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle, Other","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was in west allis wi spring time 2007 with my 2 friends walking around at night it must have been 9pm we were near 68th and Greenfield and we all heard a loud jet engine roar as we look up we see two crafts At a height you normally don���t see crafts flying at we notice the two jets were traveling at a high speed The gap between them was no more then 12 yards they were triangle in shape a white light at the front tip one white light at each wing tip and in the center of the craft on the top side right where a cockpit would be was a red light all these lights were about the size of a golf ball just basically indicator lights . The crafts seemed it wasn���t solid it seemed to be transparent like see through and these jets were roaring the sound was why we all looked up in the first place well it must of took us 30-40 minutes to get to r friends house and through out the night we would look up too keep a eye on these supersonic jets and i swear to you at on point it was on the east side of the city then the north,west, and south it was miles away from us in the sky but it circled the whole city there's just nothing I know of that can circle around the city that fast it wasent natural we got to the house and just couldn���t stop talking about it . well fast forward to 10pm n here���s where the real juicy event happens me and my two friends walk up to the bus stop on 66th Lincoln my one friend lives down the street so he literally ran home my other friend stays with me about 15 minuets go by an across the street from us is a 3-4 story tall building an I just happened to be looking at the roof and right over the top of this building I see this black triangular shape craft about the size of a fighter jet with the exact same lights as the crafts I saw prior only this time it was one of them and it wasent translucent it was black it hovered a few feet over the building top and then it continued to travle right above me at the same height as the roof top but right before it came over me the craft tilted its body on a side way lean and as soon as it came over me and my buddy on the bottom of each wingtip two soft ball sized perfect circles just lit up white for about 2 seconds and then the 4 soft ball sized lights turned off the craft leveled again(it came off its lean to straighten out) and it hoverd right over us down the block and we lost sight of it due to trees and houses and i noticed something up close about the craft i didnt from earily when it was high in the air at high speeds well when it hoverd over us i noticed yes it was triangular in shape but at the rear it had a stingray shaped tail about2-3 yards long and while the whole time it was floaitng over us not one bit of sound was emitted from this craft while earlier at those high speeds those things were roaring I mean when this thing was right over head of me if I had a rock I could of hit it i got on the bus ran home googled all the facts on what i saw mach 7 travle triangular shape and one thing poped up the aurora top secrect doesnt exsist air craft the only thing that dint match was the sting ray tail everything elese was righ on so i belive i saw a miltary aircraft not a ufo in short i saw with my freinds two jets travel aound the city at mach 7 the n latter that night only one of those jets haoverd over me silently took a photo or beamed four lights one me and then it contiued over my head down the block"],"Viewing Distance":"N/A","Latitude":"43.086275","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.086275,+-87.994697(31936)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31936) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/19/2011 07:36 UTC","Log Number":"US-09192011-0035","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.994697","Summary":"2 tringle crafts circle city at high speed then later theat night one hovers over me","Date of the Event":"02/19/2007 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Wings, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31936.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31936.html"],"Object Flight Path":"N/A","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Milwaukee","There were no other sightings in Milwaukee on or around February 19th 2007"],"Case Number":"31936","Region":"Wisconsin","Sighting Duration":"00:00:22"}
