I have lived here for 14 years and have never seen a light like this before. It looked like a star but there was something that was not right. It was a very orange color and was pulsating. I went inside and got my binoculars. I observed the light for about 3 minutes as it was stationary. Then as I was watching it started moving and made an arc in the sky. I watched it as is moved over the course of about 2 minutes before it was out of view. there was no apparent sound. It had the appearance of boiling fire like high resolution images of the sun."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48140.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48140.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Case Number":"48140","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Harpers Ferry","Longitude":"-77.798882","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
