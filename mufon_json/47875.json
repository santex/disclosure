After dinner we decided to go out together for the first time to try to catch spirits on film and also to walk down this spooky trail we saw the first time visiting the graveyard. so here we are, the second time visiting the graveyard. we have the film footage from the entrance in the graveyard to the exit out. what made me notice these weird happenings was when I analyzed the footage looking for ghost that we hopefully caught on film. I did not see any ghosts but boy do we get a lot more! first we catch a voice come in when we were laying down in front of camera starting to make love. all you see is our feet because I forgot to push the record button off. then on the way around the outskirts of the graveyard I witnessed on film an object fly from miles away from us going thousands mile per hour come up to car at an instant halt, hover left to right before zipping off to the right but not near as fast as it came up on us."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","Summary":"wierd ufo came up on us in a site where we were ghosthunting. caught it on film. coolest thing i ever experienced and i have a son that was born","Log Number":"US-06042013-0030","Case Number":"47875","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47875.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47875.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.154484","trends":[],"Region":"South Carolina","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering,Other","Object Shape":"Oval, Other","Date of the Event":"05/29/2013 08:24 UTC"}
