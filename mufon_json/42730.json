When it started moving is when I noticed it. I wasn't sure, it was something I've never seen before. It moved fast and I tried to keep up with it. I was fast, bright enough for me to see that it was different than anything I've ever seen before. It went back and forth above me, about high or level of trees. It didn't look like ufo, more like a bright orbish thing. I lost sight when it vanished almost like disappeared. Strangest thing i've ever witnessed."],"Tags":"City"}
