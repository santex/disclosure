I was approximately at mile marker 60 on I-35 (about 20 miles north of Ardmore, OK) I noticed a bright light in the sky and leaned forward to get a better view. I thought at first it was a plane but whatever the object was it was was producing more light than I have seen a plane ever make. It also was not flashing or pulsating light either just shining. I could make out something was inside the light but could not make out a shape. It did look like one end looked like the end of a thin cigar (thinning out towards a tip). After leaning forward I noticed hover for a second longer then it all of a sudden flashed and disappeared completely. The flash was a decent amount brighter than it had been just before. I kept looking after and could not see anything else in the sky. There were no visible stars yet. It was too high to be the top of a tower or any other ground anchored light."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Ardmore","There were no other sightings in Ardmore on or around November 24th 2009"],"City":"Ardmore","Region":"Oklahoma","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11242009-0011","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-97.133925","Summary":"A bright light with some sort of object and gone with a flash.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/24/2009 09:53 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/24/2009 06:00 UTC","Case Number":"20701","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20701.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20701.html"]}
