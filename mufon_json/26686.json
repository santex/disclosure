It wasn't very high in the sky . Was lower then the cloud cover. I thought I was crazy at first , had one passenger with me got his attention he couldn't idetify at either. As we continued driving to our office we could see it slowly climb higher into the sky. We watched it for a few more minutes until it dissappered over the horizon to the west. My best description would be that it looked like a comet flying horizontally."],"Case Number":"26686","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Pascagoula","Latitude":"30.371915","Summary":"Large glowing orange teardrop was also described as looking like an orange sperm,","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.371915,+-88.550227(26686)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26686) map </A>","Longitude":"-88.550227"}
