I come home and watch activity up in the sky at night and see with binoculars.The craft is shaped like an oval giving off a pulsating whitish lime color and traveling at a high rate of speed. I have been in the aerospace business for 18 years and never seen anything like this. I tracked the ufo over our neighborhood and I lost it when it sped off. The ufo lights like to blend its self at night with the stars so it cant be dectected when it is hovering. About an half hour later I was relooking up in the sky I saw the object fixed in position and it didnt move. I looked up and it seemed it was observing me. Then it took off at a highrate of speed over Lake Erie. Last week I saw 2 ufos traveling together back to the lake. I know one thing in the aerospace business all commercial craft have to keep all 3 lights on but this craft is just one solid color."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.653936,+-81.450392(11140)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11140) map </A>","Region":"Ohio","Date of the Event":"06/11/2008 01:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"11140","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.653936","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Ufo traveling from north to south over Lake Erie I","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","Date Submitted":"06/11/2008 01:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Eastlake","There were no other sightings in Eastlake on or around June 11th 2008"],"Longitude":"-81.450392","Tags":"City"}
