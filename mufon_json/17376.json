{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was traveling west bound on us.route 6 into channahon. as i was approaching us 55 i noticed a bright light in the sky that was hanging low to the ground. it was lightning out so i couldn't tell what it was at first. as i got closer to highway 55 i noticed it dropped a bit but was hovering over us route 6. i stopped my car on route 6 and turned off my radio. no sounds were coming from the craft. it hovered there for about 8 or 9 seconds and then traveled south east on route 6. the craft had 3 small round white lights in back. on one side of the craft it had a blue blinking light, on the other side it had a red solidly lit light. it seems to be long skinny triangle with wings. it was silent. if it was a jet or a helicopter i would have been able to hear the sounds but this was silent. i freaked out and noticed a car vastly approaching behind me so i turned off onto the southbound frontage road and watch it slowly move south east and then vanish."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.221644","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17376.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.435195,+-88.221644(17376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17376) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/08/2009 01:09 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/08/2009 01:09 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","Latitude":"41.435195","Country":"United States","City":"Channahon","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"17376","Summary":"3 white lights with blue blinking light and a solid red light.","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-06082009-0002","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Channahon","There were no other sightings in Channahon on or around June 8th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois"}
