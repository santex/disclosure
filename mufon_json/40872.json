{"Object Shape":"Oval","Region":"Oklahoma","Summary":"Glowing Green Object going S to N over treetops","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the night of June 5, 2012 sometime after 10 PM, I was standing in my son's frontyard, facing the West when something caught my eye, I looked up and over the tree tops I saw a glowing green object going from left to right (S to N). It was maybe half a mile away, really hard to say the distance. It lasted just a few seconds. My son (age 31) looked up and saw it as it went behind the trees. It wasn't falling from the sky or being shot up, just going straight. I've been looking online since that night to see if anyone reported seeing something like this. Someone finally directed me to this website. Does anyone have any idea what it was? This is the first time I've seen anything like this and now I find myself looking up at the sky every time I go outside."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"40872","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.486043,+-97.654279(40872)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40872) map </A>","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40872.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40872.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-97.654279","trends":["There have been 78 other sightings in Oklahoma City","There was one other sighting in Oklahoma City on or around June 5th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Oklahoma City","Log Number":"US-07172012-0004","Date of the Event":"06/05/2012 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/17/2012 01:47 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.486043","Source":"MUFON"}
