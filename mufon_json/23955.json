We were watching the sunset. While my cousin was talking I noticed what I assumed to be a plane because it was silver and long (cigar shaped). It moved left, stopped then turned around going right. It lit up with a white light for about a minute. It went dim and bright and then by the time I really realized it was a UFO and told my cousin to look it vanished. We stayed there for awhile and I saw a \"plane\" move NW. It stopped in flight and disappeared. My cousin barely missed it again. Then after it got dark and a lengthy deep conversation, we got up and got ready to leave. While I was telling a story, my cousin said he saw what appeared to be an object fly through the trees just beyond the field we were at. He said it looked like it found a clearing, flew through it and took off. There were red and white lights that seemed to be spinning. We got out of there pretty quick. This was the 2nd time I have seen one in this area and it was with the same person."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.101326,+-94.576667(23955)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23955) map </A>","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There was one other sighting in Kansas City on or around June 25th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"06/25/2010 08:30 UTC"}
