I watched it and thought it was an airplane when it moved across in front of me. The object was probably 5 to 6 thousand feet up and moving at what I thought was an average speed, nothing really attention getting. All of a sudden a yellow portal opened up in front of it and it went through and it closed behind it. I have thought about this for 3 years and wonder if anyone else has ever seen anything like this. I am not crazy!!!!"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sparks","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/10/2009 01:00 UTC"}
