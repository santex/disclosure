The object got brighter. Then moved straight up and hovered awhile and then moved very fast to the Southeast and finally disappeared. The object made no noise and was not an airplane and or a helicopter. Myself and two freinds viewed it and other three people saw it and we all were saying Wow, how strange, it's definitely a UFO.
