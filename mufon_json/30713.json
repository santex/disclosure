I was about 6 or 7. I lived in the city of Erie, PA. It was in a residential neighborhood in the middle of the city. Multiple people in my neighborhood saw it. I dont remember waking up to come out on the porch to see it, I also dont remember going to sleep afterwards. It was huge in size. Approx. 300 yards long and 100 yards high. With multiple lights seemingly scattered randomly across the craft. I beleive it hovered for 10 minutes or so about 100 ft off the ground. It was totally silent. My mother also witnessed it. I'm pretty sure our paper ran a story on it a few days after."],"City":"Erie","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"05/31/1988 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-80.047778","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
