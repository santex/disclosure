I have been seeing it for over 28 years. It seems to bee around the same area each time I have seen it. It seems to change its color to match the background and move very fast in any direction it wants to go. I have seen Black Hawk choppers around almost every time. STRANGE. It just seems to be checking things out but what I have no idea? I have been in this beautiful area for over 40 years and have seen a lot of strange things and Black Hawk Choppers are always around when I have the sightings."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.65619,+-106.942031(51237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51237) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"51237","Longitude":"-106.942031","Tags":"City"}
