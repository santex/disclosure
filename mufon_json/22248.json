Sometimes we would see air traffic for the airport or very rarely a police helicopter, now growing up around Air Force and other bases I know what lights on aircraft look like, close up or at a distance, we're in a 2 story house up stairs master room facing full south while watching T.V. on this night my Wife & I were shocked when our entire room lit up as if someone had parked right outside our window with headlights and fog lights on high, I mean the room was straight lit up now we've caught the police chopper with it's light headed toward us but this wasn't the case on this night. Once we realized it wasn't normal I had gotten up to try and get a photo turned my back for 1 second and it flickered off the same way if flickered on it might not have been a UFO but it wasn't normal at all."]}
