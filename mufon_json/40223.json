Both times on July 4th around 11:30pm. Last year we noticed three orbs moving in a triangle shape across the sky in a south to north direction. Moving in formation. This year, we saw two lights again moving from the south to the north. However, they were in a straight line. They do not float on the wind. They have accurate direction - they move in a formation. They admit no sound and no white stream of smoke. They move over our home without distrubing anything. Very interesting and exciting to see. Got video again this year...can't focus in on them...they become blurry."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Choctaw","There were no other sightings in Choctaw on or around July 4th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Orange orbs moving slowly from the south to the north...no sound.","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.235731","Region":"Oklahoma","City":"Choctaw","Case Number":"40223","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 12:42 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40223.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40223.html"]}
