When suddenly, I saw one large orange colored round craft appear to the west of me, and then a smaller orange colored round craft appeared east of the larger craft. Then suddenly, the smaller craft merged with the larger craft and left an orange comet trail when it entered the other craft. When I first saw this happening, I knew it was U.F.O., and not flares, or any type of aircraft. I also looked to see if there were any aircraft around the crafts and there wasn't. I was stunned, because it happened so quickly."],"City":"De Leon","Latitude":"32.118594","Longitude":"-98.526932","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"01/01/2008 08:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-01302008-0015","Summary":"Two huge orange glowing objects, round in shape.
