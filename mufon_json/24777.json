I observed no navigation lights. I ran to my back door and grabbed my Binoculars for a closer look. By the time I returned I watched them dim very rapidly so that I COULD NOT SEEM THEM THROUGH MY 10X50 Binoculars. I watched for a possible re-sighting for about 50 minutes and came in to write this report. The objects were almost vertically overhead and had a luminosity about twice that of Venus. They trailed one behind the other. There were no nav lights or jet noise to be heard. I live near an airport so I am familiar with aircraft distinctions. wish there was more to tell but thats it.I was quite calm during the event as I had a feeling this was not ordinary aircraft I am accustomed to seeing in this area."],"Country":"United States","City":"Providence","Log Number":"US-07272010-0001","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Providence","There were no other sightings in Providence on or around July 26th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24777.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24777.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"07/26/2010 10:45 UTC","Region":"Rhode Island","Summary":"Two objects of short duration.","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-71.406414","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"24777","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.826729","Object Features":"Unknown"}
