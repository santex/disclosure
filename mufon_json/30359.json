yes, he saw that too. my two daughters had similar experience. the 9-year-old saw it as a whitish-yellowish rectangular-type object, or rather two ends to the object, with a space in the center. one object held together by something in the center. my 16-year-old saw a rectangular object, two objects flying front to back, with a space in the center where the wings would be if it were an aircraft (only she didn't see wings), and she said both sections were lit up like incandenscent lights (yellowish). my 7-year-old son and i both saw this cross-type object, rectangular, with the two pieces, but we could see faint \"wings\" on it, like a bi-wing plane. it would be a safe guess to say the object was segmented. others who came out of the building at the same time were also looking at this object as it moved. i made my kids get back out of the car to witness this object. at that point, a very large commercial-type jet (i'm conjecturing here since i'm not an expert in aircraft) appeared just to our southeast. the object continued to sail along in the sky and this jet seemed to bank away from it, to the southeast, like they were pretty close together in the sky. the object appeared to be above the jet but it seemed very close, like the jet was avoiding the larger, slender object. another mother said, \"that's too close for my comfort,\" or something to that effect. that's when i realized there were others watching the object. the jet appeared as if out of nowhere and i was surprised it was so close to the ground, much closer than they usually get. but we have a fly-in locally this week so there may be a good explanation for why it was so close. we continued watching the long object as it continued east, heading a bit southeast as it went. the jet had suddenly appeared and afterwards, nobody remembers seeing the jet leave the area, just that it appeared almost overhead, making noise, and then it was gone. my 9-year-old daughter said she heard the original object making a humming noise but i don't have the best hearing so i can't discount that. it was pretty high up there. we lost sight of the object about 8:13 pm cdt as it continued its steady path east-southeast. there appeared to be a small contrail in the area where we last saw the object. i was initially not surprised to see an odd object in the sky due to the eaa (experimental aircraft association) fly-in at oshkosh this week, approximately 25 miles northeast from our location. i thought it was a glider but realized it was too high up to be a glider. then i thought it could be a satellite, but it was close enough to see: every satellite i've ever seen has been a bright dot in the sky at night but not during the day or even the brighter evening light. the cross-shape was interesting but the cross-wings were pretty hard to see and they didn't seem to be there the entire time, if that makes sense. it definitely was no plane. and the jet that showed up all of a sudden and then nobody remembered watching it fly away is troubling too. the long, slender object was not heading in the direction of the fly-in. this is a true and accurate account that my 3 children and i saw this evening. in addition, at least three others in the parking lot with us witnessed this object."],"Log Number":"US-07262011-0015","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Wings, Other","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cross, Square, Rectagular","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"30359","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30359.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30359.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.640022,+-88.726692(30359)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30359) map </A>","City":"Waupun","Tags":"City"}
