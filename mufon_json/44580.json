We were all very confused and some were even frightened. One of my friends even mentioned it could be a chinese lantern but this couldn't be so as it was moving very very quickly and side to side. I was very scared at first but then eager for an alien invasion. I spoke with a co-worker today about it and he said he saw it last night too as well as 2 weeks ago."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.224429","Date Submitted":"12/15/2012 06:49 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"25.793209","Log Number":"US-12152012-0015","Tags":"City","City":"Miami"}
