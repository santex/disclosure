It was fascinating and may not be UFO related but wanted to report it just in case. We have not stopped talking about it, I even called my dad to tell him. I look forward to seeing if anyone else brings it up."],"Summary":"saw what looked like a meteor falling and then saw the lights","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around September 5th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.446516,+-84.353033(19093)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19093) map </A>","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Oval, Unknown","Case Number":"19093","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/05/2009 11:14 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09052009-0018","Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"39.446516","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19093.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19093.html"]}
