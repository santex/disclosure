It was 4:36PM, EDT, a very bright afternoon with a bright sun directly above the light. My initial thought was sun reflecting off of a plane. The light grew brighter, then back to original brightness twice over a period of about 15 - 20 seconds. Then it quickly disappeared. I waited a few minutes, expecting to see either more light or a plane appear, but it did not. I'm very skepitcal about UFO sightings, but this just seemed odd to me. By the way, Harrisburg airport is nearby."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Harrisburg","There were no other sightings in Harrisburg on or around April 4th 2012"],"Longitude":"-76.788809","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37128.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37128.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/04/2012 05:19 UTC","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/04/2012 04:36 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.218702,+-76.788809(37128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37128) map </A>","Case Number":"37128"}
