{"divs":["sighting detailswitnessed twice in past week,1st sighting was from 1 am to 3 am on 2\\16\\2013 from bedroom window after seeing what i thought was a star move,then both my wife and i viewed it moving slowly,pulsating,stopping,changing directions,short bursts of speed,bouncing up and down like on an elastic string with 4 color lights rotating around the center. it was in area for approximately 2 to 2-1\\2 hours,witnessed it turn lights off when an airplane came into general area,we viewed the object through binoculars,also called 911 to report incident,coyotes in area were howling funny,dogs barking as well. from our bed last night on 2\\20\\2013 my wife spotted object in the same direction (southwest) from house,it would move away then come back closer until eventually moving out of binocular range to the northwest. awoke 13 year old son to view it as well on the 20th sighting,watched object from 1:39 am for approximately an hour on the 20th,we could see the object very distinctly through binoculars and no known aircraft can move like this object did,a helicopter would have made noise and there was no noise,although we did hear a strange hum and whoosh over our house while viewing this object and speculate there could have been a 2nd object closer to our house,but not in our sight.we have a telescope ,but had trouble picking up the object in the telescope.at times it was close enough to see outline and colored lights with naked eye. there is no doubt it was a ufo and not a mis-identification of any known aircraft,satellite,or planet\\star.none of the previous mentioned items can move like this object did in varying directions,stopping starting,lights on and off,etc important to note my camcorder was broken at time or i would have filmed object,i have a cheap digital camera,but the zoom is not enough to take a clear picture where object would have been identified,by the time i thought of the camera it was out of camera range,distance was estimated from 1\\4 mile to several miles away at various times.i have no evidence of this,but get the distinct feeling it will be back in this area again,motive is unknown as we are in a rural area,no military bases nearby,only a small airport 12 miles nortwest from here with little or no nighttime traffic from small county airport.cvg airport is 50 miles northwest of here and lex is over 45 miles southwest of here.only cattle and tobacco farms in this area."],"Case Number":"45815","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Summary":"1/2 sphere shaped bottom with saturn like circle around middle and smaller 1/2 sphere on top with rotatingblue,red,green,and yellow lights","Longitude":"-84.322574","Date Submitted":"02/21/2013 08:29 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome, Other","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45815.html"],"Region":"Kentucky","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Falmouth","There were no other sightings in Falmouth on or around February 20th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-02212013-0003","Latitude":"38.682427","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/20/2013 01:39 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.682427,+-84.322574(45815)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45815) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Falmouth","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Disc, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like, Other"}
