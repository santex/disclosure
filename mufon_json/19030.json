I saw a bright star-like object that seemed to move from left to right in a rapid motion. The star-like object was over Richland, WA. The object began to move foreward towards Pasco, WA in the direction of my house in a very swift and fast movement. As the object got closer to flying over my house I could not hear any engines or helicopter blades coming from the oject. The object then flew over my house at an altitude of approx. 29,000 ft. I lost sight of the object as it flew into the horizon. The object had not strobing or flashing lights like a plane or helicopter would. It did not make any noise."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09022009-0001","City":"Pasco","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Pasco","There were no other sightings in Pasco on or around September 1st 2009"],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2009 12:06 UTC","Latitude":"46.243979","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-119.098996","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.243979,+-119.098996(19030)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19030) map </A>","Tags":"City"}
