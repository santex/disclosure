Two to three objects showed up, but the bell craft on the bottom was the clearest photo I got. These objects were just over the rooftops of the houses here. I don't know how long it stayed in the area, but they keep showing up night after night. Very interesting, exciting. It is very hard to see these objects sometimes, but when they reflect light they can be seen. They are easily confused with conventional aircraft from a distance, but taking photos helps to know for sure. Their lights are brighter than conventional aircraft."],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Arizona"}
