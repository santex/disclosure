I got up and walked outside but didn't have to search the sky to find it as it was directly out my back door (East) traveling from South to North. At first it sort of looked like it might have been a plane, but it was lower than a plane, and in a place in the sky where I haven't seen planes before. One large white light seemed to wrap around the object and blink on and off. A small red light blinked at a faster speed than the white light(it looked like a small red light you'd find on a plane). What quickly made me reject the plane idea was the way it switched directions and turned around unlike a plane would. Almost as if it switched to reverse. I lost it behind the trees in my backyard. I was on the phone with my brother while observing this and the phone received interference and the call was dropped."],"Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-118.009759","Case Number":"30620","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO with strange lighting moved in sky unlike plane","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
