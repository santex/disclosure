My wife and I saw approximately.15 glowing orange spheres moving across the sky from west to east. they were silent and the group was followed by two more spheres identical to those in the group. the grouping seemed random and not an organized formation. the drivers around us were all looking up at the phenomena and some had rolled down their windows and had their heads outside to get a better look.
