At the time I was playing a video game and talking with my little sister and girlfriend. I heard a voice in my head telling me to turn around and look out the patio door of our apartment building. I turned and saw a very bright light that at first looked like a star. The object was moving slowly in my direction which made me believe it was a plane or helicopter. As it got closer I realized that it couldn't of been anything of that sort, since it was in fact noiseless. As it moved closer and closer it actually disappeared."],"Region":"Minnesota","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"I had spotted a large bright light in the sky coming towards me moving eastbound.","Case Number":"13494","Latitude":"45.103702","City":"Brooklyn Park","Weather Factors":"Windy","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13494.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13494.html"],"Disposition":"IFO"}
