I had just watched a commercial air-line heading west. As I looked back (couple moments later), about 30 degree off the north-west horizon traveling south-east...and object, the size of the largest star (white in color, not flashing, height unknown, (too much early commute traffic to hear any sound)...as high as the stars, and directly over head? I watch this object from 5:37am until it was out of my sight (my roof) ... guesstimating it would have taking 4-5 minutes from horizon to horizon. Ive never seen a commercial air-lines flying in this flight pattern...it was not flashing, a solid white light."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-114.659273","City":"Yuma","Latitude":"32.700325","Case Number":"51261","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"10/02/2013 05:37 UTC","Log Number":"US-10022013-0006","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/02/2013 09:28 UTC","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Yuma","There were no other sightings in Yuma on or around October 2nd 2013"],"Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.700325,+-114.659273(51261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51261) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Star-like light (object) abserved north-west traveling stright-line south-east"}
