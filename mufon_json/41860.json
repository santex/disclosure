{"Latitude":"40.893281","divs":["Sighting DetailsI observed two reddish lights about 15 degrees above the horizon initially from the living room of my house at around 10:15 PM EST on August 18th, 2012. It was a clear night with no clouds and good visibility. I went outside to get a better look and noticed that the lights were fairly bright, about the size of a penny from my observation point and were not producing any sound. The lights were orb-like in shape and were on a straight path from NE to SW although they moved up and down during flight. The reddish orbs flew over my house at an altitude of 200 to 500 feet. The orbs moved faster than balloon speed and I noticed that it was not windy. The orbs disappeared over the tree line in the SW."],"Longitude":"-81.530954","Date of the Event":"08/18/2012 10:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Observed two reddish orbs traveling from NE to SW","Region":"Ohio","City":"Canal Fulton","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Canal Fulton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.893281,+-81.530954(41860)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41860) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41860.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41860.html"],"Log Number":"US-08192012-0008","Case Number":"41860","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"08/19/2012 09:41 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
