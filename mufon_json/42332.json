{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were sitting on the porch in the evening when an we noticed a glowing object coming from the southwest in a straight line heading to the northeast. At first you always think it must be an airplane or helicopter but there were no flashing lights or noise. It was just a big orange light, not pulsating just a constant glow flying slowly across the sky in a straight line above the tree line but below where's you normally see small aircraft. My kids and I watched the object until it finally was too far north and east to see. I was in the military and have been around and worked on planes flying at night, this did not look like any aircraft that I've seen."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Frederick","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.101322,+-104.937755(42332)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42332) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"42332","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/06/2012 11:14 UTC","Latitude":"40.101322","Date of the Event":"07/16/2012 09:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42332.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42332.html"],"Longitude":"-104.937755","Log Number":"US-09062012-0007","City":"Frederick","Summary":"Saw an orange shape coming from S/SW in a straight line going N/NE","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
