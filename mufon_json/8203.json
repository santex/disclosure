As I was driving home on 281 in the direction to Burnet from Marble Falls. I noticed a fairly bright light in the sky to my 10:30. I first thought was it was a star although once I looked again I knew it was much too bright to be a star. Secondly there had been a storm gathering for the last couple of hours and you couldn���t make out any of the sky from all the clouds. As I drove further it got my direct attention when I noticed it appeared to be moving due east... I stares for a numbed of sec hard to see if I noticed any blinking or flashing to represent a plane. That���s when I realized how low and close to it I was. By that time it was making its way across the highway in a wave like motion. My heart started pumping and I realized what it was. Well at least what it was not. I sped up to get as close to the object as I could. About that time it was as if it was floating down like a feather. My visual was interrupted by the tree line. I then circled the area multiple times. But had no luck seeing it again."],"Date Submitted":"10/22/2007 11:08 UTC","Summary":"Driving home and I spotted a bright light to my 10:30.
