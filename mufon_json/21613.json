This object was much bigger than a star and became stationary for approx two minutes before disappearing. We heard on our local radio station the following morning that this object had also been seen by people on Corralejo, our nearest town and also on the island of Tenerife, the Tenerife sighting is actually on 'You Tube'. We had a sighting here last new years eve which we informed you about and are always looking !!! We were pleased to have seen something else - I can't wait for them to land and come and see us !!!!! Believe 100%, know they have been here for ever and look forward for disclosure which must happen soon, the governments must stop covering up such an important fact !! What has happened to Dr Steven Greer's letter to the President of the US regarding this ???"],"Latitude":"28.610399","City":"La Oliva","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There has been one other sighting in La Oliva","There were no other sightings in La Oliva on or around December 31st 2009"],"Longitude":"-13.928803","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"ES-01242010-0006","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"21613","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"Spain","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/24/2010 06:40 UTC"}
