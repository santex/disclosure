(i'm thinking back and maybe it was a new moon, and that's why i couldn't see anything but the windows). i would estimate the speed at about 300 mph. there was no sound. i would estimate the size similar to a 707 airliner or maybe a little larger, although the windows were much bigger then on a typical airliner. if you held a ruler at arms length, it would have measured about 4-1\\2 inches across when it passed near the car. it was not marsh gases either! when i first saw the object it was about 1000 feet off of my 4 o'clock position and about a 1000 feet high. the upward viewing angle was close to 45 degrees. by the time my dad saw it through the front windshield, it was about 500 feet off my 2 0'clock position and still flying at the same altitude. at that time our upward viewing angle was about 60 degrees and it eventually crossed our path, maybe an 1\\8 mile up the road. when the craft circled wonderland center the altitude was probably closer to 2500 to 3000 feet. it did not fly irratically. it was very smooth. my feelings were mixed, for as cool as it was, i was scared s***less. i didn't have nightmares, but i was always watching my back for several years after. at school i remember telling my close friend ron a. about what occurred the night before. he didn't believe me, but i guess that was expected. i'm a former graphic artist so i enclosed a map of livonia michigan which shows the ufo's flight path. the story begins at the yellow circle and star. the colors correspond to where the car was in relation to where the ufo was. i also enclosed a computer generated illustration of the ufo. if you size the ufo drawing on your monitor to 4-1\\2 inches wide, that's about how big it appeared in the sky. it was huge! if you have any information related to this ufo incident, or if the description is similar to another sighting, please let me know. thank you."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27676.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27676_submitter_file1__LivoniaUFOFlightPath1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27676_submitter_file2__LivoniaUFOFlightPath2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27676_submitter_file3__LivoniaUFOOctober1966.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27676.html"],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Livonia","There were no other sightings in Livonia on or around September 30th 1966","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Livonia","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"27676","Latitude":"42.37413","Summary":"Low flying and slow moving UFO, You could clearly see the windows rotate slowly around the disc shape."}
