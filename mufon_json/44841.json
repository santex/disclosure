The object appeared to hover then proceed in a zig zag path to the east. It started out very white and bright then it changed to blue-white and appeared to get brighter. the object then appeared to ascend slowly getting dimmer as it continued to move in a zig zag pattern to the east. No sound or FAA lights observed. the object then went out or disappeared. Total time was about 5 min. Very simular to and object I witnessed last summer 7-29-2012 but the coler was white to blue-white not orange like the one this past summer. I thought at first it was a small plane but it made no sound, no FAA lights. I noticed it because it was about 2x as bright as jupiter which I was observing with my telescope."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date of the Event":"12/28/2012 05:30 UTC","Summary":"Bright object that hovered then proceeded in a zig zag path to the east","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around December 28th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.324605,+-73.230454(44841)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44841) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12292012-0008","Latitude":"41.324605","Case Number":"44841","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Monroe","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Connecticut","Longitude":"-73.230454"}
