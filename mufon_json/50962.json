I never lost satellite radio reception and the antenna was on my dash. I should've lost radio reception seconds after it appeared. The fact I still had reception may be a clue to more about it."],"trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around March 1st 2008"],"Latitude":"40.723743","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Other","Summary":"triangle hovered over my truck as I drove","Case Number":"50962","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Longitude":"-74.004673","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"New York"}
