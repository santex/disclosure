But it didn't make any sound . It looked like it had passed over the house at about 50 feet in the air . I watched it it traveled about around 300 feet or so and .It looked like it landed in the field the shape went dark . So me and my nephew went out side to take a look . It was dark , but we then seen a white light .I was bigger than a football ,but shaped like one.As it moved across the field the light went off and on .
