(around 3 minutes) i lost sight of it as it became visually obscured by the roof of the three storey property. it made no noise. around 20 seconds later a second appeared following the same trajectory. at this point i thought that planes could not fly on the same \"path\" so closely? again with 20 second intervals, 2 more orange glows (couldn't make out a shape) followed. the fifth and last had a much steeper trajectory of ascent - closer to that of a rocket.(from my perspective) i was able to scrutinize this one very well as i had walked around \"behind\" to get the best look i could. whilst i am not 100%, it appeared that the light was emitting from the front-half, whilst the form behind the light appeared to be rounded. one week later, on the 5th november(bonfire night)at 10.30pm i saw the exact same objects in the sky, although this time there were only two. the sky was cloudier this night than the first. it was up to my left, a little lower than the previous sighting (at a helicopter altitude) and continued to move very slowly to the left and away from me. (around 2 minutes) it began to fade gradually and entirely dissapear (this may have been due to cloud cover) (fading around 30 seconds) a second appeared again 20 seconds or so later and followed the same path. i didn't want to lose sight of it and didn't think i would have time to find my camera inside. i watched it very closely and noticed there were subtle nuances in its movement. for around 1 second it actually reversed. again this one gradually disappeared (the glow became smaller) like the first and i lost it. *additional details apply to first sighting*"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"5 Orange Lights","Latitude":"51.509769","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"13584","Date Submitted":"09/27/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"England","Date of the Event":"09/27/2008 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13584.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13584.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"GB-11072008-0009","Country":"United Kingdom","City":"London","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.509769,+-0.125225(13584)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13584) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
