My guess it was traveling about 50 to 60 mph.and about 2,000 to 3,000 feet up just my guess. I thought of shining my flash light up at it but had a feeling that may not have been a good idea i hoped that one of my hunting buddies may of seen it also but they were already back from hunting. what ever this was it made no sound no other lights just one very bright light that covered the bottom of the Craft. i have seen a lot of satellites in the clear northern sky's but this was just too close to the ground."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8188.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8188.html"],"City":"Roscommon","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10222007-0001"}
