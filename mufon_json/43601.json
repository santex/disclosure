Doing a haunted hayride. Waiting to scare people when I noticed 3 lights appear and I kept thinking, \" please tell me that's an airplane\", so I waited for it to move but it didn't it just hovered. No sound came from it. I looked down to grab my phone, when I looked back up there was a faint light coming from the top of it shining on the clouds and it was just gone. No lights shown through the clouds nothing it just went dark again. I stood there shaking and freaked out for about 10 minutes after that I couldn't stop starting at the sky"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
