The object moved rather slowly across the ski moving from North to South. My friend witnessed this object for a duration of 5 minutes and got a good look at the rectangular object that did not have wings. For a while the object appeared to be following a plane but th plane eventually took a different course and the object dissapeared behind the clouds shrtly after. This friend of mine is a trustworthy person who has been skeptical of the UFO phenomena but now has had a sighting of her own! I trust her word and the description I gave you is indeed acurate to what the witness saw. If you can identify this for us or if anyone else can report seeing something similar we would really apprecite it!
