{"Latitude":"38.990131","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsLeaving my house for my evening walh at about 8:35 I happened to look South West across the valley at the view and noticed a white spherical looking light. It was quite an unusual or out of place object that I trained my eyes on it. The light appeared to hover or move extremely slowly toward rhe east at an altitude I estimated as approximately 3,000 feet. After 30 or 40 seconds it began to perceptably increase its velocity toward the east, Still very slow but oviously moving. At this point it blinked out completely once, then reapeared, then blinked again, and again, appearing smaller each time until it completely disappeared."],"Date Submitted":"06/07/2012 08:38 UTC","Summary":"Object looked like a ball of white light hovering at first, then moving slowly toward the east after about 60 seconds it began to blink a few times then grew smaller and blinked out","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06072012-0024","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Yerington","There were no other sightings in Yerington on or around May 27th 2012"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.990131,+-119.160341(38953)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38953) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/27/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"38953","Country":"United States","Region":"Nevada","Longitude":"-119.160341","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38953.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38953.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Yerington","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
