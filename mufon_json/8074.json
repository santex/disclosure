I thought they could be planes at first, it looked like they were shining because of the sunrise. I was stopped at a light (the longest light in town) just watching these things hover and glint in the light. They didn't move at all. They were at least a few miles east of me, and they hovered. Then, a third one appeared to the north of the other 2. I pulled into the office parking lot and got out of my car. They were still there and I watched them for another minute or 2 and went inside. I didn't say anything to anyone about it. It was just cool to see."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Fort Collins","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/04/2007 06:50 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/04/2007 06:50 UTC"}
