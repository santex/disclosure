I looked up into the sky and saw a orange cigar shaped object moving slowly from the nw. i told my friend to look at this. as we watched, the object stopped and a piece of the same color fell from it. we watched as the piece fell and suddenly burst into flames. the object then moved off in the same direction it came from. I was very excited to see something like this and to this day do not believe it was from earth. my friend who does not believe even after seeing this object was not impressed. when i first saw the object I was I thought it was unusual abecause of the circumstances of its behavior. We had just went to the moon a and I didn't then and still don't believe we had this technology at that time. it was a crystal clear night with many stars. doesn't this prove that it was out of the earths atmosphere because it fell then burst into flames? after over 30 years, this memory is as clear as the day it happened."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"orange cigar shaped object. drops piece of same color that bursts into flames.","Region":"New York","Case Number":"3534","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.322846","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Fulton","There were 4 other sightings in Fulton on or around October 30th 1969"],"City":"Fulton","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07012005-0002","Date of the Event":"10/30/1969 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.322846,+-76.417158(3534)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3534) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"10/30/1969 09:00 UTC"}
