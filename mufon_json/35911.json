I took 5 photos of the clouds. The next day while looking at the pictures on my computer I noticed a spot on one of the photographs and zoomed on it and saw a brown triangle ufo. While I was taking the pictures there were no helicopters, planes or birds in the sky so I don���t know what that was but I didn���t see it with my naked eye, only later on my computer."],"City":"West Palm Beach","Date of the Event":"02/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in West Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in West Palm Beach on or around February 10th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.051785","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"26.719092","Log Number":"US-02182012-0010","Summary":"Triangle UFO near PBIA WPB FL"}
