A vertical pulsating beam of light greenish in color, I was approximately a mile and quarter south of the interstate driving east, the beam descended with quick bursts of even brighter light same in color, and ascended back up, the event lasted around 80 to 90 seconds. Although the distance from the interstate was just little over a mile, it was still softball size and not hard to miss. I hope others will come forward and report the event."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
