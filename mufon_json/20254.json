It was getting late and after wacthing t.v. and last beer,my wife noticed a large Aircraft approaching over the adjacent building (340 Dixon Rd.),we then went on to our balcony so I could guess the plane type.When the aircraft was directly in front of us,(roughly 1 mile away)we were in awe at the aircrafts size which I believe was the new Airbus.I knew this because or the little fin on the wingtip.In a matter of seconds,we saw an intense white light under what appeared to be the fuselage,seemingly detach itself from the underside,pause briefly then zip ahead of the aircraft at a high rate of speed.My wife and I have discussed this all weekend and decided to post this in hopes others may have seen this as well or that someone can verify from other sources this sighting.I have denounced other possibilities for this such as a light falling from the aircraft,but if so it would have decended and trailed behind if that were the case.I���m a believer and we have both witnessed some strange phenomenon over the years but this sighting seals the deal! Please! If anyone from the greater Toronto area seen what we seen or if someone could shed some light on this with a scientific expanantion,It would give us peace of mind!Needsless to say,I find myself now every night before bed staring at the heavens in hopes of maybe recording this on video or get a couple of pictures if ever whatever it was appears again."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.659116,+-79.378564(20254)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20254) map </A>"}
