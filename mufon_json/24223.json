We were talking and looking in the sky to see if there were any local fireworks. At about 9:35 PM we noticed a large glowing orange oval shaped light in the western sky traveling east. The object appeared larger than a plane and we watched it cross the sky to the east until it was no longer in our vision. It crossed the sky in about 1 minute. After it passed we checked the time. At first we thought it may have been a satellite but it was much too low in the sky. It moved in a smooth (not erratic) path and the color was an even glowing orange light."]}
