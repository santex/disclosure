We stopped and I ask my son if he saw what I saw and he did. They were way up and probably over a mile up because they looked small. They were oval shape and white in color. They were not birds or geese. They were up to high and they did not have a typical v geese pattern. They were in a grid pattern side by side but hundreds that filled the sky. I called the state police but they had no reports. I have always wanted to tel our story."],"City":"Eldersburg","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-76.937396","Latitude":"39.393635","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-01052012-0021","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Eldersburg","There were no other sightings in Eldersburg on or around April 6th 1994"],"Summary":"Hundreds of UFO's flying in a tight grid pattern flying in one direction","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.393635,+-76.937396(34636)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34636) map </A>","Case Number":"34636","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
