{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas sitting in the Carls JR. restaurant on Marconi Avenue in Sacramento, near the corner of Eastern Avenue and Mission Avenue. While talking to my wife I noticed that below tree level in the distance there was a cigar shaped UFO cruising. I saw it cruise between trees and when I had looked to see if it would reappear between other trees it did not reappear. It looked like the fuselage of a large airliner but had no wings or tail and it was flying too low to be an airplane. I estimate that it was about half a mile from my location and it was traveling from east to west. If it was at the distance that I thought it to be at I estimate that it would have been a hundred feet off of the ground. It had no lights and appeared to be a dark gray color on the bottom with a light gray color on the top. I chose to mark that it was cigar shaped because I saw only the side of the object but my conclusions are that it was disk shaped but a thick disk, long, convex on the top and bottom and with flat edges. I am a field invesitgator with MUFON and state that what I have described is as accurate as I can recount. To my knowledge, nobody else in the restaurant observed the object. My wife had her back to the event and it happened quite quickly."],"Summary":"Cigar shape UFO seen at tree level.","Log Number":"US-12292008-0005","Longitude":"-121.48817","Case Number":"14592","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14592.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"12/19/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.589842","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Sacramento","Date Submitted":"12/19/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around December 19th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.589842,+-121.48817(14592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14592) map </A>"}
