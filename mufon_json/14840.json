We saw it fly across the sky at a gradual speed, when it got near the end of my vision it sped up forward then came back across the sky from where it started from then forward across again and then dissappeard. This happened all in about 1 -2 minutes. I didn't say anything to my wife, but she is the one who immediately asked me if I saw the same thing and I did. It looked like an orange star, it was about th same size. But it obviously wasn't because flying stars don't go back and forth."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"The shape flew across the sky.
