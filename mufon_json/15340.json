I looked outside, and didn't really see many stars, they were all small and faded, nor did I see the moon from the angle I was at, I was about to go around to the other side of the house when I saw a really bright object in the sky, it was a star like object, very bright, seemed far away, it may have been pulsating but it stayed pretty bright for a while. I saw an object like this before, it was moving and pulsating, this was reported to MUFON. When I looked at it through the binoculars, I thought I saw a shape inside of the light, I however; cannot be sure. I was able to take some low quality footage of this, the shaking is because I was having a hard time holding the camera still."],"Case Number":"15340","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"02/05/2009 08:40 UTC","Summary":"Star-Like UFO","Longitude":"-76.882248","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Harrisburg","There were no other sightings in Harrisburg on or around February 5th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
