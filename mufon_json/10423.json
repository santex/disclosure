It is a very clear view from the living room straight out the window to the mountain in front of our house. She looked out the window and saw a white ball of light the size of a quarter flying rapidly from the SW of the mountain in front of her house about 300 yards in the sky and about half a mile away. the object flew very rapidly, faster than a jet, to the N, and partly downward towards the mountain before it disappeared in front of their eyes before it reached the mountain. it was the first UFO her husband had ever seen and he was amazed. Ann was very casual about seeing it. Ann has had so many UFO sightings they are commonplace to her. She enjoys seeing them but not excited at all."],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"A white ball of light flew across sky","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.445727,+-123.324332(10423)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10423) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04192008-0011","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/16/1997 10:46 UTC","Region":"Oregon","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Grants Pass","There were no other sightings in Grants Pass on or around June 16th 1997"],"Date Submitted":"06/16/1997 10:46 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.445727","Weather Factors":"None"}
