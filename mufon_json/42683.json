It was in the early afternoon on a Saturday. At first I thought it was the Goodyear Blimp. I observed it for about 10 minutes and then lost sight of it because the road changed directions. Then I saw it again and it appeared to have traveled east faster than I did. It did not seem to be traveling fast enough to be an airplane. It was kind of floating. There was another similar object traveling in tandem with it. The material seemed to be reflective. There was a light cloud cover and and the objects were visible through it. The object moved toward the southeast and went out of view. I was very curious and wondered if there was a football game somewhere and this was some kind of blimp. When it kept going in a relatively straight path, I wondered if it was a UFO."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Nebraska","Date of the Event":"09/15/2012 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09202012-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.808762,+-96.679589(42683)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42683) map </A>","Case Number":"42683","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42683.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42683.html"],"Country":"United States"}
