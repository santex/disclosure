I took several digital pictures of unusual cloud formations. When looking at them later this evening, I noticed a trigualr shape in the lower center of the photo. When zoomed in, tt seems to have several other objects surrounding it in a half moon forward position. I have not altered this picture in any way. I did not see this object at the time of the photo and have no idea what it is, perhaps nothing. Just thought you might be interested.
