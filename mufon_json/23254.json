{"Latitude":"42.375959","Region":"Oregon","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent out to my car during a short break, and since I have an amature astronomer, I tend to look up in the sky at night a lot. I noticed a bright object in the sky flying from east to west towards the Medford, Or airport. I retrieved my binocular (Nikon SE 10X42)and focused on this object and quickly determined that it was not a commercial or military craft as it had no running lights. I watched it for about 10 seconds and realized that I needed a witness and so I ran back inside and got Brian and Tex who ran out and saw it for about 10 seconds or so. As we watched it, it changed direction slightly to the right (now travelling southeast) when it suddenly veered upward at great speed and disappeared. I was first in our companies parking lot when I first saw the object. I new very quickly that I was observing a craft not of conventional design as there were no running lights on the object. It was quite bright."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Central Point","There were no other sightings in Central Point on or around May 12th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"05/12/2010 10:03 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Central Point","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/13/2010 01:46 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.375959,+-122.916431(23254)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23254) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05132010-0002","Longitude":"-122.916431","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright, oval craft (slight pulsation) flew over my work (radio station)","Case Number":"23254","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23254.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23254.html"]}
