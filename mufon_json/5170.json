The left one faded, then the center faded, then the right one faded. they were illuminated long enough for me to say, \"what the #*%! is that\" and drop the flashlight. we then returned to the beach and less that five minutes later witnessed the same type of event with greater number of lights, growing off of a beginning one and forming a string of maybe 10 lights. this time much farther away, smaller that a pea at arms length. it happened twice, 30 seconds apart, second one having greater number of lights. total time each formation was illuminated was 10 - 15 seconds. these were not flares or fireworks. they moved with precission on a perfect horizontal path. silent. like a glowing string of pearls. i believe, a group of people on a neighboring deck witnessed the same event. i have yet to talk about it with them. I first thought the object were fireworks but they hovered and moved horizontal. when i we saw them on the second time it was confirmed that they were not fireworks. when we saw the lights, the second time they appeared near a large cloud formation. we were completed fascinated when we witnessed this. i have never seen anything that i could not easily explain. i was just wishing i had my camera!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5170.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5170.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/17/2006 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.159974","Log Number":"US-07312006-0005","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/17/2006 12:00 UTC"}
