The entire episode took only about 2 minutes or so but it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up; I don't know of any man-made aircraft or even spacecraft that can move like that. What I witnessed totally defies the laws of physics as I know them to be."],"City":"Escondido","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27263.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27263.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Region":"California","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.127857,+-117.076491(27263)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27263) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Escondido","There were no other sightings in Escondido on or around January 5th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"01/05/2011 06:05 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Date Submitted":"01/05/2011 09:44 UTC","Log Number":"US-01052011-0015","Longitude":"-117.076491"}
