Just when I focused on it it flashed real bright and then seamed to explode and then move across the night sky. I first thought it was a star. It moved in a linear fashion across the sky from east to west. I was very excited to see the object especially since it was so bright. I lost sight of the object when it faded away and the light got dimmer."],"Latitude":"40.509313","Log Number":"US-10012011-0013"}
