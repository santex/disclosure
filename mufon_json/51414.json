I got up to watch this helicopter searching a area around my place and the shore front. The helicopter had its spot light and a red light on its tail, it could very well have been black because I could not see any color on it when it passed over me. The sky was clear and no obstacle to clear sight of the event. I had laid back down wishing this loud helicopter would leave so I could sleep. I was again out of my bed as I saw a very bright glowing orb hovering down toward the waterfront. It was there for several minutes and then began to descend. Shortly after this orb was gone another one appeared and did the same thing as the first. The helicopter was in the area for everything that occurred."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/09/2013 11:56 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/08/2013 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.893256,+-122.724151(51414)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51414) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"51414","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51414.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51414.html"],"Log Number":"US-10092013-0016","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"At 10 PM I heard a helicopter flying low and was in a search pattern over the area where I live.
