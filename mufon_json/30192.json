I start freaking out and tell my friend to look up at it. He looks, sees it for a moment just as it up and vanishes. It vanished in a blur and was not seen again. Very Bizzare. I was disturbed the rest of the night."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/15/2011 09:04 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"33.386732","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"7 second Wonder","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"30192"}
