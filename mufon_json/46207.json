I sent the photo to the McMillan space observatory in Vancouver BC to see if it was the space station but they said it was not visible during the day and they had no idea what I had photographed. I will leave it up to you to hazard a guess what it is but I know it is not an airplane or a balloon."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Chilliwack","There was one other sighting in Chilliwack on or around March 8th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Chilliwack","Case Number":"46207","Object Features":"Other","Date of the Event":"03/08/2013 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"British Columbia","Summary":"saw i had taken photo only days l;ater","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"49.16514","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46207.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46207.html"],"Log Number":"CA-03142013-0019","Longitude":"-121.946227","Date Submitted":"03/14/2013 11:51 UTC"}
