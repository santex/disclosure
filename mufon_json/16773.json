Sounded like a quiet jet. Lights on the points of the triangle. I thought I saw a vertical stableizer from the rear of the triangle once it passed me. It was flying pretty low maybe 500 ft. or less. I could still hear it for a long time after it was out of site. I pulled up to my house at 602 Iva Ln at 11:38PM Eastern time. As I stepped out of my truck I saw what I thought was just a plane flying at me from the north-east. But it caught my eye because the light configuration seemed different than what Im used to seeing. So I stood in the street and watched it as it flew over my house from North-east to South-west. As it got directly over head i could see from the bottom the craft appeared to be a solid triangle with lights on the points."],"Log Number":"US-05032009-0001","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
