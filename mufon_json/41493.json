I quickly grabbed my smartphone and shot a video. It was moving too slow to be a comet or meteor, it made no noise and did not flash or blink at all. It was just a solid white light moving across the sky. I looked online and the ISS was no where near here, nor were there any known asteroids. I go outside all the time at night to smoke and I love looking up. This is the first time in two years I've ever seen anything move across the sky. I don't believe it was a satellite. I've seen them before living in the country. This was FAR brighter. It's rather hard to see because it was on my cell phone. I'm not one to believe in UFO's and paranormal, but this kind of took me by surprise. I've never seen anything like it."],"Summary":"Brilliant white light moving across Greencastle Sky","Date of the Event":"08/06/2012 09:55 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Greencastle","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41493.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41493.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-77.721366","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
