There was what appeared to be a cigar shaped object right above the highway. It was moving in an eastern direction, however, it was almost hovering (moving very slowly). There were six lights running along the side of the craft. The lights were so extremely bright that I couldn't see what color it was. I see it for approximately 5 minutes and then it disappeared out of view behind the tree lines. Also, many times during the night, there are unexplained crafts in the area."],"Country":"United States"}
