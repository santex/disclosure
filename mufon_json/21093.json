I was making a sandwitch and I was sure to look at the time... it was 12:29 pm... So in the middle of making lunch nothing seemed to have occurred...but it was 2:00 pm after making the sandwitch .... again looking at the clock... 5 minutes at the most went by in my subjective time... but a hour and a half went by objectively... hence missing time I've had many other occurances besides that also...such as telekinesis, teleportation, actually seeing a gigantic ufo and so forth... This stuff has really effected me on many levels... good and bad. Not being able to talk to others about this stuff has impacted me emotionally and intellectually..."]}
