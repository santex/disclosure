And I were playing cards with some friends. It was a very overcast night. I go out the front door to call a friend from college and I notice that there are these bright lights rapidly rotating around a center point in the sky that is obscured by clouds. The lights were moving horizontally in and out of the clouds. There were five lights i could see spaced out across most of my vision. After moving around rapidly in a chaotic manner the lights would return to the middle, slowly go back and again. Then they would start rotating, sometimes slower, sometimes faster. We watched this thing in the sky for about four hours. The lights stayed in relatively the same place the entire.time though. When my cousin left to take our friends home,ten minute there ten minutes back, I stayed up waiting for him to return for an hour and a bOx before falling asleep. He swears he came right back, within twenty minutes."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Coopertown","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-86.967222","Region":"Tennessee","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30760.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30760.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08092011-0012","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"30760","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Coopertown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.437548,+-86.967222(30760)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30760) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
