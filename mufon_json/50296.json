{"Country":"Philippines","divs":["Sighting DetailsHi, I'm Abraham from Philippines. I'm just wondering if any one from your team can investigate this picture that I took about 3 weeks ago. Me and my friend just past by in this rice field near a volcano not to far away from our home, just now i realized there is something out there in the sky that is really weird. When i started browsing my photos from a holiday back in my homeland Philippines. I took this picture using my iPhone 4s so it's not really a high resolution, but attached is the raw file of this photo. Just send me your email address. Thank You."],"Date Submitted":"08/30/2013 03:58 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50296_submitter_file1__photocopy.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50296_submitter_file2__photo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50296.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Legaspi","Log Number":"PH-08302013-0011","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Legaspi","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"124.019583","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"It is a grayish metal, that is flying above the rice field near a Volcano called Mt.
