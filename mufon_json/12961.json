This light appeared like a star just at dusk, and then slowly descended, then headed north very slowly, then straight down. As it descended out of a cloud, the closer it got to the earth, the brighter it got. It seemed like it wasn't moving, until I look at the pictures I took and you could see that indeed it was. It was gold and green and pulsed like a heartbeat. I have several pictures and will attach a few to show the movement. Nothing in the sky that is natural is that bright at night. The moon and Venus were to the left of my vantage point. The view is taken from an overlook facing the front range from the Daniels Park area."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Egg, Oval","Log Number":"US-10082008-0015","Longitude":"-105.773557","Case Number":"12961"}
