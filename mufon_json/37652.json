Was 2-3 times bigger than an aeroplane and around 2 times faster. I've made pictures with iPhone, called outside my wife to see. Was amazing. I posted some of pictures on my Facebook page and gone to shopping. And seen another one from the same direction. A little bit higher. Take my Nikon SLR but struggling with AF and slush light. Of course these pictures are better. After crossing the sky a noisy aeroplane appeared from the same direction. One strange thing has happen. The plane has switched off the position lights except the red one."],"Longitude":"145.279071"}
