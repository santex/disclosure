I noticed a bright object in the sky that looked alot like a star. This object was not moving as if just hovering really high. I watched it for about 3 minutes and it just disappeared. I thought at first it might have been an airplane that the sun was casting a reflection off of, but then I noticed 1. it wasn't moving, and 2. it was between me and the sun. All I could think was what the heck is that. I lost sight of the object as it looked as if it just disappeared."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/22/2010 10:34 UTC","Log Number":"US-10222010-0007","Case Number":"26027","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in McEwen","There were no other sightings in McEwen on or around October 22nd 2010"],"City":"McEwen","Summary":"Starlike Object in sky.
