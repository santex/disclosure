I was about 14 years old at the time. It was midday with a clear blue sky with high puffy white clouds and good visibility. We all observed and object that looked almost like a piece of wood (like a 2 x 4) in color and shape. This object appeared to be about 5 to 7 feet long and it was revolving around it center axis in a horizontal plane. The revolutions were slow (maybe 8 to 10 per minute)and it was not making any sort of noise. There were no lights or any variations in it color or any sort of markings. The object appeared to be about 50 to 75 feet above the ground and well below any clouds in the sky. The object appeared without warning and moved in a straight line at a constant height above the ground. I would estimate it's speed at 10 to 12 miles per hour. We three boys found the object very strange and started to chase it to see what it might be. it It moved in a northeasterly direction and we vollowed it for several minutes until we got into some thicker woods and could no longer keep up with it's speed. We did not experience any adverse effects from this experience and there was no sense that the object detected our presence. We never heard anything more about this sighting and never saw it again. I have never talked to anyone that saw a similiar object at that time or since. I would like to know if this type of object has ever been reported by others or in the Western Pennsylvania region?"],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Case Number":"8581","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.42118,+-79.788102(8581)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8581) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None"}
