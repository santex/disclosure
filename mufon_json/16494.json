The was no tail, it was circular in shape, and look to me like some sort or continuous electrical spark. There was light blue and white. No orange, red, or yellow or any color to indicate a flame or combustion. It went overhead VERY fast in a Northeasterly direction and appeared to be falling, or crashing. We continued on the highway, but could see no smoke, flames, or fire. Me and my buddy could not figure out what it was based on the event alone. We kept and eye and ear open for any news on what happened. but have not heard anything since."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","Case Number":"16494","Log Number":"US-04132009-0005","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Longitude":"-97.741501","Summary":"UFO falling/crashing in North Austin","Country":"United States"}
