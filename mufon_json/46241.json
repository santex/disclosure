it was as if it were jumping up and down like a five year old that was told they were going to chuck-e-cheese. the lights moved left, right, left, right, & then clear white. i mean, white. this was the most pure white color, and moved around like a dime on a washing machine. now, nobody's hands are perfectly steady when looking through binos but it was a major difference between the movement of the ufo to that of a star when framed together. i also watched a plane though them. one thing i cannot do so far is tell what shape this thing is. it appears long and flat, but i wouldn't bet money on it or anything. the location where i've witnessed this was south of buffalo ny in lakeview. this was not over lake erie itself, but inland. i have witnessed it for several weeks and on several occasions often for several hours. i'm going to take a break again now, i'll come back with any details feel important if i've forgotten any.... ... well, its now 12:10pm over an hour since the beginning of the sighting today & nothing major, except that it has stopped moving around... at all. just sitting there flashing every once in a while. as far as how i felt when i first saw this, well, i didn't feel anything strange. or, honestly anything. i saw what i saw, and it is what it is. i've lived on the lake for 15+ years and have seen a few ufos\\strange phenomenon, but the frequency of this has made it hard for me to ignore & leave un-reported. it is time we all stop denying serious investigation into it, and demand disclosure. people sing the song-sheet of calling people crazy or dismissing sightings because we have basically been programmed to. i encourage that anybody in the buffalo area look to the skies to see if they see this ufo too, & i know i'm not the only one who has because i commented on a sighting that happened just a few days before my first one. we need to have serious investigation & serious discussion on the topic, and not be afraid or ashamed to speak because of what people will think. thanks for reading. db from lakeview ny"],"Case Number":"46241","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.728434,+-78.945633(46241)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46241) map </A>","Region":"New York","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.728434","Sighting Duration":"01:10:00"}
