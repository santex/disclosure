I bright orange glow went by, above it was a glowing ring. My son (age 6) said it was a \"flying mushroom\". My neighbors kids (age 5-8, three of them) said it was a \"ballon\". The object was moving roughly east to west. It went directly across the sky. I knew it was too fast for a helicopter, Not too fast for a jet though. I knew it was not anything I had ever seen before. I called it in to the local police. I was curious to see if any one else had called it in. There were a lot of fireworks in the area, many people must have been looking up. This object traveled across the sky, not up or down. It looked the size of a US Quarter. I lost sight of the object when trees blocked my view."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17792.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17792.html"],"Log Number":"US-07042009-0013","Object Shape":"Egg"}
