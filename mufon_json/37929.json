We all turn around and witness two fireball like spheres glided in-sync across the sky heading westward. Did not make any sounds or any change in elevation before disappearing over the tree line. We all stayed calm and unaffected during and after the sighting. I'm a sceptic of this type of thing so I would really like to know what it was and if anyone else can account for this. I noticed a post on this site of almost the exact same event which happened a year ago to the day. Make me wonder if it an annual flight test of some kind."],"City":"Austin","Summary":"Two fireball like spheres glided in-sync across the sky heading westward.
