It appeared to accellerate at great speed south then almost instantly disappear...visibility was clear and perfect...we had feeling of witnessing something out of the ordinary. It was no bird, plane, balloon . We also witnessed what appeared to be a fast moving jet circling the area for a few minutes after we arrived home which was maybe 5 minutes from initial sighting...i continued to watch the sky and noticed the lack of air traffic almost like it was diverted from the area as for that time of day i would have expected to see commercial aircraft...the fast moving jet was no commercial flight...i watched it from my backyard appearing to be patrolling the area...the jet doubled back then went away...it was exciting ! It was no airplane or any vehicle with exhaust...to fly away like it did i estimate thousands of miles per hour...Leo Chamberlain"],"Region":"Kentucky","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"01/03/2012 04:30 UTC","Summary":"brother and i witnessed a bright object in sky, cigar or saucer shaped that had no control in cold perfect clear sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34568.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34568.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.287684","Date Submitted":"01/03/2012 08:02 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.750227,+-84.287684(34568)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34568) map </A>","Case Number":"34568"}
