It flew in a circle pattern 2 times then slowed down to almost a stand still. The light then began tracking to the right slowly and then to the left slowly. It entered what looked like a geo synchronous orbit and then changed its color to red and then back to white. It dimmed out several times and became brighter again. We watched it until it set behind the hill to the west. We could tell it was moving against the stars in the sky until it finally stopped and locked orbit. At first while watching the object we were wowed by it."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11172009-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20567.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20567.html"],"Country":"United States"}
