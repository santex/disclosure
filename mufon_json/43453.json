I zoomed in and was astonished as to what I saw . I am a paranormal investigator and this immediately seemed odd with me so I shared it with a team member and he used crude software and enhanced the pics and even this low quality is still unexplainable to me . My friend said she didn't see anything apparent or hear anything but that it has just begun to rain and she was standing outside ."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Square, Rectagular","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
