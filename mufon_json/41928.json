We were camping and stargazing when we noticed this bright orange-red light come from the nw and travelled in a slightly curved path(what looked to be along the atmosphere. The light was very obvious, one of the brightest in the sky. We didn't know what the light was as it was a red orange colour and appeared to be much closer than any other stars, it was not blinking or anything. It followed this path for 4 or 5 minutes and the speeds really seems to increase and decrease randomly. The object then took a sharp turn to the right and was continuing at the same speed when all of a sudden the speed increased 4 or 5 times faster than it was going before and it appeared to be sucked out of the atmosphere, but the light was bright enough that you could see it was going further away, not just a light burning out. WE all had no idea what we had seen and were quite taken back."],"Log Number":"CA-08222012-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41928.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41928.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Orange light came from just above tree line sparatically changing speeds straight then cut right, increased speed and looked to be sucked out of atmosphere.","City":"Madawaska","Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"41928","Region":"Ontario","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/22/2012 06:53 UTC"}
