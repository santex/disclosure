Mr. _____ heard noises andthought someone was moving around in his basement, so he went there to check. He saw no one.

He went outside to check at 12:18 a.m. He saw no one, butthen saw a large round white light in the Southeastern sky. It was not movingat the time, so he went into the house for his 7x35 Sears binoculars. (578 at1,000 yds.) He said to his wife, \"Get up, you have to see this!\"The light was dimmed (by the haze?) but with the naked eye it appeared the sizeof an orange held at arms length and through the binoculars it filled half thefield of vision.

They all agreed there were three rows of rectangularlime-green lights for a total of 12 lights.The object remained in the same place for 20 minutes without moving, then thegreen lights went out. _____ told investigator that when the green lights wentout, they saw a little red light under the white object and slightly to theright. The object started to move in an erratic pattern, described by the 3witnesses as a \"sky show\". They said during the acrobatics which continueduntil about 1:30 a.m., the object made movements at various times as shown bythe sketch included within the report. It would often stop and hover.

The white light appeared to bebrighter in the center than at the edges, but he haze made it difficult toperceive any details. Mr. _______ called the Lansing Capitol City Airport andControl reported nothing on their radar.At about 1:30 a.m. an officer from the Sheriffs Department arrived and saw theobject at a great distance (estimated 3 to 5 miles), then watched it as it camecloser and moved back again.
