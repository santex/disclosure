We were standing to the back of the friends apartment has a cigarette near the lake. I looked at the water and saw red dots reflected from the sky. I turned up to the sky, and saw 6 sometimes 7 red dots hovering then moving in a line up over the building and stopping. There were definately 6 spheres to close together to be an airplane. The 7th one was blinking and disappearing and reappearing. They all stopped abovethe roof of the building, the 7th one blinked 3 times on, off, on, off, on, off. The other 6 flashed on, then off one time- and they were gone consumed by the darkness. ( for 3 years i never knew i could report this!!! ) I really wish i would have gotten photos"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:06:21","Longitude":"-80.219069","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"44514","Summary":"small round lights just after midnite of the new year","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/13/2012 08:53 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"25.797629","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around December 31st 2009"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/31/2009 12:00 UTC"}
