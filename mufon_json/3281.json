It was an extremely large Triangular craft with red glowing lights underneath it, fading in and out. It was a good distance out, bout three clicks. Flying really low above the tree line. Nothing like we have seen before. We see aircraft daily here in the warzone. Someone knows about this besides us, right after it dissapeared, aircraft appeared in its location circling the area as if too find it, or shoot it down. Made the report, but only recieved laughs, but we saw this huge craft with our own eyes."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"BaghdÄd","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Baghdad","There were no other sightings in Baghdad on or around February 14th 2005"],"Latitude":"33.33248"}
