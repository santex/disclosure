{"City":"Anjou","Latitude":"45.603867","Case Number":"42158","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"Canada","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at home, Went out on my balcany to have a smoke, When I looked up NW toward the autoroute 25 I noticed this thing just hovering about 500 Ft away from my house, It was a trinagle shaped type of aircraft (Using aircraft cause I would not know what else to call it apart from UFO) No sounds that I could hear from it, But it is very windy, It had solid lights on green blue white. I know it's not our airforce... By the time I went inside to get a pair of bonoculars the object was out of sight due to trees. I called my sister and mother whom live not to far and they noticed the lights but the object seemed to be heading west toward the Montreal west island.. On another note this morning August 30th 2012 at 03:40 (Aprox) I noticed strange lights in the sky but thought nothing of it and this morning it was cloudy not as tonight."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Quebec","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42158.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42158.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/30/2012 08:49 UTC","Log Number":"CA-08302012-0020","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.603867,+-73.557342(42158)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42158) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.557342","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/30/2012 09:10 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Anjou","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"It was not a plane"}
