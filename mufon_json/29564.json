The area of town i was in at that time of night was a darker area of town, the sky was very clear, clearer than i had seen in a very long time, What caught my attention was a bright light from my peripheral , i was like i said unloading pallet, so i wasnt really paying any attention to the sky at the moment but out of my peripheral i saw something get really bright in the sky, i looked to the direction it was coming from and saw what looked to me as a star that had gotten bright and i watched it slowy dim to nothing just disapeared. This was very high in the sky, thats why i said it was star like, but why it went bright then dimmed to nothing , i told my wife maybe i witnessed an exploding star or something, but i know what i saw, and that is why i am writing , thought i would share with everyone, maybe someone might know what it was... thanks..."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Somerset","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.093424,+-84.629909(29564)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29564) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Case Number":"29564","Longitude":"-84.629909","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29564.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29564.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/12/2011 11:55 UTC"}
