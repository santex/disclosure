I looked up and watched a plane fly overhead; next to the plane I noticed a white dot. I watched this object sit there until it started to move across the sky, I got my camcorder and started filming. I was excited to think that this might be my first UFO sighting. I lost sight of the object when it became tough to look up into the sunlight sky. Only when I put the file on my computer could I see the other object come into view during the last 40 seconds. Slowing down the video made the object stick out and truly show how fast it moved."],"City":"Centerville","Latitude":"39.633263"}
