I looked up at the constellation Orion and saw a VERY bright flash of extremely white light. It only lasted a split second and was located between the belt and the head of Orion close to the center star in the belt. I have never seen anything like this and continued to watch for about 30 more minutes until my neck got sore. I did a Google search on the internet and was amazed to see I was not the only one to see this. I am extremely curious as to what it was."]}
