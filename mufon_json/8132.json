The UFO suddenly stopped and reversed direction retracing its path several times. It reversed direction in the sky 5 times before moving west. The lights at first looked very much like a plane with the exception of being very bright. The configuration was wrong for a plane as well. On the end pointing toward the west it started out as being green. The next light in the middle was red then the light on the east side was a bright strobing white light. The red and green lights were slowly pulsating and eventually all the lights turned to red. The strobing light also went to red. The duration of the incident was about 3 minutes. The craft eventually kept going west and we could not see it as it went behind a large oak tree. The distance from us was difficult to judge. Perhaps 5 miles or so. We used binoculars to watch it but could not make out what the shape was. I would say that by the configuration of the lights that it appeared to be cigar shaped. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else in the area saw this as well."],"Latitude":"27.666087","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.507054","Date Submitted":"10/12/2007 02:05 UTC","Region":"Florida","trends":[],"Case Number":"8132","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
