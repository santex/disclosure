{"Case Number":"48145","Longitude":"-83.414116","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 10:30pm I happened to look out my window of my 3rd story apartment building to see if the wind was blowing in. I looked up in the sky and saw 3 chinese lanterns flying in a triangle formation. I thought to myself, \"this is neat I hope it lasts.\" After I thought this I noticed that these chinese lanterns were flying against the wind in an almost perfect triangle formation. They were also changing colors from red, to blue, to green, and to orange. The triangle shape was not solid in the middle because the orbs were not flying in a perfect geometric triangle. These orbs in the triangle formation flew over the apartment building across the court yard and then flew over mine. It was moving very slow. I lost the sighting when the object flew over my building. I could have rushed outside and got a perfect picture but I decided not to because I was a little scared of what I saw. I have also heard stories about people in suits who show up at your door after a sighting and demand that you never speak a word of what you saw. I did not want that hassle."],"Log Number":"US-06152013-0006","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.930557,+-83.414116(48145)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48145) map </A>","Summary":"Pulsating lights flying over apartment complex","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"06/15/2013 09:01 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Monroe","Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around June 14th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48145.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48145.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/14/2013 10:20 UTC","Latitude":"41.930557"}
