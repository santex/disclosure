I was going through her photo's looking for those of Venice as I was recently there. I noticed an odd object in the attached photo. You can see it is not a pigeon, maybe a helicopter? Definitely not an airplane. No oen appears to be looking up. My cousin did not recall this object. She did not take the picture because of it. She was photographing St. Mark's Square. I thought it appeared odd to be \"hovering,\" over the square.
