{"City":"Liberty","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving Northwest on 291 Hwy when I noticed a white shiny object moving slowly across the sky. At first I thought it was a large plane, but it had no wings or tail. It looked like two oval-shaped objects with a piece connecting them in the center. As I watched, it stopped and went backwasrds, then forward again very quickly, then continued on its slow forward movement. This happened again, then I lost sight of it because I had to turn left at a light. I pulled over to the side of the road to see if I could find it again, but it was gone. Due to the fast jerky movements backward, then forward again, this could not have been a plane or helicopter. It moved too fast for that. The object was headed in an East-West direction at 40 degrees off the horizon. It looked very large. The sky was clear with no overcast."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/05/2010 12:41 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.252964","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"22645","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22645.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-94.414898","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"Double-oval object over Liberty, MO","Log Number":"US-04052010-0003","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Liberty","There were no other sightings in Liberty on or around April 2nd 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.252964,+-94.414898(22645)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22645) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/02/2010 10:00 UTC"}
