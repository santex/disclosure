{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was online talkin with my friend when my mom called and said she would be home soon. as i was on the phone i was walking around the living room and looked out the window and noticed a large thin black cigar with a light gray stripe down the middle length-wise shaped object hovering in the sky it didn't move at all and i heard no noise. i couldn't tell what the object was at first so i looked hard and still couldn't guess what the object was but it didn't look like any aircraft i had ever seen. It had to be a few miles away but i would guess it was a few hundred feet long. when i noticed i told my mom and friend but about 23 seconds after i noticed the object it just faded away.After that i didn't see anything else wierd."],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Cigar","Latitude":"41.5076","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05142009-0011","Region":"Rhode Island","Date Submitted":"05/14/2009 04:11 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.5076,+-71.716178(16926)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16926) map </A>","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:23","Date of the Event":"05/14/2009 04:11 UTC","Case Number":"16926","Summary":"Black cigar.","City":"Hopkinton","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16926.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16926.html"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hopkinton","There were no other sightings in Hopkinton on or around May 14th 2009"],"Longitude":"-71.716178","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
