{"Summary":"This is a very strange UFO","Case Number":"34426","Region":"North Carolina","divs":["Sighting Details This is one very strange looking UFO, Earlier that morning (12-30-2011) I reported UFO sightings to MUFON; my intention at this time was to take photos of commercial airlines with contrails to use as a photo simulation and try to show what I saw that morning. As reported to MUFON, it was not evident at that time until the photos were downloaded onto my computer that I had actually captured 2 UFO���s on the same photo along with commercial aircraft and contrails. Camera and tripod (Canon Rebel T3 with 300 mm zoom lens) I was not expecting to see anything until I was surprised by this craft which came from my right side and passed in front of me I believe approximately 500-1000 feet up it was close. I quickly took the picture and was not able to take a second one, it was no longer there The UFO in the photo as my wife says it looks like the lamppost we have outside I suppose it does, I took a photo of the lamppost exactly where I photographed the UFO. (Photo attached) The lamppost has trees in between sky and lamppost so therefore it���s a UFO captured on the photo.
