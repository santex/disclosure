After The Fireworks display we were waiting in traffic and noticed Two large round Glowing objects Hovering over the Full moon. Cheri and her boyfriend were in the truck in front of our car and started pointing to the sky and Duke and i saw it also. we watched them intently and there was no sound. There were several hundred people around . These Objects Hovered around pulsating ,first stationary then Moving around the full Moon. making weird movements. Then We looked away for a second to turn into a parking area so we could watch them and They disappeared! They were one fourth the size of the Moon in comparison. And Moved erratically ,and were silent . I wondered if were there any more strange reports about Unidentified Flying Objects that night? I researched Google and there were many UfO sightings on July 4th and July 5th ,2012 around the Full Moon."]}
