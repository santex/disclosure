The spinning, hovering disc remained stationery for a while (I was so stunned it may have been longer or shorter than I remember) and abruptly disappeared. The disc was rimmed with many brightly colored rectangles. There were many witnesses pointing to the sky. A neighbor was filming the event. I am hoping someone will corroborate my account."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/30/1995 12:00 UTC"}
