I thought maybe it was geese far up until i realized they had no flapping movement, were in circular formations, and moved much faster then even the planes landing at the airport which fly in from the south, over my apartment. Those are going 200-300kmh so these white disks were much faster. I guessed their height to only be about 1000m, but hard to tell if they were massive and far up, or smaller and closer to the ground. They were completely silent. Whenever jets fly over, the foundation of my apartment shakes, especially during the annual air show and windows are always open. Once out of the horizon I couldn���t see them anymore. The whole experience lasted about 10 seconds so I had no chance to grab the MiniDV or binoculars. I was also pretty shocked and confused. Roughly 10 minutes later I could hear the sound of Jets in the air but I couldn���t see anything. Perhaps just a plane leaving the airport but I am in a smaller city of 200,000. The airport normally doesn't have flights that late. I'm about 50 kms from Dundurn a Military Base. I���ve always been skeptical so I have no idea what it is I saw. What was rather strange about them, is the almost transparent 'skin'. Like a jelly fish. *Below is a Photoshop composition I made. I didn't get the scale correct, they were much further up in the sky.*"],"Summary":"Looked out the window, 2 massive white disks flew over","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"52.14087","Case Number":"21306","Longitude":"-106.646256","Date Submitted":"01/01/2010 04:54 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/26/2009 02:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Saskatoon","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Saskatoon","There were no other sightings in Saskatoon on or around September 26th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-01012010-0017","Source":"MUFON"}
