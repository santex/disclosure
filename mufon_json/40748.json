When I looked upward in the direction o Perseus constellation a orangish light drew my attention. It was stationed in the sky without making any noise. Orange light after a while started to move upward. The ascending continued for a about 1 minute before the object stop again. At this moment the orange light moved eastward and covering the distance between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor Constellations. After moving eastward or to the right side of my FOV the object suddenly stopped up and hide behind trees that were so high that could cover that part of sky. Orange light in this while started to blink and the luminosity started to decrease. At this moment I had to say hello to some of my friend and family member so I could not watch the sky. When i wanted to watch it again the object was gone and in spite of the way that I stood under the sky for half an hour i tried to found it again I did not see anything else. I'm an astronomy teacher and it is about 15 years that my life is filled with celestial and astronomical events. I can completely distinguish a UFO from a star or meteor and of course a plane or Satellite. This was not like anything that I've ever seen before���"],"Longitude":"51.362304","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.765162","Date of the Event":"07/13/2012 09:14 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/12/2012 05:22 UTC"}
