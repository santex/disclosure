The one guy said he watched it shoot backwards then stay still and thats when he screamed for his friend to look which is when it got my attn. I ran over and they tried to take pics and there cellphones werent working so I ran back and got my camera that was in the truck. I just got back to a clearing by them when I zoomed in and took a picture, a second later it was gone it disappeared as if you stomped on a soda can to flatten it. After me and the pool cleaners talked about what we just saw and the picture on my camera wouldnt show up. When I putt the sd card in my computer when I got home it was there. Ive been scared to come forward because of gov and other people. Id like for someone to give me an answer Ive been having bad headaches and trouble sleeping at night since. I also noticed black helicopters in the air that day. All I know is that what me and the 2 others saw WAS NOT of this planet. If anyone wants too meet up and see the sd card with the original picture and pictures before and after please let me know."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/17/2013 12:03 UTC","Case Number":"45272","Summary":"Palm Harbor Park Daytime sighting"}
