{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were outside walking across the yard.I noticed a very bright light in the sky almost directly overhead.It was moving faster than an aircraft.It was totally silent,never making a sound.the light was steady until it was halfway across the sky at which point it suddenly dimmed to red.At this point it simply vanished as if a light switch was turned off.There was never any contrail from the object.There was nothing in view to gage size,but I got the impression the object was large. I hold Masters degree's in Physics and Aeronautical Engineering and can state that this object is nothing I am familiar with.It did not behave as one would expect of an aircraft known to our science."],"Region":"Connecticut","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.403432,+-72.10591(26526)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26526) map </A>","Latitude":"41.403432","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Waterford","There were no other sightings in Waterford on or around November 11th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"26526","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Ufo crossed sky and just vanished.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26526.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26526.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"11/11/2010 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-08062011-0049","Longitude":"-72.10591","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 02:34 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Waterford"}
