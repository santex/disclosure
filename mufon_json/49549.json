Then notice just below the star a brilliant white object that looked like a star moving in a steady horizontal path just underneath the stationary star. Watched it thinking it could be a plane, then it stopped and quickly just disappeared, seemingly with a small light streak. Was wondering what I saw when another object just like the first appeared at same position as the first object moved in same path then also quickly disappeared, seemingly leaving the atmosphere, light was just gone."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49549.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49549.html"],"Summary":"saw 2 star like objects mid horizon to the west, straight horizontal path, then seemed to turn and leave atmosphere","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08062013-0031","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.787711,+-119.409272(49549)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49549) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"08/06/2013 08:39 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
