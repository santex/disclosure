Above the Northern mountain, I CONSTANLY see BRIGHT amber colored lights appearing, hovering, moving and disappearing. At least 2-3 a week at various times throughout the evening and early morning. Over the mount charleston, I see white and green lights appear flash, hover and disappear from time to tiime. I can tell it is above for sure because I can see the silhouette of the mt top at times, not only that but sometimes they are so bright that if there are clouds present, they illuminate the entire cloud with its glow! Every time I see them I get goose bumps and chills even though I ve seen them a thousand times. Note: I recently saw a show on crafts in the sky and they are VERY similar to the lights that were seen over the mountains in Phoenix."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"36.119966","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/08/2008 10:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.119966,+-115.165316(12756)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12756) map </A>","Region":"Nevada","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around September 8th 2008"],"City":"Las Vegas","Log Number":"US-09242008-0004","Country":"United States"}
