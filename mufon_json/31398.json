{"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on the deck with my mother and my dog. The object appeared over the NE treeline and seemed to be about the size of an airliner. It's glow was very bright and seemed about the altitude of an airliner. We watched it as it flew overhead and then a secondary brilliant orb flashed in front of it's trajectory and disappeared only for the first object to intersect where the second one had been. An airliner was flying from the north to the south and it intersected the path of the object after it had passed by about 1 minute. It was too low for a satellite and was at least the size and brightness of a high beam headlight on a dark road. It finally disappeared over the far hills having never deviated from its path nor grew brighter or fainter."],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 12:04 UTC","Log Number":"US-09022011-0002","Summary":"Bright object appeared with a secondary one crossing it's path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.440357","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Oregon","City":"Grants Pass","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"31398","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31398.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31398.html"],"Longitude":"-123.326302","Date of the Event":"09/01/2011 08:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Grants Pass","There were no other sightings in Grants Pass on or around September 1st 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.440357,+-123.326302(31398)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31398) map </A>"}
