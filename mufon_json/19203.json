But tonight, just a while ago, my boyfriend and I were outside getting on our motorcycle when we spotted just a single moving star like object just to the north of us headed northeast. It was a dimmer light this time, kind of bluish, no flashes, no sound. Last nights incident gave me a feeling of elation, tonights incident however leaves me feeling moody and unsure.
