We went out to the beach to look at the stars. The visibility was amazing! We looked up and saw a small green and red object. It greatly contrasted with the rest of the stars. I first thought that maybe it was a satellite. It pulsated green and red and when I focused my binoculars on the object it appeared to be moving like a bug trapped in a small jar. It was very far away and thus small. It was hovering in the same spot the entire time. We watched it for about 20 min and than left the beach. The object was still in the sky. I have never seen anything that has ever looked like this object we witnessed sat night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36597.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36597.html"],"Region":"New York","Date Submitted":"03/19/2012 10:23 UTC"}
