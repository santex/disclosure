It was a clear night.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my roof at night and saw a shape that flew past my point of view. facing SE. At first I thought it was an airplane but then it occurred to me that is not the path the planes go on to land at JFK or Lagaurdia airport. Also, no sound! All this happened so quickly but it was moving much much faster than a plane could and much larger. I can understand how size perception can be distorted but I have a good reference on how big planes look and how fast since I am on my roof all the time and live in NYC. I see planes go by all the time. This was very different. I lost sight of the object because other buildings blocked the view for me. All in all it (seemed) about 2 maybe 3 seconds long."],"Latitude":"40.65394","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11172008-0002","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.65394,+-73.94645(13759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13759) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"11/17/2008 12:04 UTC","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around November 17th 2008"],"Case Number":"13759","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
