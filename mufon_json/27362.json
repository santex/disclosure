It had a short tail that was also red - orange looking much like a flame. The tail appeared to be moving back and fourth quickly almost like a fish swimming. It seemed to be going in a straight line, due North. I do not believe it was a meteor as it seemed to be travelling much more slowly; about the speed of an airplane. I heard no sound from it at all. It took probably a minute or a little less to cross the sky and disappear behind the tree line.
