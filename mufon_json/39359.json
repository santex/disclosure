Took another and another as the object moved away, picking up some speed. Downloaded the pictures onto the desktop and found only one picture came out clear enough to see (a cigar shaped object) When you first look at the dark night sky, you don't see anything. But scroll into the picture making it larger and it looks like a bright white cigar object."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
