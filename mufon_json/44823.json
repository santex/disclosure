{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving to work at about 7am going east on highway 90, 3 miles west of 36th ST (near Kelly Field). When I witnessed a large boomerang shaped object flying slowly at about 500ft traveling northwest in a straight line. The object had multiple randomly flashing lights on its exterior. I witnessed the event for about 30 seconds before it crossed the highway and went out of view. What caught my attention was the strange pattern of lights on its surface, and that it seemed to be going extremely slow for how large the object was. The object made no noise and did'nt exhibit any patterns of a normal man-made aircraft (I am an Avionics Technician and work on aircraft for a living and am well familiar with standard aircraft position and landing lights)."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"44823","Log Number":"US-12282012-0005","Date of the Event":"12/28/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around December 28th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.430122,+-98.484028(44823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44823) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/28/2012 09:33 UTC","City":"San Antonio","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44823.html"],"Summary":"Witnessed a large, boomerang shaped object flying slowly at about 500ft with multiple flashing lights on its surface.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"29.430122","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Longitude":"-98.484028","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
