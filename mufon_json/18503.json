I stepped outside and looked up as the sky was clear and dark, not semi-cloudy as usual. I was looking at the constellations when I noticed a moving light coming from the north, and it stayed in my sight as it continued in a straight line at a high altitude across the heavens and gradually disappeared from view, toward the south. I immediately thought it was a satellite, as I had seen one at that time of day several years ago, and reported it, either here, or Nuforc. But then while I was thinking about that, another one came right behind it, following the same path. No sound. The size appeared like a planet, maybe, and the warm color seemed more glowing than flashing. There were also a couple of meteorites, which appeared white and fell downward and disappeared. All that in the space of under five minutes. Then I got tired of having my neck bent backward looking up, so I went in the house."],"Latitude":"19.621111","Summary":"Two reddish round balls flew across the sky.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Keaau","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Keaau","There were no other sightings in Keaau on or around August 3rd 2009"],"Case Number":"18503","Longitude":"-155.041667","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18503.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18503.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.621111,+-155.041667(18503)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18503) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/03/2009 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
