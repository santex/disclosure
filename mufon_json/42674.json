I thought to myself \"look how big that star is\". Just as I merged onto the highway I noticed a second star further down from the first one but smaller. I then thought to myself \"oh I wonder if these are planets\". The stars were an orange color. As I continued to drive I saw smaller white round lights that \"speckled\" randomly around and between the two orange \"stars\". As I continued going southbound the lights were starting to be to my left peripheral view and that's when I saw rotating blue, white, orange lights. These lights rotated at least three times and I saw it slightly ascend at least three times. That's when I pulled over to see this object carefully when I noticed that it was gone. I looked at the time and it was exactly 10:37pm."],"Date Submitted":"09/20/2012 12:23 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
