I noticed a solid bright starlike object moving from the north north west direction. I listened to see if there was any noise and there was none. I continued to watch it and it hesitated twice at a slower speed and then changed direction about 90��� heading due east. As it moved in that direction it slowly dimmed until it was no longer visible."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29816.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/30/2011 11:18 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-06302011-0025","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"29816","Latitude":"34.736194","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/30/2011 09:55 UTC","Summary":"No sound","Region":"Tennessee","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.736194,+-86.624076(29816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29816) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.624076"}
