I stood there watching it for 15-20 minute thinking to myself, come on prove to that me you're real aliens. Thats when i saw something with 3 lights on it flying towards me. My first instinct was to run, but i stood there and watched it. I honestly thought i was about to die right there. As i was standing there, this object flew right above my head and made no noise until it was directly above me. It made the craziest roaring, low-toned humming sound. It flew off towards the north, i raced inside to grab my girlfriend before it left but it was too late. The other object was still there in the sky. I'm hoping what i experienced happened to someone else. This was honestly one of the most intense moments in my life."],"Date Submitted":"01/16/2013 04:05 UTC","Longitude":"-111.784282","Object Features":"Wings, Unknown","City":"Mesa","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45249.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45249.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01162013-0013","Summary":"3 lights going over my apartment flying directly above me very low to the ground.","Case Number":"45249"}
