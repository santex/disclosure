{"Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["sighting detailsmy husband and i were out on the back deck. there was weird looking clouds in the sky and we were trying to figure out if it was from a jet or the clouds. they looked like stripes. this was about 1\\2 an hour before we spotted what looked like a star in the sky. there were not many stars out, but one in particular was doing a zig zag motion. it would go very fast to the right and then the left. it was high enough in the sky to really look like the surrounding stars only this one moved. at one point it looked like a orange color coming from the back of it. we watched for an hour or so without explanation other than a ufo. we went in the house for awhile and before retiring for bed, i went out to see if it was still there. i couldn't locate it at first, but then in the same area this thing shot real quick from the right and hovered in the same area. last year we had an experience in the same area but this craft was huge and hovered with circular lights. we thought if it would land it would take up atleast four blocks of our area. we kept everything to ourselves until now. it seems to have activity in the same area which is over the bay."],"Date Submitted":"08/15/2007 08:46 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-76.633211","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Maryland","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7690.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7690.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08162007-0004","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/15/2007 08:46 UTC","Case Number":"7690","Latitude":"39.049835","Summary":"Looked like a star","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.049835,+-76.633211(7690)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7690) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed"}
