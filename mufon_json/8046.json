The narrative that follows is from a law officer's report obtained by the writer and was verbally communicated to me via telephone. Members of MUFON (state not specified) contacted Washington County about 10:15 PM on Sept. 24, 2007 to find out if there had been any sightings of unidentified flying objects in the skies over Washington County at around 10:15PM on Monday Sept. 24, 2007. An orb-like object was reportedly seen by a home owner in Hudson, Wisconsin five nights in a row. The witness (female) said that the light was flashing very fast, was bright, and hovered in the same spot at the Minnesota - Wisconsin border for what seemed like fifteen to twenty minutes - joined by a similar light."]}
