It then made a noise and I remember feeling excited but also a little horny. It was very odd, I realized I had an erection that was from the excitment. When I looked down the triangle had left in a quick flash of light. My cell phone stopped working. I went home and started having lots of pain in my lower stomach area. Today I have pains in my head, like a head ache but much more worse. I think they are trying to communicate with me."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.041486,+-74.129032(10070)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10070) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10070.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10070.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/20/2008 11:25 UTC","City":"Allendale","Log Number":"US-03272008-0012","Case Number":"10070","Date Submitted":"03/20/2008 11:25 UTC"}
