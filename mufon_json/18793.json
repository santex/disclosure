Suddenly just above the Northern Horizon, movement caught my eye. I turned my attention to right above the Horizon, as I watched an Illuminated Sky-Blue Solid Colored Disc move from the Northern Horizon to the Southern Horizon in about 10 seconds, fading away as it approached the Southern Horizon. It appeared to be about the size of a frisbee, if one were to hold a frisbee at arms length away from ones' face. It seemed like it may have been traveling in the upper atmosphere, in which case it would have been rather large. It made no noise, just the lighted solid sky-blue color over the entire disc."],"Log Number":"IQ-08212009-0015","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ninawa","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18793","Latitude":"36.336571","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.336571,+43.139091(18793)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18793) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","City":"Mosul","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mosul","There were no other sightings in Mosul on or around June 1st 2003"],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Solid Sky-Blue Oval Disc","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/01/2003 11:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Iraq","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18793.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18793.html"],"Longitude":"43.139091"}
