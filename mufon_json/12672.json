The shape of the object was difficult to discern but it was moving very slowly and would grow dimmer and brighter. As I watched, two jet planes ( I do not know if they were commercial or military)approached the object, from the east, one seeminly \"above\" and the other \"below\" the object. At that point the object seemed to stop altogether for several seconds and there was also a private plane that was flying much lower, which I observed,also approaching from the east, which I guessed was the source of the plane engine noise I was hearing. As soon as all three planes were well past the object,it began to move toward the north and disappeared behind some tall trees. I remember trying to figure out what it might be and not coming up with anything that made sense."],"Latitude":"39.554801","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/20/2008 10:15 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12672.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12672.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"12672","Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/20/2008 10:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
