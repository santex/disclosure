{"Region":"Utah","Summary":"Orange Sphere seen traveling over Northern part of Salt Lake City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out sky watching. I came out to observer the sky at 10:10 pm. I use 10x50 binoculars mounted on a tripod. At 10:21 pm I see a light colored orange sphere. The orange sphere was traveling over the northern part of Salt Lake City. It was heading in a northeastern direction. It turned slightly north as it was leaving the valley area. It made this slight turn as it was going over the mountain ranges north north east of down town Salt lake City. It was about 25 degrees above the horizon.....(calculating that 90 degrees is straight up) The object was at about 6,000 feet(AGL). I could hear no sound from it. It was moving at a constant speed, a little faster than most aircraft. It was a solid unwavering lit object....kind of a glow...light orange in color. It had no FFA marker lights. It had no blinking lights at all. The whole object glowed and was round in shape. I watched it with Binoculars for about a minute. I lost view of it on amount of distance and atmospheric conditions."],"Log Number":"US-07192012-0003","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"40918","Latitude":"40.695114","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.695114,+-111.97529(40918)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40918) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Longitude":"-111.97529","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40918.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40918.html"],"trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There were 2 other sightings in Salt Lake City on or around July 18th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"07/18/2012 10:21 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"07/19/2012 12:55 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Salt Lake City"}
