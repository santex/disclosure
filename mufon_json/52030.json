It actually may be on top of Monte Sano mountain where I am residing. I have not noticed this situation before and the trajectory of the light gives the indication that it may be coming from the top of the mountain which has not been home to such a light before. I didn't want to use the 'Mufon Sighting Report' to report this with, so could you please direct me to someone who may live in this area that knows what may be happening here? It occurred Sunday evening, November 3rd, at approximately 6:15 - 8:00pm. Thank you for your time and hopefully this turns out to be nothing at all to be alarmed about."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11042013-0012","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Huntsville","There were no other sightings in Huntsville on or around November 3rd 2013"],"Date Submitted":"11/04/2013 02:39 UTC"}
