We were in the process of cleaning up the car. When all of a sudden our son Noah shouts; UFO's! UFO's in the sky! I thought he was kidding since I have told them the story of what had happened the previous week. As I head straight to back yard, I look at the sky and saw five lights flying. As they did before they were flying form the North East going to South East section of the sky. At this time the distance from the house was eastern from the previous week. I asked my son to bring me the video camera and started recording them."],"City":"Oregon City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Oregon City","There were no other sightings in Oregon City on or around August 22nd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Longitude":"-122.601638","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
