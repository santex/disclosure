Thought at first it was a blimp or advertisement balloon for a car dealership. As we got closer we saw that it had three \"legs\" extended outward as if they were landing gear of some sort. We pulled into a parking lot and I noticed many other people standing around staring at it. My co worker entered the store and I began speaking with a woman that was also witnessing this \"Orb\". As I spoke with her she said, \"Oh my god\". I looked back and it was gone! She said it vanished. It didn't go up, down, east, west... it just vanished. It looked like a very large, small building size, pinball in the sky. All metallic reflecting the sky and sun."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.16541,+-77.603912(39377)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39377) map </A>","trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around June 15th 2012"]}
