At first when I saw them, I thought Venus or whatever, but never heard of another thing as bright shining in the sky, so I kept my focus on them. They could have been there or thereabouts much longer, but from the time I saw them....it lasted about 15-20 seconds of them staying still til one of them just taking off at a speed I never thought possible (up and to the south) as an example, it went from a pea sized bright light to a grain of fine sand in less than a second. The other one stayed for a second longer and then flew off in the same manner. There were no storms in the area, it was a clear sky......no explanation that I can think of??"],"Summary":"Saw two bright objects close to each other in the southern sky.
