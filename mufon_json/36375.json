I went outside to see how close it was because it was extremely loud. I looked up into the sky and within a few seconds I saw four blue lights in an arc pattern followed by a helicopter. The blue lights stayed in the same shape the whole time it was in view which lasted approx. 5 seconds. I lost sight of the helicopter and blue lights because of trees. It appeared to me that the helicopter was chasing the lights."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
