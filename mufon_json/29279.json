We thought nothing off it, and then noticed several planes, shooting stars, etc. Actually, we thought it could have been a satelite at first, but realized a satelite could not be stationary, then begin to move. Next, we all noticed another one and began to watch for more. We saw at least six or seven of the same type object. The last one we saw began to slowly move as all the others did, then it dissapeared, and reappeared a hands length to the right, and dissapeared again. We then immediatly decided we should report the sighting."],"Summary":"Series of small, pin-shaped objects slowly moving across the night sky.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.566957,+-89.638767(29279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29279) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-89.638767","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/27/2011 10:30 UTC","City":"Covington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05282011-0001","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Tennessee","Date Submitted":"05/28/2011 12:38 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29279.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29279.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"35.566957"}
