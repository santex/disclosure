Discounting aircraft,having worked on the flight-line for 20 yrs. lights of this color and brightness dont just appear on a clear night with out some sort of an approach.These 2 lights ejected 4 smaller ones to the left and down. Something similar to a Citation 5 in a right bank. This lasted 4-5 secs.then vanished.I scanned a couple seconds and these lights reappeared in the same line fashion for a couple more seconds,then vanished.I know this is something I will forever remember. And, I have faith in the believers."],"Date of the Event":"11/14/2011 05:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34216.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34216.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.981136,+-90.502461(34216)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34216) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12192011-0013","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Tomah","There were no other sightings in Tomah on or around November 14th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"12/19/2011 09:16 UTC","Longitude":"-90.502461"}
