I thought it was like a special bird. So I kept on looking and I saw that it wasn't flying but streaking throught the air like an airplane. I saw a small flash for a second. So I wondered what it was. I lost sight of the object when it when behind a large tree. I tried to find it again but it was hopeless. I told everybody what I saw, but nobody believed me."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.872414","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12581.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12581.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.988968","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
