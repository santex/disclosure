As I was doing this I observed, just after sirious(?), a star appeared in the void that is following the constellation, shown like a star, then doubled in size and disappeared. The only thing I could think of is that I saw a supernova. Then I asked myself; with the naked eye? I know I'm not the only one who saw this. I know what I saw, and if anyone wants to talk to me about it would be much appreciated."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.605826,+-81.169982(38070)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38070) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.169982","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Virginia","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"05/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05112012-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"star, doubled in size, then disappeared.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Independence","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"38070","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38070.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/11/2012 01:53 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
