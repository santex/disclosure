She was trying to make a phone call and her phone would not work. So I went in to get my phone. As soon as I walked into the house I could hear her mumbling my name over and over. I ran out and saw she was looking up. As I looked up I saw a round, dull glow, flying towards the north. As I looked at it, it felt like my eyes were being pulled away from it. So I stopped looking as I was going to lose sight anyways cause of the house. I then turned to my girlfriend, and asked her if she was okay? When my girlfriend was looking at it and mumbling my name. She said it did something to her eyes, like it didn't want her to focus on it. But she had no fear. I am used to these events and I don't fear much. But when I could not focus on it I felt something."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around October 6th 2012"],"Latitude":"29.399899","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Case Number":"43121","Longitude":"-98.542883","Log Number":"US-10092012-0014","City":"San Antonio"}
