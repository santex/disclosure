One day I was in a hunting blind just a few minutes after the sun set, and suddenly 3 white lights appear in the horizon(US side) I thought it may be 3 USA aircraft, but they didn���t move for at least 10 minutes, I could se a border patrol Zeppelin near by (that they use for detecting aircraft coming illegally from the Mexican side) as time passed it became dark I was getting uncomfortable as the 3 light didn���t move or produced any sound, suddenly form the lights start coming out a lot of lights (blue and red) flying in different patterns, I thought they had been helicopters but the pattern and speed of movement was much faster a human aircraft can do it, they flew for around 20 minutes (but no one of the light crossed the border to Mexico), and then they disappeared, I went back to camp and check the map of the area, in the us side it was a restricted area, so I believe the UFOs that I saw where a kind of experiment of the US military. my exact location was latitude 28��� 8'10.39\"N longitud 100��� 7'31.31\"O"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"24882","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Eagle Pass","Longitude":"-100.493631","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24882.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24882.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Circle, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.711963,+-100.493631(24882)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24882) map </A>","Latitude":"28.711963","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"3 lights dropping 20 smaller UFOs red& blue flying in different patterns."}
