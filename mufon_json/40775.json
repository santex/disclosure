Stars were becoming visible in much of the sky. We were turned towards the east and saw a large orange ball rise over the tree lines. It pulsated. It had no additional lights. It was just a large circle, much larger, brighter, more orange than any traditional aircraft. We killed the boats engine to listen and it was silent. It crossed south to north in front of us and every adult on the boat was confused by it's lack of identifying lights, shapes or sounds. It went fairly slow for something that seemed lower, like the height of a helicopter. The light appeared to grow brighter ad then weaker. Then it disappeared right in the middle of the sky. Like someone turned the light out. It flickered out. Entire duration 3 to 4 minutes. It was too close and too big to be silent."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.114528,+-71.099784(40775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40775) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/13/2012 11:33 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nottingham","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
