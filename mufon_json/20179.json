Then I went to terrace of my home and observed the object. It was about 5 Km away from us. The object was like a missile moving from West to the North-West(Left to Right) slowly at height of 5 degree visualy. The color of whole object was orange. My friend said that it was about 6-8 degree long visualy at starting and it was getting short, when I show it(after 2 minutes), it was about 2 arc degree long visualy. There is an airport at North-West from my home, But I don't think that it was any aeroplane. 5 persons(with me) wathed that object. That object was slowly disapearing and then totaly disapeared in sky. Ramesh has watched this event for about 4 minutes."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
