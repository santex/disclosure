Right after the sun went down, the underside of the cloud cover lit up with an orange glow. It was beautiful. I snapped 5 photos in a row. When I got home, i downloaded the photos in my computer and was surprised to see a disc like object in the second to last photo. It does not appear in any of the other photos. I just had my sensor cleaned so my photos are not impaired by dust or other particles. I did NOT photoshop, saturate, or alter this photo in any way. The only thing I did was straighten the horizon a little. The image is grainy because the ISO was set at 1600 to eliminate blur. I have no explanation for the object in the upper right corner of the photo.
