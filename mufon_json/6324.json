There was 4 of us, a couple of years ago, sitting out at a lake in Moe, in country Victoria, there was no moon and the sky was bright with stars, it was our summertime. I was relaying my ufo foo light story to them when my friend said \"well what's that then?\" and pointed to the stars! I saw what he was seeing immediately, it was a star moving!!!! It glided through space from one star to another and in a very decisive fashion, it knew where it was going, it visited about 5 or 6 of them, we saw it quite clearly travel through space to each one of them!!!!, and then it went just went into deeper space, gone from our view!!!! We were stunned to say the least!!! Did that occur millions of years ago for us to see it now? And I believe that the Pleiades is visible from our southern skies but I really cant say what constellation we were looking at., we were looking toward our west that's all I can say."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"-38.174755","Date Submitted":"02/15/2002 09:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"02/15/2002 09:30 UTC","City":"Moe","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6324.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6324.html"],"Tags":"City"}
