The way the full moon was casting shadows, there wasn't a cloud in in the sky. The shadows disappeared I looked toward the moon to check out and there it was tree top high above our house. I was in the drive-way. Not even 50 ft from house. I got out of car went to the door opened it but did not go inside hollered for my mom to come look. We both stood there looking straight up at it not a noise, then the light came on ( we lived in an old 1 room school house) the trees were full grown maple trees. Light were circular and were red and white. Then it started moving real slow got out away from house and shot straight up and disappeared"],"Date Submitted":"11/07/2013 07:38 UTC","Longitude":"-85.902546","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"08/30/1971 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-11072013-0018","Summary":"Was a clear night with full moon, I looked up and there it was above our house tree top high","Latitude":"42.79369","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.79369,+-85.902546(52092)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52092) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
