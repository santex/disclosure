Everyone was sleeping, unless a neighbor who was up all night. In the window he saw the object in the sky and called us at home, went to see her mom, my mom and me. I do not believe in such things until I peeked in the window and see something like a fly white, very white, without lights, their movements were like those of an insect flying around a light bulb. We were seeing the phenomenon almost an hour until everyone went to bed. My first reaction was a sort of experiment in the U.S. about Venezuela, I refused to believe it was a UFO. Please, I want an explanation, contact me, thank you. I do not know who to believe me, nobody believed me the other day, I was ashamed to continue counting, thinking he was crazy. I regret not having a video camera to record or take pictures. I swear to God, for my ancestry than I described here is the truth and nothing but the truth."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/17/2010 11:26 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cumana","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"VE-02172010-0013","Date of the Event":"08/14/2009 04:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Strange thing in the sky of Cumana at 4:00 am","Longitude":"-64.1675","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=10.456389,+-64.1675(21922)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21922) map </A>","City":"Cumana"}
