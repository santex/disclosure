Me and my son looked up to see what appeared to be a standard jet(noise no prop) flying over at a fast rate of speed and what appeared to be a black nonlit object roughly 50 feet in front of it . The circular object with some kind of shaped appendages sticking off the sides made absolutley no noise and had no visible afterburners or glowing fuel source as it flew ahead of the jet as if being chased. I watched the jet fly off in the distance and never noticed anything else that night. The Jet and the object it was chasing flew off in a Northern direction. I can honestly say on my grandmother and sisters grave i know what i saw and it has forever changed my life"],"City":"Jermyn","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.530915,+-75.545463(32940)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32940) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/29/2011 01:43 UTC","Summary":"me and son noticed a military type jet with lights trailing a dark nolit fast moving abject within 50 feet of it overhead","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"41.530915","Case Number":"32940","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON"}
