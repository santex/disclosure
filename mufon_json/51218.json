Looking over the ocean one light orb appears and hovers before joined by another similar orb just directly above and to the south. These two light orbs looked as big as a penny, maybe a little larger from where we were on the beach. They somewhat pulsated, like fire, but were perfect circles and hovered, not changing shape or size. After hovering for about 10 minutes, the orbs seemed to sink towards the ocean ever so slowly, and then move back up to their original spot. After a few minutes, they seemed to disperse as if perhaps traveling east away from the beach, over the ocean more until they disappeared. A week later, talked to a neighbor who described the same thing from the beach just a mile south of where we were. In the picture attached, the moon is the obvious light on the right hand side. The two smaller lights are the orbs we witnessed."],"Log Number":"US-09302013-0025","Date of the Event":"09/19/2013 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Melbourne Beach","There were no other sightings in Melbourne Beach on or around September 19th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-80.55249","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.07398","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51218.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51218.html"],"Region":"Florida"}
