When I looked up, it was probably magnitude -6 or -7, and was just west of a line between the star Alkaid in Ursa Major and Arcturus in Bootes. It seemed to move slightly east and then turned to the south, it hadn't traveled much more than 20 degrees before it had faded so much that I couldn't see it anymore. Limiting magnitude that night was about +4.5, due to light pollution from Topeka. My wife was facing the wrong direction to see it after it had faded, and didn't look up in time when it was bright."],"Summary":"extremely bright light directly overhead, changed direction and rapidly faded.","Object Features":"None","Region":"Kansas","Date of the Event":"05/21/2012 09:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/28/2012 07:06 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"38595","Source":"MUFON"}
