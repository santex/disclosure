(i.e. looking up in the right place at the right time for a few seconds) i feel excited and highly enthusiastic about witnessing\\learning about my, and other people's sightings or experiences."],"trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There was one other sighting in San Diego on or around April 8th 2008"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.154955","Latitude":"32.720929","Date Submitted":"04/08/2008 09:00 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"San Diego","Case Number":"10215","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/08/2008 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-04092008-0003","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"2 disc-like objects where flying in formation","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.720929,+-117.154955(10215)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10215) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
