I looked out of the hotel Window in the 4th floor and saw an Object hovering in the Sky beside of a condominium Building.The object was spinning around while completely still hovering maybe around 100 meter high.It moved after several minutes slowly to the right,then stopped again and moved slowly to the left and flies behind the building.It crossed the whole building and came out on the left side of the building.Then it was flying staight and slow out of our sight.In the pictures and the video it seems not to spin,but when we looked at it while taking pictures its clear to see that it spins around.We are sure,that no Plane,Balloon or Helicopter was at that time in that area. We were totally exited during and after the event and knew,that it was not normal.We all think that its really a ufo.I hope that our video and the pics can help you to find out more.You can contact us anytime for further Information.We have still more pictures (26 in all) Thank you, M.M."],"Log Number":"PH-07252011-0004","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Manila","There were no other sightings in Manila on or around June 27th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30339.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30339_submitter_file2__IMG_2184.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30339_submitter_file3__IMGP0135.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30339.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Diamond, Oval, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"30339","Longitude":"120.98878","Summary":"The Object spins around,moving slowly from left to right and back.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"14.602382","Date Submitted":"07/25/2011 01:50 UTC"}
