We were looking at the city skyline when I noticed a bright orange light in the sky. At first I thought that it was Mars because the positioning was right but it was far too bright.The object then disappeared before my girlfriend saw it. Seconds later it reappeared, brighter than before, and this time she saw it as well. Then it faded and grew brighter again, so bright that it was almost blinding, then it rose in the air and started moving to the left fading as it did so. Then it stopped abruptly, faded from view, and became the blinding orange light that it had been before. It started moving to the right extremely quickly, and as it was moving, it started fading then blinking. It then disappeared from sight altogether. The incident altogether was about 10 minutes."],"Summary":"An extremely bright light in the sky which pulsed and faded then disappeared.","Date of the Event":"11/09/2011 07:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.573904,+34.951979(33231)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33231) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33231.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33231.html"],"Log Number":"IL-11092011-0011","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"11/09/2011 12:44 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Hefa","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Latitude":"32.573904","Tags":"City"}
