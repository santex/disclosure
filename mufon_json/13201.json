{"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI just got home from work around 7pm. I was walking through the backyard to let the dog out of the pen. It had just gotten dark at this time of year. The lights were very noticable. They were in a boomerang shape, low to the treeline and making no noise. The dogs did not even bark which I thought was also odd. The object hovered and moved at a slow rate of speed. It returned from the same direction that it came from. I felt like it was observing me. This event really scared me and I felt scared for my life. The object was enormous. I couldnt see an outline of the object but if the lights were attached to one object then it had to be larger than a football field."],"Longitude":"-79.01732","Latitude":"35.762643","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/22/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Log Number":"US-10242008-0004","Summary":"Boomerang shaped lights hovering and blinking low to the ground, BIG","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"13201","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13201.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/22/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"North Carolina","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.762643,+-79.01732(13201)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13201) map </A>"}
