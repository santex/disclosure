{"Date of the Event":"07/15/2007 07:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was working at my job and trying to fix a broken garage door. my co-worker stood on a ladder as i stood at the bottom of the ladder to keep it steady. i was watching what he was doing with my head pointed upward to the sky. in my peripheral vision as i was looking up i spotted a dark circular object in the sky. this object was moving about as fast as an airplane flies. i saw no wings and one flashing red light with an interval of about two seconds between flashes. the object wobbled in a way that is hard to describe in words. after about twenty seconds of us wathing this scene it went behind and above a huge puffy cumulous cloud. we did not see it emerge from the other side of the cloud. it was dusk and partly cloudy but clear skys and good visability made the object very clear and easy to see. the object appeared in a south westerly direction and moved in a straight line west of the initial sighting spot. i was confused about the object because i have never seen an aircraft flying over philadelphia that had no wings and wobbled that way. my initial thought right away was that it may be a weather balloon but it was perfectly circular. my co-worker and i agreed after comparing what we saw that it was not anything that we could identify and highly unusual in the middle of the city ."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"41.211332","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/15/2007 07:30 UTC","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8425.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8425.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.211332,+-77.188615(8425)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8425) map </A>","Case Number":"8425","Summary":"saw a dark circular object with one red light for 20 seconds","Longitude":"-77.188615","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-11222007-0002","Tags":"City"}
