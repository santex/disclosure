It moved rather gracefully, NO sound, NO anti-collision lights of any type. I called my wife out to see it and as she came out of the house the object made a smooth curve turn towards the east, then it turned again smoothing towards the south. We both stared at it for a couple of seconds till it dissappeared or better yet dimmed out. There is no way it would have dimmed out so quickly. It would have been visible for another minute or so since it was brighter than any object in the sky including the visible planets to the east and west and any star in Orions Constellation at the moment. This thing was huge in brightness. Yellowish in appearance. Just dimmed out as it moved south."],"Latitude":"25.910347","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01242010-0020","Date Submitted":"01/24/2010 08:41 UTC","Case Number":"21627","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Brownsville","There was one other sighting in Brownsville on or around January 24th 2010"]}
