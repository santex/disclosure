She was facing east and shouted \"what the hell is that\". I turned around and saw a bright orange object high in the sky traveling north. It stopped due east of our location. Certainly bigger than a starlight. It was about the same tint as an incandescent street lamp. It seemed to wiggle and waver before my friend remarked that it looked like it was flying away directly away from us. I noticed the same as it completely disappeared from view."]}
