As I was driving to work I would occasionally glance over and could still see it. Once I got to work I could no longer see it due to Parking Lot Lights."],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Log Number":"US-09172013-0004","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Oregon","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Harbor","Date of the Event":"09/15/2013 02:25 UTC","Case Number":"50874","Latitude":"42.047911","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50874.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50874.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.047911,+-124.260808(50874)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50874) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/17/2013 09:55 UTC"}
