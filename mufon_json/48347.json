When we reached the Bristol Wharf, along the Delaware River, Wes and I decided to take a break. We sat on a park bench overlooking the Delaware river toward Burlington Island. At first, we saw nothing. Then after a few minutes, we noticed an orange ball of light slowly fade on. The ball of light remained in place for between 20 and 30 seconds before slowly fading out and disappearing. Then, it would slowly fade back on, but be above a different part of the island. We saw between 3 and four, but never at the same time. Wes and I watched this until we just got bored of it, and left."],"City":"Glenside","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48347.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48347.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.101861,+-75.161245(48347)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48347) map </A>","Longitude":"-75.161245","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
