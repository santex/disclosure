I knew it was not man made when I saw the rate of speed it was traveling. It was not a meteor as ther was no trail of light following it. The craft was visable above the horizon at about 40 to 45 degrees and dissapeared behind the horizon. It was only visable for about 4 seconds. The Square shape of the object and white floresecnt glow is what made this craft so unique."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.968516","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.997494","Region":"Ohio","Country":"United States"}
