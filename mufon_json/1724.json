Shortly after the disk disappeared a plane (jet)came into view. What I saw previously bore no resemblance to a plane from anyangle. What struck me the most was how it was there and then poof, gone. Thedisk appeared to move slower than any planes that are normally in the area. Itwas too far and too bright to see any details. I had Polaroid Sunglasses on atthe time. I know this is rather vague but I thought if someone else reports asighting this would lend credibility to it."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"1724","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1724.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1724.html"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"North Brunswick","Summary":"Disk Sighted in Somerset, NJ","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"06/17/2002 10:00 UTC"}
