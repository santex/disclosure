At first, I was thinking it was a star because it was not moving, but I noticed that this was 3 lights together. I could see for approximately 5 minutes, then it simply disappeared without movement or sound. It was not an airplane. I can say because I worked 5 years in a airport when I was in the Air Force."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07312009-0012","Object Shape":"Other","Source":"MUFON"}
