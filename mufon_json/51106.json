My wife let our dog out. As he was doing his \"duty\" I was watching the sky. After less than 5 minutes, I saw a meteor from N to S. After another 2 to 3 minutes, I saw what appeared to be 8-10 triangles flying as though connected. They reminded me of a reticulated plastic toy snake, slightly weaving through the sky. The entire event lasted possibly 20 seconds. They were silent, dark red, and were flying faster than a satellite or an airplane would normally fly across the sky. The entire \"string\" of objects were significantly longer than an airplane. They had no flashing lights. The object(s) faded from view as it headed farther to the horizon."],"Date of the Event":"09/26/2012 08:50 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-09262013-0016","Date Submitted":"09/26/2013 09:17 UTC","Longitude":"-82.082135","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","City":"Port Charlotte","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"appeared like a plastic toy reticulated snake","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
