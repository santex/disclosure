If you lived in this are you would know that the storm converged right over our heads. The winds were wild and amazing in their force and frequency. After it was all said and done we emerge to shovel, plow, and digg our ways out of our homes. There was one amazing thing on that day, something i had not noticed before. Those that live in the country would know exactly what i mean. It was quite. No car sounds, no distant truck, and most importantly NO PLANES. It is at this time that I stared at the sky as the clouds began to break, to my surprise there was this long chem trail in the air you know the stuff planes leave behind when they fly by. But remmber New England airports were sill closed because of the storm just less than 10 hours Before. I now present the evidence and a question. What caused that and other chem trails that appeared over the skies on that day?"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"45649","Latitude":"41.854458","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/10/2013 11:29 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
