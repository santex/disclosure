I immediately went outside to look at it better and while I was staring at it the light seemed to change colors, like through a prism. The light was in no order but I remember red, green, yellow-ish white, and yellow. I live near an airport and I know the colors the lights are on the planes and I know what they look like. After a while staring at it I went to get my phone to get a picture but there was too much light pollution from the church next door to see it in the phone image. I stood there staring at it and it didn't seem to be moving then it looked further away, the light had become smaller to my vision, and it went right to left and up then down then back to the original position. My dad came out and said it was a plane up high but planes don't move like that, well they don't move that fast if they're that far away. I lost sight of it by coming in here to submit this."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
