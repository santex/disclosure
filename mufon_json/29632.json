Anyway, I was with a friend outside my back yard kind of talking about the kinds of sightings I experienced when at exactly 1:13am a star appeared in the northwestern sky and moved somewhat quickly to the east and before it went into a constellation it got brighter and then disappeared. After seeing so many sighting all my life I recognized it as my celestial friends.
