I get up most clear mornings and go out to observe the sky. Some times with binoculars and sometime with out. While observing the Orion nebula I saw a fast moving light moving from below the Orion constellation in an upward direction. Another light of about the same brightness came in at about a 30 degree angle and seemed to join the first. There was no flash of an explosion and the lights became one. I thought one pass the other but this did not happen. When the lights reached each other one disappeared and the other continued until it faded out. I have seen the space station and other satellites but they never moved in the trajectory these two objects did. We live below a major air coridor with many aircraft passing over each night (and day). I can not even guess at the altitude. The magnitude (brightness) was about the same as the average star around the Orion constellation. This was a naked eye observation."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.744319,+-122.628581(19843)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19843) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.628581","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
