The level they dropped off to seemed to be maybe one to two miles up off the ground and I watched them till they were no longer visible to my eye. Their speed seemed to be flying faster than a normal aircraft would fly at that altitude. I see airplanes fly in and out of the Beaverton and PDX airports every day. At first they looked like orbs but as they swooped down then leveling off they looked more flat disc like and glowing extremely bright. This all lasted about 6-7 seconds?."],"City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.810363","Object Flight Path":"Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-07192009-0018","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/19/2009 01:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.810363,+-120.550081(18180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18180) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-120.550081","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18180.html"]}
