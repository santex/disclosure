{"divs":["Sighting DetailsFor the past 4 nights, I have seen these star-like objects in the night, they come out anywhere from 9PM-1AM. There are some that reappear in the same places as the previous night, but each night there are more. When I say same places, I mean that it predominantly where they are, but one thing is for sure. They move in U shaped and figure 8 turns, and some even stobe into blue, or red. I have been trying my hardest to find an explanation, but I'm still mystified. I even called the police out, and they have no explanation. Lockheed Martin is not even a half hour away, and they test special aircraft designed for the military. I sure would appreciate any thoughts on this, as it has been a big question for me."],"Region":"Georgia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19684.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19684.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-84.61184","Tags":"City","City":"Kennesaw","Log Number":"US-09272009-0019","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"09/27/2009 08:53 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/27/2009 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"34.025774","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Kennesaw","There were no other sightings in Kennesaw on or around September 27th 2009"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Bright lights that zig-zag and move in circles, slowly.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.025774,+-84.61184(19684)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19684) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Case Number":"19684","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
