It stopped above our neighborhood and split into five similar balls in a triangle formation. We then got his brother and went outside. The orbs rotated to face east and then moved off into the distance and out of sight. We all were a little shaken by what we saw but non of us were freaking out. We then contacted a friend who lived close by and he saw the same exact thing and was able to get a picture."],"Longitude":"-88.191322","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Plainfield","There were no other sightings in Plainfield on or around May 12th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Date of the Event":"05/12/2013 01:29 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/12/2013 03:22 UTC","Log Number":"US-05122013-0004","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
