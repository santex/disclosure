The observed it for about one minute coming towards me and then it began to fade slowly and disappeared completely. I continued to watch to see if it would pass over because I thought it might have been landing lights on a plane. I never heard or saw anything pass over. This was between 8:30 pm and 9:00 pm in the evening. I dont know what it was but it seemed odd because of the clear skies not to see it if it had any type of lighting like on aircraft."]}
