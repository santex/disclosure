I tried to ignore the sound until several minutes had passed and it still had not subsided. I decided to investigate and went out on my 2nd floor balcony, which faces northwest, only to find nothing within my viewing range and the sound fading to nothing. Directly across from my balcony is another condo complex, approximately 75-100 feet away. The two run parallel and there is a long grassy lane that runs between them. I have a good view of the northwest sky and an extremely bright star (I���m not sure what it���s called, but it isn���t the north star because it moves beyond my viewing area late at night.) I decided to smoke a cigarette while I was outside, and after several minutes I could see two objects in the distance, which I thought were planes because I could see red and white lights. I continued to smoke until I noticed that the lights were closer and appeared to be much lower in the sky than I originally thought. I watched the lights move toward me, to the south, and when the closest one broke the plane of the twilight I could see a silhouette of a black sphere shape with 4-5 lights on it. I did not hear any sound or see any headlights or green lights, and I my adrenaline was pumping as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing. I live near SFO Airport, so planes are regularly flying overhead. I then noticed that the second set of lights also appeared to be on a sphere shaped craft and both craft were flying in the same direction at aproximately the same altitude. I watched as both craft appeared to fly in a straight line due south until they passed out of my view. As I lit up another cigarette, I reflected on what had occurred and attempted to logically explain what I had seen. Not even two minutes later, something else caught my eye further north. A triangular craft that appeared to be slightly larger than the spheres came into view from behind a tree. It looked black (but it was difficult to tell with the twilight fading) and it had the same red and white lights, but the white lights seemed to be arranged in a rectangle from my viewpoint. I didn���t notice any sound, although I may have been too distracted to notice. I watched it head slowly toward the direction of the two spheres flight path. As it passed out of view, I frantically tried to call friends that lived south of me, but none of them picked up. I genuinely hope that someone else saw this or can explain what I did see, because after talking with my friends, I know that I won���t be able to talk to people about this without some kind of corroboration. I have no photos and no other witnesses, just an unbelievable story. All I can do is post this everywhere in the hopes that someone can verify what I saw."],"Latitude":"37.558546","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-122.271079"}
