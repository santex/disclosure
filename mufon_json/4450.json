Therefore, I began to take up sky watching on a daily basis for about 10-15 each day. That's all it appears to take. I was sky-watching about 3.15pm PST today. At 3.22 pm, I saw a 'brush-stroke-like' part of the sky turn a slightly lighter color of blue, and then a white sphere appeared to 'fall out' of that brush-stroke. I can't explain it any other way. It just fell out, and hung there for seven minutes, until 3.29 pm. The brush-stroke was horizontal relative to the horizon, and the object fell out, or maybe 'rolled out'would be a better term, like a marble, but very fast. The 'brush-stroke' quickly faded after the white sphere fell out. After 7 minutes, the white sphere appeared to get smaller and smaller until it vanished from view. The white sphere was about the size of Mars."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"38.759844","Date Submitted":"02/18/2006 03:22 UTC","Case Number":"4450","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4450.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4450.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Summary":"white sphere rolls out of hole in sky","City":"Roseville","Date of the Event":"02/18/2006 03:22 UTC"}
