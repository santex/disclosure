(using 1,500ft for comparison, the light-object would have been the size of a large suv). the intesity of the flamy light at that point was like a sodium vapor streetlamp at, say, 100ft, possibly 150ft. it was brighter than anything in the sky. at that point i stepped inside and grabbed my best 7x binoculars and had an excellent view of the object for 30 seconds or more. i tracked it from its position nearly overhead until it flew out of sight behind a bank of aspen trees. i saw no structure, or wings, or stabilizers, or rotors, or any sort of physical outline. the color of the light did not change. no other light sources were visible on it or around it, no running lights, no landing lights, no flashing or pulsing light, no rainbows, etc. just a slightly-flaming fat oval-shaped light, clipping right along, just going about its business. it flew smoothly and straight. i had the impression that the silent propulsion source provided for very tight control - no change in speed, no wobbles, no banking or rolls, no yaw movement. it made a straight pass over the east flank of mt. scott, and continued directly at the same height and speed to the northeast in the direction of troutdale on the columbia river. at my last look in the distance it was in the shape of an sort of flattened egg and still quite luminous. i had been star watching with my pooldle at my feet, and when the object approached, i glanced down and and saw the dog was frozen into the position he takes when he hears a rabbit in the garden - head up totally rigid. it may be that a rabbit was actually there, but to me those moments had a sort of \"cone of silence\" feel to it with both of us conscious of that interesting light. perfectly at ease. i was left with a feeling that whoever was operating that light wanted to be seen - that it was an intentional demonstration, maybe showing off, right out in front of everyone. and moreso, that they wanted to show off to me, and i had this feeling of being sort of lucky. that sounds rather silly and selfish, and but doubt others saw it and feel the same. anyway, this was a wonderful sight and special -even if it was something ordinary in the air just dressed up with lights. something else: when the light disappeared to the northeast i waited for another 10 minutes hoping it might fly back to give us another look. i really wanted to see it again. nothing happened. i called out to my dog \"hey call those guys back here i want another look at them...you've got a loud enough bark, they'll hear it.\" he's trained and fun and responds to my voice no matter what nonsense i put to him. a just a few moments later.... something very odd - a commercial 737 with all lights switched on made an \"out of the blue\" unusually low, unusual straight west to east pass directly overhead ��� at approximately the same altitude or lower than the light ��� the lowest i have seen these craft fly over the city. very low and it seemed to just appear, no sound of it approaching. it was low and slow that i could see underbody in part illuminated by ground light sources. that aircraft continued on to the east at that same altitude, gunning its jets noisily, and went out of sight behind a bank of trees - the sound went away just as quickly. while my location is at the edge of an outer-pdx aircraft approach corridor, air traffic is virtually always routed from south to north, about a mile or more to the east of me, and absolutely always at a higher altitude. that 737 was almost stunning and oddly coincidental. i went inside, got on the internet and read that another portland area person had reported seeing amber-colored luminous objects, he called \"flying streetlights\" moving over east portland two days earlier."],"Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were 2 other sightings in Portland on or around July 9th 2009"],"City":"Portland","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18133.html"],"Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","Log Number":"US-07172009-0005"}
