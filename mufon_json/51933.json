First I think it was the moon or a globus, but after the object went N to NE and I could see some lights (I think they were but I am not sure at this point, maybe blue). The object first was stopping but then it began move slowly and at 15 mins aprox. its accelerations was very fast and dissapier. First I don't look the object seriously but when it began move I was very exciting, it was amazing."],"Summary":"Liminous ball","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","City":"Les Escaldes","Region":"Escaldes-Engordany","Date of the Event":"10/27/2013 03:00 UTC","Longitude":"1.538786","Tags":"City","Case Number":"51933","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"10/30/2013 11:06 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51933.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51933.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.51008","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Les Escaldes","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"AD-10302013-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"Andorra"}
