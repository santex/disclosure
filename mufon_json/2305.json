I began watching more closely and watched as these lights would godiagonal and then go up. Some would dance around and on several occasions I sawtwo lights streak and then move up and down towards each other, reversedirection and then go toward the moon. The was very bright as it came up into mysight line and if you looked at the moon it seemed these objects came fromthere. It was almost as if they were flares, but they would change direction andmoved almost constantly. It could be a natural phenomenom, but it was certainlyamazing The speed was remarkable and at the vast far off distance, they had tobe going amazingly fast. Could they be meteors breaking streaking down and thenbouncing off the atmosphere Whatever it was, it was pretty odd."]}
