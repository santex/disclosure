{"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Tonawanda","There were no other sightings in Tonawanda on or around February 6th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a very clear night with a full moon. I was standing in my driveway with a friend when we noticed what at first appeared to be a star, but the object began streaking across the sky headed in northern and slightly eastern direction. My friend thought perhaps it was a satellite. But as the object moved directly overhead, it appeared to grow in size (perhaps descending?) and the light became much more intense and brighter. The object then continued moving northeast and faded in intensity, but moved in a non-linear path, curving from a northeast path to a northwest path, until it faded from sight."],"Longitude":"-78.85313","Log Number":"US-03122012-0013","Summary":"Streaking light headed North / North East","Date of the Event":"02/06/2012 07:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.959831,+-78.85313(36421)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36421) map </A>","Object Features":"None","City":"Tonawanda","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"42.959831","Region":"New York","Case Number":"36421","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36421.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36421.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/12/2012 10:33 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
