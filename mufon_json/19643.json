At the top of the hill getting ready to turn onto our street I stopped my vehicle as I saw the object hovering in the air. The object was hovering in the air above the vineyard valley below, I sat watching the object hover and noticing the structure and trying to determine what it was. I was connected with sticks, strings or a structure forming a triangle. I saw the object and my son accompanying me in the truck saw it as well and he saw it streak across the sky."],"City":"Pilot Hill","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
