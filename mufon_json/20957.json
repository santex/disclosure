I was looking up at the sky at stars on a clear night when i saw a triangular object barely visible. This object seemed just to fly over the tree tops, very low flying object. It made no sound at all. The most strangest thing besides seeing the object that was about a block wide was that it was semi visible. I could not see it until it was directly overhead. As soon as it went over us and was at an angle i could not see it anymore like it was invisible. I tried my best to keep an eye on it but it just disappeared. As soon as i saw it i shouted \"Oh my God!\" thats when my wife looked up and saw the same object i did. We were both shaken up about this scared and excited that we saw this thing. I did not feel threatend as it just seem to ignore us. Also i think it is worth to not that there is a commercial airport just a few miles from the sighting."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/11/2009 03:01 UTC","Longitude":"-97.495394","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20957.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20957.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Brownsville","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
