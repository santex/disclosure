I happened to glance upward to the north and noticed a bright orange glowing light quickly traversing the sky from west to east. All three of us watched the object as it gradually slowed and wobbled slightly in its course, flickered and dulled a bit and then moved due east until it disappeared on the eastern horizon. I am curious if any other Monroe county or neighboring community member witnessed the sight. It definitely was not a plane. The color was distinctively orange and there were no flashing lights. It was also larger in diameter and lower in the sky than a plane or satellite. The sky was very clear and the temperature around 58 degrees. My guess is it was a meteor. However, the length of time in the sky as well as change of speed and course did leave us curious. My son did attempt to record the incident with his cell phone but I am not sure how successful he was as I have yet to view the video."],"Date Submitted":"04/17/2009 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.627992","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Orange glowing light moving west to east.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lambertville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"16565","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.765882","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date of the Event":"04/17/2009 10:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle"}
