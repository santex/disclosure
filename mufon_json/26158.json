I was walking with 2 other friends of mine, when suddenly i looked up in the sky, because some few more people were looking in that direction in the sky. What we saw was very strange. Some 12-15, star like, extremely small, just like stars, but were RED in color, were moving in the sky as a group. They were moving quite slowly, not ver fast. Their movement can be described in the following manner- : 2 in the front, then, some gap followed by 1, then gap followed by 3 more and so on. But they all were moving in 1 direction and there were around 15 of them. All were red in color. We tried making a video of it but could not. Then after sighting them for a minute or so, since it was very cloudy here, they went behind the clouds one by one and then we did not see them again."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mysuru","There were no other sightings in Mysuru on or around October 28th 2010"],"Date Submitted":"10/28/2010 03:02 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26158.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26158.html"],"Log Number":"IN-10282010-0007","Country":"India","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=12.303534,+76.64611(26158)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26158) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","City":"Mysuru","Region":"Karnataka","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Star shaped, red colored, 12-15 in number moving in a group."}
