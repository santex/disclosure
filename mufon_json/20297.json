I was hearing some weird noises as I was eating a midnight snack. I then went to my room when I was done. I sat down on my bed and looked out the window (which is right above the head of the bed) to look at the stars. Suddenly I saw this star get bright and it looked like it was coming right at me. I woke my husband up while saying \"What is that thing?\" He saw it and said that it was just a star. It then started dimming out. He looked up again and said \"Yeah it's gone!\" I layed down scared and shaky and said \"Maybe it was just a meteorite.\" Two minutes later I looked up again and it was dimming out again. I pulled my blanket over my head and had a rapid heart beat. I thought I was going to get abducted. I saw them and they might have seen me too,I was thinking. I lost sight of the object not wanting to look anymore. I then fell asleep. Did anyone else in the San Fernando Valley see this too? It was like at 4:30 in the morning on November 3,2009."],"Region":"California","Tags":"City"}
