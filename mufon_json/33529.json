I was with a friend. We were walking back from the beach when I first noticed it. What made me notice it, was that it was a perfect large circle. It must have been at least a mile wide. Starlike in appearance. We were in awe of it. I have never personally seen anything like that. I have seen other ufos in my lifetime. As well as been abducted etc. I didn't have any fear. My girlfriend and I knew it wasn't of this earth. It wasn't stars in alignment. Unfortunately, we didn't have a camera with us at the time. We didn't actually lose sight of it. It stayed for a very long time. We went back to the farm."],"Latitude":"49.835256","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-124.52476","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.835256,+-124.52476(33529)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33529) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"11/21/2011 08:12 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"British Columbia","Date of the Event":"10/16/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33529.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33529.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-11212011-0016"}
