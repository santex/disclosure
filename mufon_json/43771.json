Went outside so that trees would not interfere withview,pulled out my phone and took a blurry video but you can see the lights. Woke up my wife so she wouldnt think Iwas crazy. She also saw it clearly. I got in my car and followed thelights and it was getting further away but still visible. Forgot my phone at home. When I got back home Icould still see it. When my wife got up for work it was still in the south eastern sky and could see on her way to work. I will be looking again tonight. This was not an airplane or helicopter."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Lapeer","There were no other sightings in Lapeer on or around November 8th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"City":"Lapeer","Latitude":"43.078494","Sighting Duration":"06:00:00","Log Number":"US-11082012-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.078494,+-83.426862(43771)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43771) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"{dr}bright white light with red and orange lights around it then all going back to white","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43771.html"],"Tags":"City"}
