I immediately recognized that it was not an airplane or helicopter as it was completely round, hovered, and had no blinking lights. I kept my eyes on the object as I went through an intersection and observed it for appoximately 15 seconds before it simply disappeared. I pulled the car over and parked along Division Street. I scanned the sky for the object and it appeared again approximately 30 seconds later. It was in basically the same place, though a few degrees off from its original position. Once again, it appeared to be a metalic silver spherical object with a very distinct outline - no lights, wings, rotors. I watched it for approximately 10 seconds before it disappeared or \"winked out\" once again. I continued to sit in the same position and scan the sky for 10 more minutes, but did not see it again. NOTE 1: I don't know if it's relevant or not, but observing the object did not make me feel excited, scared or uneasy; I simply felt as if I was observing any other sort of object. NOTE 2: This is the second time I have seen an object in the air above Stevens Point, WI, that fits the description of the object listed above. I did not report the object the first time I saw it."],"Log Number":"US-05292012-0030","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"05/29/2012 11:34 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38644.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38644.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"44.531704","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Stevens Point","There were 14 other sightings in Stevens Point on or around May 29th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"I observed a solid spherical object hover in the air, disappear, reappear and then disappear.","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"38644","Region":"Wisconsin","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
