They would light up and then turn off. Then they separated into different directions. With lights turning on and off in short intervals. Then they disappeared altogether. I called my husband when I first saw them and he witnessed them also. They were an yellow-orangish color. At first I thought it they were planes or something and going through clouds. But there were no clouds and the stars were clearly visible. They were moving at a high rate of speed when the separated. At first they were hovering. I thought we should report the event to someone. So I just looked on line and found this site. I've never seen this type of thing before."],"Longitude":"-87.980626","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Arlington Heights","There were no other sightings in Arlington Heights on or around March 17th 2006"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
