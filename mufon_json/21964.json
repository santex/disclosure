It was sort of swirling around and the lightts were flashing off and on I kinda felt a bit sick in the stomach with a burning thing in my chest but after I lost sight all of the feelings went away making me feel drained wth no emotion. I lost sight of the object after I fell to my knees, writhing in agony."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Large, bright","Date of the Event":"02/21/2010 02:20 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in New Baltimore","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.767339,+-77.728326(21964)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21964) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/21/2010 02:47 UTC","City":"New Baltimore","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
