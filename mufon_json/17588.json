I looked up in the sky for no particular reason, and a moving object caught my eye. It was almost directly above me and looked like a bright star, but it was moving to the north about the speed of a commercial airliner, with ballistic motion. I would have probably brushed it off as some sort of aircraft if the light had not started to dim. It seemed to dim at a constant rate, and then began to light up again at the same rate. It remained at its original brightness for a second or so before it began dimming again. This time the light went completely out. I waited for about 10 seconds to see if it would return, but it never did. I then went inside to the party. After seeing it, I was excited as I tried to rationalize what could have caused the light. I have never seen a plane's lights do something like that before, and there was no explanation for why the light wouldn't have returned if it were a plane, they sky was completely clear. There was no tail of any kind, and the speed did not fit a comet or meteor."],"City":"St Louis","Summary":"Moving, bright, star-like object dimmed, lit back to original brightness, then dimmed completely, not seen again.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.629592,+-90.197914(17588)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17588) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Log Number":"US-06212009-0010","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17588.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17588.html"],"Longitude":"-90.197914","Case Number":"17588","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"38.629592","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in St Louis","There were no other sightings in St Louis on or around November 26th 2008"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
