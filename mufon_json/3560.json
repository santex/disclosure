{"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsWatching Television and heard helicopter. Went outside to investigate. Looked NNW and saw flickering light in sky. Thought it was a childs silver balloon at first. Object moved slowly either north or down and then to the east. When object shifted from shiny to dark it appeared to be a cube shape. Observed for eleven minutes. My attention was taken away by a high flying airliner that was flying NNW and when I again looked the object had disappeared. This object appeared to be far away and I observed it through binoculars. I knew I was looking at something unusual, or had the feeling I was anyway."],"Log Number":"US-07092005-0001","Date Submitted":"07/09/2005 05:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-121.4944","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","City":"Sacramento","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.581572,+-121.4944(3560)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3560) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"38.581572","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around July 9th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3560.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/3560_submitter_file1__P1010005a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3560.html"],"Case Number":"3560","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"California","Summary":"erratic flashing object turned bright white to brownish color alternating","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Date of the Event":"07/09/2005 05:00 UTC"}
