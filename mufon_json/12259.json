I looked over to my friend and said \"hey! look a ufo!\". We both stood there and watched this object glide through the sky, always staying at the same altitude throug the whole duration. At first we both thought that the wind picked up some trash and was carring it away, but the object appeared to be spinning and even though it dipped (like a kite) it managed to stay at the altitude. It's hard to detemine the size of the object but it was big enough to see and keep track of until it vanished. We both watched the object for around 5 minutes just spinning and heading in a North - Northeast direction. I was suprised to see something like that during the busy part of the day and in the same air lane that heliocopters fly."],"trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around August 28th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date of the Event":"08/28/2008 04:16 UTC","City":"Fort Worth","Log Number":"US-08292008-0006","Date Submitted":"08/28/2008 04:16 UTC"}
