I was sitting in the van looking at the stars because its was a clear night. Out of nowhere 3 bright orange looking fire balls appeared out of nowhere. My first thought was we were being under attack. Sounds funny but you never know now adays how thing have been. But when I notice the objects flying slow, I got out the van and took a picture. My fiance noticed them right away too. I kept looking at the sky and the guy next to us and hid wife were stund. The mans wife then noticed a forth one following the othere three not to far behind. As we were watching them fly slowly away, they were diappearing one by one. We all couldn't think what just had happened. I was really never a believer of ufos, until that night. I have done researched about ufos since then and from what I saw that night other people as well have. Thats a night I will never forget."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Arlington Heights","Object Features":"None"}
