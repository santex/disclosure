Within the circle I noted a spherical, orb-like object, red as Christmas paper and but not shiny like a balloon which is what I initially suspected it to be. It was way up there, moving very slowly in a northeast direction and never changed position. Didn't excite me or change my attitude...no big deal. I watched it for a while continuing to clean my car, and eventually the clouds rapped around it and it was gone. The sky that day was partly cloudy and the sun was out in random moments, but I saw it clearly, but was too far for a phone picture. I did happen to see a military helicopter in the vicinity, but it is not uncommon as the National Guard Base is at the RDU airport which is about 5 miles from where the event took place."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/18/2012 01:25 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Raleigh","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
