I was located around N 46������ 34.652 W 087������ 28.644 the explosion was near the handle of the little dipper. There are few city lights and it was not a firework. What struck me as odd was that I was looking right at it when it happened because there were a bunch of shooting stars in the same small area just minutes prior. The light itself was like a fireball maybe a tenth the size of the moon and it pulsated once, and when it \"exploded it was like a spiral coming right at me. It made my body tingle like lightning does but that was probably just the shock of seeing it."],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Marquette","There were no other sightings in Marquette on or around June 29th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/29/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/02/2010 08:13 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.548324,+-87.388697(24082)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24082) map </A>","City":"Marquette","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
