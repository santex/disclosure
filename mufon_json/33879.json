It's changed me forever. I was frozen in my tracks and I just stared in complete silence cause their was no sound. It was like magic. This is not a lie or a joke. I'm serious. I got a weird feeling it was stalking me or observing me. My older brother was there with me and he was in shock. We kinda lost ourselves for that 15 seconds. It moved toward us real slow and then took off straight into deep space so fast that a tracer was left behind for atleast 2-3 seconds. I have dreams about that night. I dream that I go back in time to see it happen again."],"Object Shape":"Unknown"}
