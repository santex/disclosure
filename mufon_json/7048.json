As we watched, it came down faster and faster.We were sure we were witnessing a plane crash. My wife started to worry because it no longer looked like an airplane...bigger, and had something coming from the back of it. It was glowing brightly. We were going to call the authorities, but before we could, it immediatly stopped. It kind of changed shape, from oval, to slightly disk shaped, and had a very bright glow. It just hovered, for maybe 2 minutes, and then bolted straight forward, so fast, that it was out of sight in just a couple of seconds. my wife and i just looked at each other, not sure what to do."],"Case Number":"7048","Log Number":"US-05202007-0002","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Oval","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Omaha","Region":"Nebraska","Latitude":"41.257583","Summary":"It first looked like a crashing plane, then stopped changed shape, and bolted away","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
