{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on Raytown Road and 63rd Street sitting at a red light. I was heading to a friend's house. I noticed the object because a lady in the car next to me had out a video camera and was pointing it at the sky. When I first saw the object I knew it was a UFO because I have never seen anything like that before. I am familiar with commercial airplanes and military airplanes and this was neither. The object was hovering over the Raytown Water Tower. It hovered for five seconds from when I first saw it, then it rose up ten feet flipped over and slowly flew down Raytown Road toward the west. I chased after it and all of a sudden it emitted a black contrail and increased speed dramatically and disappeared. I thought it was the craziest thing I have ever seen and didn't think anyone would believe me. A friend of my sister posted on facebook that her son had spotted a UFO in the Lee's Summit Mo area. After I spotted the UFO I called KMBC news and they reported four or five spottings of the same aircraft."],"Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-94.463455","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 08:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Raytown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Raytown","There were 3 other sightings in Raytown on or around October 4th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","Log Number":"US-10052011-0001","Summary":"The UFO hovered over Raytown water tower then flew away.","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Case Number":"32353","Date Submitted":"10/05/2011 12:12 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.00779,+-94.463455(32353)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32353) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32353.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32353.html"],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"39.00779","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
