It was in late October 1973 and I was an eight year old boy living in Oak Ridge,TN. Around 9pm I left my brother and was running home to get a jacket, as it was getting cold. As I ran across a field in front of an apartmnent complex, I heard a strange humming sound. I stopped and looked to the northeast, where I saw a large, light blue colored sphere approaching the city. It slowed down and as it did, the pitch of the humming changed. The sound remained the same pitch as it passed over the city(about 15 seconds). The sound then changed back to a higher pitch as it increased sppeed and left my field of vision. The oddest thing was that it was clearly a very large sphere of blue and unlike any aircraft I have ever seen to this day."],"Longitude":"-84.264525","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Tennessee","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.019686,+-84.264525(13469)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13469) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
