It is hard to tell what the shape is, but it appears that it is not an airplane and based on the description from the owner of the picture, it was not an airplane. Also, it seems like there have been other reports of a similar object in Wyoming. It is possible that the object is a UAV of some sort, but it is not one that is public knowledge? Hopefully the shape can be identified. It was reported as silver in color and that is what appears to be the case in the photos. The object has been seen more than one time in the same area."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/22/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"41.149241","Region":"Wyoming","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Cheyenne","There were no other sightings in Cheyenne on or around May 22nd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Other","Summary":"Silver boomerang shape - possible drone?","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Unknown","Case Number":"23414","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/24/2010 03:43 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.149241,+-104.815806(23414)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23414) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Cheyenne","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
