{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown,N/A","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had just finished my daily walk when I saw a probably white light in the sky (sunset was occurring around then). It was about 8:30 p.m. then. It must have been between 45 degrees and 90 degrees above the horizon; I'd guess about 70 degrees above the horizon. Whenever I started looking around, I would lose sight of the object, and it would take a few seconds to find it again. The object was stationary, as far as I could tell, with sunset, planes, and clouds drawing my attention every couple of minutes. I thought it was just a balloon or a star, but it seemed to not move at all, meanwhile a cloud was changing its position every 30-seconds-to-a-minute, so I don't think it was a balloon. Then, sometime before 9:30 p.m., I'd guess about 8:47 p.m., the object wasn't there anymore when I tried to look for it. I thought it had disappeared behind a cloud, but the object still wasn't there even after the cloud passed."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown, N/A","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Northville","There were no other sightings in Northville on or around July 11th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07112013-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.437146,+-83.481659(48874)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48874) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48874.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48874.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"48874","Longitude":"-83.481659","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Northville","Region":"Michigan","Latitude":"42.437146","Tags":"City","Summary":"Daytime white stationary light in sky that wasn't there about 20 minutes later","Date Submitted":"07/11/2013 09:35 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/11/2013 08:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
