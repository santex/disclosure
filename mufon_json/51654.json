I looked at the window where I live in south london (croydon) and I saw two objects hovering in the sky not very far, they where white and were emiting some sort of white \"lantern\" as if patroling the sky a few hundred meters in the sky. they stood there for a few minutes 3 to 10 minutes, then started moving forward slowly. I have the habit of looking up in the sky to see planes , stars and possible UFOs. i suspected they were UFO at the glance. ( i dont know why) I was very impressed, It was my first time i had clearly seen a UFO. I was thinking about filming It , but could not know where the camera was, i looked it with a binoclus, was a bright white light. then they moved very far from my window sight. It was 2 or possible 3 UFos. from that time , I noticed some times some lights flying around , that does not apear to be plane , since there were no strobe light, the green red wing light. I suspect they were man made , high tech space craft. but could be alien. i have some you tube videos also that shows UFOs."],"Date of the Event":"09/04/2011 07:10 UTC","Case Number":"51654","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.360611,+-0.11249(51654)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51654) map </A>","Country":"United Kingdom","Latitude":"51.360611","City":"Croydon"}
