It had 3 lights similar to the lights on our airplanes except they didnt flash.however weird this may sound the sky behind the craft as it flew became ominously dark (even the stars were blacked out.) then it flew impossible fast from a complete stop and flew into the horizon and the blackened sky returned to its normal state after it was gone.
