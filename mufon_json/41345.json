Pulled over in parking lot to get a better look. The orb ascended slowly at first, pulsing colors from red to orange to white-yellow, with a white aura around it. There was at least one airplane in sight upon first noticing the pulsing orb. The orb changed direction and seemed to ascend faster than before. It continued to flash these colors as it ascended faster, then quickly seemed to fly in opposite direction of I and friend, leaving area of visibility within seconds after it began to accelerate. We watched the area we had first seen it for possible return, but we had lost sight of it completely and did not see it again."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.235984,+-84.767422(41345)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41345) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.767422"}
