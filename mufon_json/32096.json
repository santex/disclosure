He was looking at what appeared to be a large craft moving very slowly just above and in front of the mountains in front of our house in Vermont. It was moving too slow for a plane, was the wrong shape, was soundless and had 3 or 4 lights that didn't blink. It took about 10 minutes to move a distance of about 5 miles before it disappeared behind the trees and we could no longer see it on its journey. We felt so blessed to see what for us was most certainly a UFO and just wished it would turn and come closer to the house so we could see more details."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Montgmery Center","Longitude":"-72.544089","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Clearly observed craft moving slowly and quietly in a direction not generally traversed by planes or satellites.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32096.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32096.html"],"Log Number":"US-09262011-0007","Region":"Vermont","Case Number":"32096","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.88869,+-72.544089(32096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32096) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"09/25/2011 09:47 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
