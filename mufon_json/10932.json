{"Summary":"Bright White Light Like A Star But Moving","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my backyard, and I looked up and noticed a white light, that looked like a very very bright star travelling northward in sky very slowly and in a straight line. The funny thing about it was that it would dim to the point where it was out, and then it would return to full brightness.. It lasted for about 20 seconds.. I thought at first it was a shooting star, but shooting stars usually travel faster through the sky, and they don't usually turn back on again.. This one was moving very slow, and it dimmed completely out in about 6-8 seconds, and then return to full brightness.. It did this 3 times, and it didn't return to full brightness again. I waited and watch for a little longer and nothing else happened. I checked for shower activity at this time of year, and I don't see any forecasts for shooting star activity. I wanted to post this in case there are any other reports of strange activity in the sky on this night in Arizona.. Thank you."],"Date of the Event":"05/26/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"Arizona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.533844,+-111.941125(10932)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10932) map </A>","Tags":"City","City":"Paradise Valley","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Paradise Valley","There were no other sightings in Paradise Valley on or around May 26th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-111.941125","Date Submitted":"05/26/2008 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05272008-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"10932","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10932.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10932.html"],"Latitude":"33.533844","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
