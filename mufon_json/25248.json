{"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"25248","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile taking an evening walk, I looked up and saw a rectangle shaped object moving eastwast across the sky. It seem to have a squared edge with 4 circular lights then a gap the same width and then 4 more circular lights across the edge. I was thinking about all the things it couldbe...i.e. a spider web across my eye sight, a reflection from a plane, a plane, but they were quickily ruled out. I was keenly focusing on it as it was about to reach a tree line and before it reached the trees it seemed to evaporate."],"Latitude":"39.71251","Date Submitted":"08/30/2010 10:34 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/29/2010 07:45 UTC","Longitude":"-105.074133","Summary":"Rectangle shaped object with 8 circular lights across it with a gap between them moving across the sky.","Sighting Duration":"00:01:25","Log Number":"US-08302010-0014","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.71251,+-105.074133(25248)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25248) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25248.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25248.html"],"City":"Lakewood","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Lakewood","There were no other sightings in Lakewood on or around August 29th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
