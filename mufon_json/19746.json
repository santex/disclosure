It was about 10-10:30 pm and I walked out my back door and around to the front drive to lock up my car for the night. Just as got to the end of the sidewalk and to the top of the driveway I say a BRIGHT orange orb-like shape in the North, NorthEast sky. I stared at it for a moment as it was VERY bright and larger than any of the stars. At first I thought it might be a planet but after locking my car and turning back it had disappeard. It did not move, it glowed very faintly. I stopped and proceeded to lock up my car, as I was walking back less than a minute later I looked up again and it was no where to be seen. I was a little freaked out, I went into the house and told my step mom. She said that she and my dad have seen very similar things in that area in the sky and that they think it must be UFO's. I thought that was weird because my parents were very serious about it and they are not the type of people to believe anything that hasn't been proven to be real."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Buck Creek 1mi , Lafayett","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
