It was low and we initially thought it was a helicopter- which we see often in our area. However, it was silent; and did not blink. It was about 50-55 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be flying as low as many of the smaller planes and helicopters from the Winder and Gwinnett airports fly. It changed its course and travelled to the east, toward the moon. We followed it behind the tree line, but it simply disappeared. Naturally, we kept our eyes on the sky. We were excited to see something that we could not identify. Just under two minutes later, following the exact same path, was another (or the same) red light. It was silent, in the same position in the sky, and did not blink. It headed east and disappeared right in between us and the moon, as the moon���s light is much brighter. Other small planes were seen in the sky before and after the sightings; all of which had blinking lights and made sound. I am a scientist, and having eliminated other natural or known manmade flying objects, have decided that this is beyond my scope and would like to see what a more experienced sky-watcher may have to say about this event."],"Summary":"Fireball that changed direction and made no sound vanished behind treeline. Two minutes later, another one followed the same path.","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
