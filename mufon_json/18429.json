It looked like it had a smaller circle of light in the center and spikes of light all around it. It looked like one of those sun's that children draw with a circle and the lines coming out all around it. I woke up my wife and had her take a picture of it. My wife pressed auto levels and colors came out. It looked exactly like this without all the colors before she pressed auto levels, though."],"Date of the Event":"08/01/2009 12:00 UTC","City":"Portage","Log Number":"US-08012009-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18429_submitter_file1__spaceship.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18429_submitter_file2__flyingsaucer.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18429.html"],"Region":"Michigan","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"42.203764","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.203764,+-85.570362(18429)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18429) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Round object with lines of light around it","Case Number":"18429","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.570362"}
