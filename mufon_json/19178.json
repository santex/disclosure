I realized it was moving when i stopped my car. I then noticed a dimmer object beside it moving at the same speed. The objects were at the same height in the sky as Jupiter and to the east. They moved slowly together in the same direction for about one minute before quickly fading away. They stayed the same distance from each other the entire time. There were no blinking lights or noise and appeared to be VERY high in the sky. Very exciting to watch, whatever they were."]}
