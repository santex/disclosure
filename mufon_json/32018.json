The blinds to the bathroom window are always up so we can see the backyard in the evenings. The window faces east. I walked into the bathroom and glanced out the window. There was a square object about 500 ft away in the sky. I say a swayed object only because the lights that illuminated it were in a square shape. The 4 lights were solid with other lights in the middle of the box that blinked underneath it. It flew very fast and was heading east, then turned south and headed towards the airport. It could definitely have been a plane but none that I have ever seen before and it was not flying in the usual flight path of most other planes I watch that land at mccarran."],"Latitude":"36.210047","Tags":"City","Region":"Nevada","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular"}
