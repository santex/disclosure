While standing on my deck, I witnessed an aircraft approaching my home from around 10-20 ft above the trees. I yelled for my two kids to come see. The craft was directly above our house around 40- 100 ft above and silent. It had two very bright front lights. As it hovered (1 minute) it took off in a flash. It went from west to south. It disappeared above my neighbors tree. The sky was clear with many stars. The craft was silent with no air pressure. It looked just like a stealth bomber."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"46040","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-84.267684","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.120991,+-84.267684(46040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46040) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/05/2013 12:11 UTC","Log Number":"US-03052013-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Cincinnati","Summary":"Triangle in shape with two very bright headlights.","Latitude":"39.120991","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Cincinnati","There were no other sightings in Cincinnati on or around September 1st 2002"],"Region":"Ohio","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
