I noticed what I thought was a star because I remembered it from the night before. But tonight this object seemed to glow red and turn blue. I thought maybe it was an aircraft but it seemed to be hovering in one spot for along time. Finally this object seemed to be getting lower to the ground. I left and went back inside, and when I came back out, this object was nowhere to be seen."],"Date Submitted":"09/17/2003 09:30 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Kokomo","Case Number":"2546","Log Number":"","Region":"Indiana","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There were no other sightings in Kokomo on or around September 17th 2003"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2546.html"],"Weather Factors":"None, Unknown","Latitude":"40.492377","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"A Kokomo west side sighting","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.492377,+-86.128693(2546)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2546) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/17/2003 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
