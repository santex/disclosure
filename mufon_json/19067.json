We have captured quite a number odd objects in the sky using this method. One pic appears to corroborate pictures taken in NY recently. (report 19048)My cheap camera takes a pic every three secondso submitted is 2 pics, one of the object and another 3 secs later without he object. I don't have any picture editing software, but the picture is readily viewable in Windows Picture Viewer. Object is top right and to the right of the jet contrail.
