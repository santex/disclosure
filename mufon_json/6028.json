At first I thought it was just a really big airplane, then I noticed that it did not leave any contrail or other exhaust behind it. I pulled over to the side of the road and watched,two or three times I noticed the sun light would really gleam of it, no more than a total of 4 or 5 minutes, the craft moved into a large cloud bank where I lost sight of it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
