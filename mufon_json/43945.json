Very hard to miss little over one hundred yards hovering in a field just off the interstate for everyone to see. I did not stick around to investigate I just kept driving. I was not going to report this but last night I saw the same thing again out over lake Erie heading west. So obviously something is going on here in Ohio. There were many cars on the road that night so I cant be the only one to have seen it."],"Date of the Event":"10/21/2011 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"43945","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43945.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43945.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Jefferson","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.738666,+-80.769807(43945)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43945) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/16/2012 01:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"41.738666","Region":"Ohio","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"Large glowing Orb with triangles covering the surface","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Jefferson","Source":"MUFON"}
