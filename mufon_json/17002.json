Wasn't the best so I didn't upload it last night. After using Photoshop to adjust contrast & levels--this green alien head that appears to be waving was visible. Unbelievable! There were no trees in the way that could explain it. The pic named IMG_3749.JPG is the original pic out of the camera-untouched in any way. So, if you don't believe it, download it and put it in your own photo program and adjust it yourself--then stand back and look at it! Cool! I blew up the other objects in the pic so you could see them better (constrastall). The smaller white streak showed up in two pics so must not be camera flaw...probably IS a probe of some sort."],"Latitude":"40.434542","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
