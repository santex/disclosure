I have seen a round object that flashes white very slowly from dark to very bright then completely shuts off, but you can still see a small dark object flying afterwards. The first incident lasted for about 5-10 minutes. The second time was only for about a minute or 2 with only 3 flashes. The 3rd was only seconds and was only 1 flash but was absolutely the same object. I'm used to seeing meteors and airplanes where I live and this is neither."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Martinsburg","There were no other sightings in Martinsburg on or around July 11th 2011"],"Latitude":"39.46444","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Slow flashing round object that flashes dark to very bright the goes dark.","Longitude":"-77.962627","Case Number":"30130","Region":"West Virginia","Date of the Event":"07/11/2011 10:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/11/2011 10:43 UTC","Log Number":"US-07112011-0018","City":"Martinsburg","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.46444,+-77.962627(30130)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30130) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City"}
