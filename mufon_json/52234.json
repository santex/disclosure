They never moved but then one ball faded into nothing and then the other. My mother was watching tv with me and a short while later said she said one ball in a different direction still not moving but then it split into three balls in a line and by the time I saw them they split into five in a line. Then from right to left they each started to fade. About 10 to 15 minutes later we both saw two more orange balls a little ways away from the five in a line. they did the same thing. After each sighting I ran outside but heard and saw nothing. Eventually they started appearing randomly farther and farther away to the South still. A few other people I know said they had seen the same thing on either the same night or the night before."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"11/13/2013 08:30 UTC","trends":[],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52234.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52234.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11142013-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.79051,+-88.783858(52234)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52234) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/14/2013 12:49 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other"}
