They seemed to be in perfect formation with one about 65 degrees above the horizontal above the other. No sounds or noise was made, and there was a large group of people there who saw it. They made a very,very slow turn and then all of the sudden disappeared as fast as they appeared. They seemed to occupy a very small area relative to their speed. The general area was eastern towards Wyoming."],"Region":"Utah","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16132.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16132_submitter_file1__sketch.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16132.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two bright lights flying in perfect formation."}
