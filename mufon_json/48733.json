He stated that these ships could be conected together to form a circle at launch then split up and be positioned anywhere around the planet. He stated that the pilots had to be in spacesuits they flew so high. He asked how I thought that the U.S. could get thousands of tons of arms and equipment anywhere in the world in almost a blink of the eye.... I had no answer. This explains alot of sightings of arrowhead or pie shaped craft. This does not explain the rest of UFO sightings??????????. It is my belief that we as a species would have to be comepletely ignorant to think that we are the only \"thinking\" species in the universe. I just thought I should repeat what I was told from a man on his deathbed. This is the end of my statement please do not contact me.. it is just food for thought and is in realm of reality."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784901,+-119.409762(48733)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48733) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/20/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48733.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48733.html"],"Object Flight Path":"N/A","Region":"California"}
