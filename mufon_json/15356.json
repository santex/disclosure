At first I thought they were military flares or helicopters with search lights, but then I noticed that the lights would disappear, and then reappear a fairly long distance away in an instant, and then just stop. Then as I watched in amazement, the two lights broke apart into about nine different lights that were moving erratically with no pattern, and without seeming to go anywhere. I called a friend to look in that direction from his house, but he lives about ten miles away and couldn't see anything from where he lives. I felt amazed and tried to take pictures with my phone, but the streetlights distorted the view in the camera. I was kind of freaking out and ran to my house to get my dad to come outside to look so that nobody would think I was crazy. They were gone by the time he came outside."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15356.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15356.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.477432,+-98.142828(15356)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15356) map </A>","City":"Evant","Longitude":"-98.142828","Date of the Event":"02/05/2009 07:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Other","Case Number":"15356","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/05/2009 07:15 UTC"}
