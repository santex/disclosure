She was in a separate car right in-front of me, we were on our cell-phones talking to each other, When all of a sudden, a very huge green spherical object started descending from the sky and eventually disappeared into the low tree-line, no noise, no impact felt. We judged the object to be as big as a large-size 2 story house and approximately less than 300ft from us. It was moving slow, it was not a shooting star, a plane or helicopter. There was no noise.The middle part of the object was not bright or glowing bright like the green halo that surrounded it, I could see some detail like green flame igniting around the object.I could also look at the center of the object as it was not a bright light like comets or shooting stars, it was actually quite dim, and I'd say the middle of the object could have been either metallic or rock, I remember it looking quite smooth. There was also another vehicle in front of us that witnessed this object."],"Case Number":"39869","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
