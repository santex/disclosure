As I was looking at the stars suddenly three triangle objects materialized and flew silently from the east and headed north at the same altitude that small planes or helicopters would normally fly at. They were huge and flying in a triangle pattern.... if i were to hold my thumb up at arms length they were about as big as a basketball....massive! Each craft had 3 orange amber lights, one on each point, and the lights were constant but also seemed to leave a trail as they flew. The event lasted 2 mins and they left as quickly as they appeared."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-08272011-0005","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around August 27th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","City":"Arlington"}
