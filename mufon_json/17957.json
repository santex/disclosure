My sons' girlfriend noticed it first. We thought it was a plane. It came into sight at a great speed then it slowed and finally hovered. We passed the binoculars amongst us. None of us could identify the object, or how far away it was. After these few minutes it just started to fade and then it was gone. There were 6 adults and 5 children and we all seen it. No one really wanted to talk about it much."]}
