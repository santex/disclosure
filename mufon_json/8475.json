I have to agree with original poster. These are not \"flares\" as one person would like us to think. And if they where birds look at the distance from camera shot to objects...they would be extremely large birds considering they seem to be some distance away. And the one of Estrella Mnt, (3 objects) if they where planes thats really close formation for three large airplanes. Theres another of Estrella mnt, where if you look in the cloud cover theres a cylindrical object. The other after downloading it and zooming in does not look like a plane."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
