I and three others looked up in the shy to see three football shaped objects hovering in the sky over us. Being dark, it was difficult to determine their altitude. They had lights around their perimeters and were soundless. We were staring and wondering what they were when in formation they began to move away again soundless and as we watched they accellerated within seconds into pin sized spots of light again without any sound. All 4 of us saw this and were obviously amazed by what we saw. It happened for sure just as described."],"Date of the Event":"09/19/1969 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/02/2011 11:36 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.478886,+-82.00298(28908)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28908) map </A>","Region":"Georgia"}
