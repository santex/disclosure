Thought it was a very bright star then suddenly it moved from stationary position to the right really fast, stopped, then faded out completely. The estimation of the amount of travel is about two feet at arms length in about 2 seconds at most. The light made some sort of lighted trail the length of travel, that did not linger. Probably 35 degrees high in sky. Not knowing the objects size, I can't tell how far away it was, but guessing it was maybe over highway 286 or past it towards Murrysville or farther?"],"Country":"United States"}
