it was a very exciting thing to see, and i can say without a doubt that this was no beach ball, child's balloon, or any balloon for that matter. this object, or craft, ot whatever it was, seemed to be intelligently controlled, in my personal opinion. an exciting day in my life, and one that i'll never forget. i assure all of you that this story is absolutely true."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Revere","There were no other sightings in Revere on or around August 8th 2002"],"Summary":"5-Foot Diameter Dull-Black Noiseless Sphere, Buzzing Buildings","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"42.41459","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change"}
