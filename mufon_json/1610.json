It directly over me (veryhigh) ,I thought where did the bubbles of soap come from. There are no housesanywhere close . Then I thought no! it is a flock of seagulls flying very high .I tried to look as hard as i could to identify the objects. Then I realizedthey were extremly shiny .They could not possibly be birds . I watched them fora few more minuites and (aprox. 5 min total) when suddenly they completelydisappeared. Can you tell me if anyone else in my area saw the same things ?(Nova Scotia ,Canada )"],"Object Shape":"Sphere"}
