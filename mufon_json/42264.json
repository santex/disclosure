All made no sound, i figured was a jet but was absolutely no sounf. There were 9 red - orange lights and the last one was white all heading in same direction west bound. they were more or less scatterred but all were flying very fast with no tail so i eliminated a star and no sound so eliminated being jets or planes. started to lose sight when i was yelling to get my camera and the lights zipped over the horizon. When i called a friend and was on phone telling him they were heading his direction the white orb was last and made my cell phone go completely static. I had to run inside to get house phone and by that time all orbs were out of sight."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Mentor","There were no other sightings in Mentor on or around September 2nd 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.675167","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.675167,+-81.331452(42264)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42264) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/03/2012 08:46 UTC","Log Number":"US-09032012-0011","City":"Mentor","Date of the Event":"09/02/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"42264"}
