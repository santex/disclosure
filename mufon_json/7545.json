Day sunny clear no clouds, on neighbors porch. She first spotted it and pointed for my husband and myself. First thing noticed that their was no contrail. Retangle in shape , very fast, my husband estimated at 400miles per hour. Approximately 10,000ft. Located in south west portion of the sky. Observed 5 minutes. On each side of craft two black pencil lines and waves. Like heat waves off pavement.Very strange.My first thought was the talk of the aurora space craft? I live in the coutry where it is flat and wide open. We see alot of planes all day and we all agree that it wasn't like any we have observes before. Thank-you.
