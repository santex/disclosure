Have noted orbs, unusual amount of planes in flight path to the international airport about a mile from here as crow flies. Unbelievably, saw a ship appear out of a haze of bright light then disappear within seconds. Counted 4 shooting stars in a one hour period -one of which had a red tail just before seeing the ship. I have a small window on the universe but I cannot believe what is happening in my backyard.There seems to be several unusual star-like objects that hover above -One in particular that is stationary flashing multicolor lights. This one appears nightly. This all happened in one of viewing over a three to four hour period.I am now watching nightly when clear because they are concentrated in the area."],"City":"Wellington","Case Number":"31923","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.871804,+-63.597223(31923)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31923) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31923.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31923.html"]}
