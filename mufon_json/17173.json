I would estimate the objects flew about 5 miles in about 20-30 seconds then we lost the in the clouds. one of the guys thought they might have been ducks, i dont think so, ducks don't fly high enough to go through clouds let alone storm clouds, and i did not see any wings, when ducks fly you can clearly see their wings. I do a lot of fishing I am very familiar with the local wildlife, I have never seen birds fly that high, was almost a perfect semi circle, and flying way too fast"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.853257,+-75.348146(17173)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17173) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Chester","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Chester","There were no other sightings in Chester on or around May 25th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17173.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17173.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"39.853257","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"30-50 black dots high in the sky flew through storm clouds at a high rate of speed.","Case Number":"17173","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/25/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05262009-0016","Object Shape":"Other"}
