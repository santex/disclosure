(i wish you had a spot here that i could doodle this out for you in a sketch)... but any way, the object after a minute or two observing it, i then realized how it could not be a star cause it looked more like a planet and yet it was no planet cause it was way too big (bout 1\\5 size of moon) and it was motion less! it was dead south and my dad was not far away probably 1\\8 of a mile so i quikly returned hoping to get him and return in time so he could see this unreal sight as well. but when we got back (which was really quick)... the object i saw just above the treeline behind that pasture..well it was gone. this happened really near to collosse rd. on the windsor side of the road and not the walters side on hwy 258 in ilse of wight county va. thank you for your time. p.s. there have been many strange observations in our area between me and my father that were witnessed by us both that have been without question of unknown origins and have not acted either as satelites, comets, normal manmade craft, planets or stars...... we do know how to distinguish these from one another....... many more i am sure would see these thing too if they only took the time to look up at our sky. my account to you is accurate as well as truthfull... you can be assured of this.... thank-you... i see that i can attatch a sketch.. i will"],"Region":"Virginia","Log Number":"US-09222008-0023","City":"Suffolk","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Suffolk","There were no other sightings in Suffolk on or around June 15th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"12728","Latitude":"36.728205","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.728205,+-76.583562(12728)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12728) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/15/2008 09:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Summary":"fire red...completely still..hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
