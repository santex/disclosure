I was in the back seat. (We had decided to carpool, first driving to my girlfriend's house) Her interior lights (radio, spedometer, etc..) had acted up much much more than usual, as she pointed out and complained about throughout the night. Though, it could have been because it was 0 degrees out. Anyway...in the sky to our slight right there was a bright blue flash (about the size of a spool of thread if i stretched out my arm). My boyfirend was asleep and didn't notice it, but as soon as I saw it my girlfriend shouted \"did you see that?\" of course. We both looked at eachother, and I kept a watchful eye the whole way home."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.9202,+-88.078849(4457)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4457) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cone, Flash","Latitude":"41.9202","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4457.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4457.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"a bright blue cone shaped flash, from a point expanding down and right.","Case Number":"4457","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-88.078849","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
