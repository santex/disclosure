Did not observe the phenomena until picture was uploaded to my laptop. The picture of the object appeared in only one of my photographs. All of the photographs were taken with in a few minutes of each other. Does not appear to be moving. I guess it could have been a digital glitch, but have never had this happen. I was trying out a new camera with a very strong telephoto lens."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37842.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37842_submitter_file1__100_0027.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37842.html"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Jasper","There were no other sightings in Jasper on or around February 26th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
