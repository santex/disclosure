Thinking it was going to be a firework display, I stated to my boys, \"here comes a big one\" but it never exploded. It moved in a straight horizonal line at about 45 degrees fromt the horizon and moved due north, never rising or falling from that line of view. It moved at a consistant speed towards the north until it disappeared from sight, this being approximately 30-45 seconds. It did not blink or flash and no sound was heard. I'm sure a few of the surrounding neighbors witnessed the same thing because the fireworks suddenly ceased until it moved out of sight. I quickly contacted a friend, a NASA Embassador with her own observatory, to question if anything was scheduled to be in the sky at that time....nothing. I don't know what it was but it sure sparked my interest and couriousity."],"Region":"Indiana","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.252269"}
