When I was done, as always I looked up at the stars, only five seconds after looking up I noticed a translucent oval object right under the cloud line would be. It appeared to continue to go at a straight line weaving a little. Like maybe following a highway? I watched it till the houses wouldnt let me anymore. There was no sound, just pure bliss because I knew what I was seeing it was a ufo and was so excited that I am the Lucky one to get to see this wonderful experience. Ive been waiting along time for this. As I am very much into the universe!"],"Summary":"{cak} was translucent and the size of a penny trvld east to west weaving like following hway right below cloud level","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.559734,+-85.655076(44344)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44344) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44344.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44344.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
