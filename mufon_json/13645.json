The jet turned on its afterburner, since there was no traffic I pulled over to look at it. Thats when I saw a very large orange object with lights running around the middle. The jet turned to the same direction as the object when it did a 90 degree turn to the right. The jet turned to match the objects path. After about 5 seconds the object turned 90 degrees to the left and the jet turned to match it. After about 10 seconds the object turned to the right and the jet again followed it. The object stayed on this course for about 10 more seconds when it took off at an unbelieveable speed. It shoot across the sky and turned 90 degrees up till it was out off sight. The only person I have ever was my wife because at the time I was envolved with coaching my sons baseball and soccer and my wife and I are involved with 4H. I just didn't want anybody to know. I'm sure of what I saw though I know I saw the object and I know I saw a twin engine twin tailed jet chasing it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13645.html"],"Tags":"City"}
