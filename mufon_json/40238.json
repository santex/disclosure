Around 9:30-10:00 in (Oregon City) I was looking up in the sky for morters people were lighting off... I then noticed right away that there were two large redish orange glowing orbs side by side just hovering silently. I then told my girlfriend and her friends about it and they didn't seem to care! Or they must have thought I was crazy. I then continued to stare at these orbs and the one to the right moved on top of the other and continued hovering, then the one on top went out like a light and vanished then about 30 seconds later the second orb vanished as well.... I hope someone else saw this so I can have some kind of proof that I'm not crazy or making this up."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Oregon City","There were no other sightings in Oregon City on or around July 4th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 02:05 UTC","Latitude":"45.360503","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"two glowing orbs","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 09:30 UTC","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-122.605758","Case Number":"40238","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.360503,+-122.605758(40238)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40238) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07052012-0073","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
