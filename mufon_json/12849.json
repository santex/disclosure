I took three photos in quick sucession in the second photo there is an odd sphere shape in the sky that i can not account for as it is not in the photos on either side of the middle photo and would like your opinion on what you think it is. As soon as i saw the photo i called the family over to show them what called a UFO. I have attached the three photos that where taken, it is the middle photo that may interest you."]}
