{"Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was turning off the pool lights at approximately 2130 hrs when I noticed three reddish orange circles traveling from nw to se. the first three were either flying in formation or on a fixed object. the next two followed in what appeared to be equally spaced distance. they traveled nw to se for approximately 2minutes, stopped and blinked out one at a time. they lit up again 1-2 minutes later and then blinked out again. I checked the sky and I could see high altitude planes flying and there was nothing similar. the next day I saw small aircraft from smith field and at a height considerably higher than the lights I could hear the motors clearly. I called the local police department and nobody reported seeing what I saw. today I called the local guard base and again nothing."],"Longitude":"-85.149773","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"lights in the night sky","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08052013-0024","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"08/03/2013 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49498.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49498.html"],"City":"Fort Wayne","Case Number":"49498","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Fort Wayne","There were no other sightings in Fort Wayne on or around August 3rd 2013"],"Latitude":"41.159436","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.159436,+-85.149773(49498)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49498) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/05/2013 03:11 UTC"}
