{"divs":["sighting details(note: i had far too many photos to upload to this so please use the photobucket links for the cropped images, and the sendspace zip link for the full sized pictures. i hope it's not too much of a hassle.) also, the time stated in the form is of my main (orange ball) sighting. the other pictures are taken from various times that day. they are also in chronological order in the zip. i don't know how to go about this matter but i will try. so anyhow, i was at my fathers house for the weekend. there was an abnormal amount of contrails in the area and i felt compelled to use my camera for the first time in several months so i decided to take pictures of the trails and the scenery at my house. i will get back to that later. my main sighting took place at around 5 or so in the afternoon. my father had asked me to go and get firewood from the barn and i reluctantly agreed. i was lagging behind a bit and by the time i left the house he was already inside the barn gathering wood. when i was almost off of my deck i heard the ever so familiar sound of a helicopter flying by and since i'm an avid fan of aviation i stopped and looked for the source of the sound. there was something quite odd about this sound, almost as if it were hollow, like a recording. i didn't pay much attention to this fact until i saw what the sound was coming from. the sound was coming from a amber\\orange ball type ufo that was moving at roughly the same speed as a slow moving helicopter (but it definitely wasn't a helicopter). i immediately dropped the wood carrier that i had in my hands and bolted inside the house to get my 4 megapixel digital camera. after scrambling around for it and putting new batteries inside i managed to get 3 pictures of the craft before it went behind the trees\\hills. i would've gotten more, but unfortunately it was impossible to see it in the viewfinder since it was displayed as white instead of orange. the weekend had passed and i was quite proud of what i managed to take a picture of. little did i know is that several of the other photographs had ufos in them also. the strange thing about these other photos is that i never saw, nor heard anything. and im 100% sure none of them are birds as it was a fairly barren day bird wise. this may not be related, but there was also a fairly odd x shaped contrail barely above the horizon (which would probably result in a jet slamming into the ground if it tried to make it). anyhow, enough of that. here are some fullsized, unaltered photos. note, i had to put them in a zip file and upload them to a website because all the image websites would resize the images. rest assured that there's nothing malicious in this file. http:\\\\www.sendspace.com\\file\\grv9b0 anyhow, as i said before the image websites resize my images so here are some cropped versions of the ufos. you should be able to find them easily using the pictures in the zip. the following pictures are displayed in the same order as the zip (and order of photos taken) for easy finding. also, i never saw any of these while taking the photos except for the one i described in the beginning of course. although i did inexplicably have ufos on the brain that day. http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing1.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing2.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing3.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing4.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing5.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing6.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing7.png x-contrail: http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing8xtrail.png main sighting (pictures in order): http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing9.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing10.png http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing11.png final picture of a formation: http:\\\\i26.photobucket.com\\albums\\c141\\thisisforoddwebsiteok\\thing12.png in closure, i am 100% positive that the main sighting, and the ones that snuck into my pictures are not birds, aircraft, or lens dirt. i have photographed many birds and airplanes and none of them look like this. what i'm curious about though, is why the amber orb sounded like a helicopter (albiet hollow)? do they have the technology to disguise their craft as one of our own? maybe there was some sort of error during the process which is why i was lucky enough to see their craft. thanks for your time. also, if for some reason you need to contact me, use my email as i'm not to comfortable with putting my phone number up."],"Region":"Oregon","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.59706,+-122.993439(6600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6600) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/17/2007 05:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"North Plains","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"6600","Latitude":"45.59706","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"03/17/2007 05:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-03212007-0008","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6600.html"],"Longitude":"-122.993439","Summary":"Visually saw orange sphere.
