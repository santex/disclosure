{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIn reply to case number 21454, after reading this report, I downloaded the photo submitted and ran it through Photoshop 7....when embossed, it appeared to be an object either trying to hide in a cloud or making a cloud to hide in.... In working with Photoshop, you can make a bump map to create the illusion of an object but the object in this photo does not appear to be created and placed by individual. I'm not an expert with Photoshop and am currently attempting to learn the art of making bump maps with this program. Can someone with more experence on bump mapping take a look at this photo and give me feed back? I would like to say congradulations to whom ever submitted this report."],"trends":[],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-105.028064","Summary":"In response to case 21454","Date Submitted":"01/12/2010 04:13 UTC","Region":"New Mexico","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01122010-0009","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"21455","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.97861,+-105.028064(21455)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21455) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.97861","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21455.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21455.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
