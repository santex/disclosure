{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Victoria","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my hot tub with a friend at 3:00pm daytime, when I saw a bright light come straight down, then take a sharp right angle & disappear behind an island less than one mile from shore. Lights don't normally travel like that. There was no sound. It traveled fast. I researched the internet to see where I could report it, but found nothing. I knew it was the strangest light I've ever seen in my life. I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things, but I really saw it."],"Date Submitted":"10/15/2013 03:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-10152013-0005","Summary":"bright light came down from sky, then turned at right angle behind island 1 mile from shore","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51567.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51567.html"],"trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Victoria","There were no other sightings in Victoria on or around July 12th 2006"],"Latitude":"48.430421","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.430421,+-123.357954(51567)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51567) map </A>","Case Number":"51567","Date of the Event":"07/12/2006 03:06 UTC","Region":"British Columbia","Longitude":"-123.357954"}
