He told me he was outside his front yard looking towards the east along with other eye witnesses. He then observed a fire ball headed west coming form the east at very high speed. My neighbor said he thought it was a meteor at first. He then said it made an immidiate stop for about 30 seconds and then began to head south in a low rate of speed. He then said all of a sudden it streaked away towards the south leaving behind a light trail. My neighbor says the obeject was approx 1000ft in the air. I just want to advise Mufon that I have filed this report with the knowledge of the eye witness. Since I am very interested in this subject I took it upon my self to report this sighting. I know it is hear-say and also know how important it is to the UFO community to have credable witnesses. I believe my neighbor will come forward if you have any questions."],"Region":"California","Date Submitted":"10/23/2009 01:31 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"20093","Log Number":"US-10232009-0009","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"FireBall meteor type","Object Shape":"Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"10/04/2009 09:45 UTC","City":"Brawley","Longitude":"-115.526807","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Brawley","There were no other sightings in Brawley on or around October 4th 2009"]}
