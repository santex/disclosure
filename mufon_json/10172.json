{"Case Number":"10172","divs":["sighting detailsfirst, we had an explosive license so we could get big class a explosive fireworks, so we do know what fireworks look like. i also am a training pilot, and work in the aviation field with maintenance, and am still going to school for my airframe and powerplant license. i am really familiar with aircraft, their behaviors, their sounds, different types of aircraft, etc etc. it has been a hobby of mine to know as much as i can as it's a dream of mine to be involved with the aviation field, since my first flight when i was 7. so i have extensive time and research into aircraft of the public knowledge. what happened: it was after the re-run showing of snl that then would play until 1am. i asked my brother if he was interested in going on the dock and looking for ufos, which even after a serious car accident of his with head trauma, he still remembers. we were out on the dock, as i don't know the exact address, but can acquire it if needed, sitting out there on the lake. there weren't any trees over head, just the clear, dark night. so clear you could easily see the milky way. we were discussing things about space, life, anything us kids would talk about. we got tired of being eaten by the mosquitoes and decided to head inside to go to sleep. everyone, literally, which was an odd first for my past experiences as usually someone was up by the bon fire, but not this night, as they were all asleep. it felt like we were out there for at least an hour, it could have been longer or shorter, but definitely longer than 30 minutes. i remember my brother going to sleep before i did i am pretty sure, as i felt like i was the only one awake. i was watching the ceiling fan above me turn as i was laying on the ground in a sleeping bag in the sun room type extension to the house by the deck. it felt like i just closed my eyes, as i didn't have a clock to reference any time frames, it could have been an hour, it could have only been a minute. sometimes when falling asleep, it feels like it was only 5 minutes but 8 hours went by, so i am not sure how long my eyes were closed. just before reopening them, i had what felt like something\\someone telepathically communicating to me, to look at it. where was it, well that also came with how it felt like i knew which direction it was coming from telling me this. like if you are in the room with someone, you have your back to them, they call you from your back or diagonally from you, and you know where to look, this is how this event was. it was like, look here, or look over here, or look at us\\me something. i don't remember the exact feeling\\statement, but all in all, it called out to me to look at it. i look out the sliding door toward it, where i saw a bright, glowing white sphere, hovering over the lake. it was dead quite, as far as the object is concerned. i remember saying, pretty much nothing, it sits there a few seconds, and it disappears. i remember saying, along the lines of, oh cool, or that's cool, but i remember remarking on how cool it was to see it. it was as if i was with them and they were saying bye, i can't explain it only that it was the most unique of all of my experiences with unexplainable events. so after it blinks out, literally just disappeared, i just laid my head down and went to sleep. i never told anyone as i knew i was young and everyone in my family is so skeptic of anything, that they would never listen to me. it came to me to start talking about it more openly after talking with a co-worker at work in 2003. i reported it to the nuforc then in a hurry and desperation to get my story out while the details of the weekend were still fresh, or at least more fresh than they are now. i know it was a 4th weekend, and i had to reference it within the last two years for the year. besides little details like the date, the actual sighting has remained fresh in my head as if it happened yesterday. it is something i will never forget. recently, doing research, i have found on history channel's site, mapping your sightings tool. there is another sighting, of a 4th of july weekend. they might be the same age as me, but this sighting has more details of this sphere zig-zagging. i really want to know too, if they saw more of my event in my experience. so that is why i am also being really open about this. me personally, along the lines of other unexplainable events, i do believe that there was more to what i consciously know happened. i have my theories, but for what it's worth now, i saw what i saw, what else happens remains to be investigated. after asking for more questions, i do feel i was abducted, but i don't have proof. it will take more time and research, hypnotherapy? i feel that there was more that went on then. i have had 3 psychics, one i worked with, tell me there was something going on but they can't see it because of the state i was in at the time. 3 different people, all not knowing each other, and tell me the same thing. so i will classify as ce4 until someone else says it should be changed. thanks! thanks for your time. sincerely, matthew heiser"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10172.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10172_submitter_file1__lake_panorama.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10172_submitter_file2__sighting.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10172.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10172.html"],"Log Number":"US-04052008-0011","Date of the Event":"07/05/1998 03:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","City":"Panora","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.698854","Date Submitted":"07/05/1998 03:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-94.357392","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.698854,+-94.357392(10172)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10172) map </A>","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Iowa","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Late Night Lake UFO White Sphere","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Panora","There were no other sightings in Panora on or around July 5th 1998","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
