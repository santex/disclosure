I was on the balcony when suddenly a large orange beaming light came across my backyard. I quickly ran inside to tell my girlfriend and her friend to come out and look at it. This is the Second time we saw a UFO 2. I simply looked up 3. We thought it was definitely a UFO. Speculation of Weather Balloon may have been possible, but unlikely due to the shape of a boomerang as came closer. 4. The object slowly moved across the sky and when it reached a certain point it bolted at the speed of light to another part of the sky and made a cyclone noise. 5. Our feeling and reactions were unbelievable, we couldn't believe what we saw however we weren't shocked. We are big believers in UFO's and seen them in the past. We tried to tape it on my new iPhone 4s but it wouldn't work till after the UFO was really far almost like a star."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
