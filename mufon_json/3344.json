{"divs":["sighting detailssighting report: it is now 3:27 am central time on june 15, 2005...the location of my sighting was at the center of my driveway when i first noticed it due to looking up into the sky...i was just outside and had been outside for about 10 minutes...the skies were mostly clear with a few high clouds off towards the south and the temp was around the mid 70s i presume...humidity is low for now but later on after the sun comes up, it ll start to rise along with the temp which is suppose to be in the low 90 s once again.. anyway what i saw tonight was simply something that looked\\resembled a star but it was moving in a due east direction and the rate of speed was fast...guess the best explination i can demonstrait is that if you held up a yard stick so that you could read it, the oject traveled the length of the yard stick (3 ft or 36 inchs) in under 5 seconds...i m not good with math but that s fast in my book...i watched the object, which was basically straight up over my head when i first noticed it, for about 15 to 20 seconds before it faded out of sight...while watching it, i would have to say that it kept a straight due east pattern...i listened for any sort of noise and being the hour of the morning, all was quiet so if it had indeed made a sound, i would of heard it but i heard nothing whatsoever... now i do live just due west of a local small executive airport...the madison county executive airport...wish i knew their number to call to inquire if they picked this object up on their radar since the airport is somewhat busy due to med flight helicopter based there as well as other flight vehicles... wish i could add more but that is about it...hope this does help alittle.."],"Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.851478","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alabama","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.851478,+-86.572215(3344)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3344) map </A>","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3344.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3344.html"],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Meridianville","There were no other sightings in Meridianville on or around June 15th 2005"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-86.572215","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/15/2005 02:51 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/15/2005 02:51 UTC","Summary":"Not Provided","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Meridianville","Case Number":"3344"}
