While walking back towards my house I noticed a bright, white-lit, round object appear over my head and travel in a straight line due east. The object disappeared just short of reaching the tree line. I immediately assumed it was a meteorite, but I realized that it had no tail. I then assumed it to be a satellite or the space station, but it was too large."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"32027","Region":"Illinois","Summary":"Large bright white-lit round object traveling east"}
