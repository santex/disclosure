She heard a loud, rumbling boom about 9:45 PM Sunday. As it turns out, the sound was heard across several states, and several witnesses in the Hampton Roads area have come forward with their descriptions of what they encountered. It has been reported on several of the local news channels, and none of the government agencies have come forward with any information or knowledge of what it was. The meteorogical folks reported no unusual weather or meteors in the area, and NORAD nor NASA have not come forward with any knowledge of space debris coming down. It was suggested that it was the booster rockets from the Soyuz mission, but again, no confirmation from anyone who would certainly know. I hope this gives you a lead to follow up on, and I apologize for not having more info myself. I just thought you folks might find this one of some interest, especially since no government agencies are acknowledging anything."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
