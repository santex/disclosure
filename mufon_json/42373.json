{"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Aulander","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"North Carolina","Summary":"Huge triangle shaped object flies over 5 friends","Latitude":"36.249491","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and i pulled into a wide open field where 3 of our friend were hanging out. When we got there they were all saying they saw something huge fly over a few minutes earlier. To our amazement, either it came back or another was following because it came over again while we all 5 were there. I was triangle, very large, maybe about the size of a football field with reddish orange lights. the brightest was the two at the front with 4 to 6 more lights of the same color but not as bright. It made absolutely no noise at all. i know it was huge because it blacked out large areas of the stars behind it as it passed over. it silently flew out of sight over the horizon. we are all close friends and could not believe what we saw. we stayed up most of the night in total disbelief, talking about it. we have talked about it for years. I have seen things like the lights over phoenix several months after we saw it and was amazed at the similarity. I will never forget it as long as i live! I want to know what we saw that night. is it a real extra terrestrial or secret military that we saw?"],"Date Submitted":"09/08/2012 12:26 UTC","City":"Aulander","Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Date of the Event":"09/15/1997 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09082012-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42373.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42373.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-77.092361","Case Number":"42373","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.249491,+-77.092361(42373)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42373) map </A>"}
