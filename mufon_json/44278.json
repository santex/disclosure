My husky sat on the NE corner and was looking up. I did so and saw a fireball moving in a straight downward angle from the South to the North. It was very pretty and had several colors as it burned, from white to yellow to orange to red to black, leaving a trail. It blinked out about 3 times and then passed between me and some big pine trees. I came into the house told my husband and made this report."]}
