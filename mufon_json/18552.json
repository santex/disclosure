{"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Reddish Color Starlike Object moving from left to right and in circles","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"32.226253","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-110.922909","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were sitting in the back yard relaxing and observing the skies when we both observed what appeared to be a reddish colored starlike object that was moving very erradically. It would move from the left to the right, then up and down, then would occasionally appear to be moving in a circular motion. At times it would appear to stop moving and then after a few seconds it would begin moving again. We observed this for about an hour before we decided to come inside. While we were watching this starlike object we tried to come up with an explanation of what it could be. We are familiar with satellites traveling over our house and well as planes. We concluded that it could not possibly be either ones of these as it was not moving like a plane or satellite. We obeserved other stars in the sky but they were stationary and this one starlike object was the only thing that appeared to be moving."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around August 8th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-08092009-0002","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"18552","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.226253,+-110.922909(18552)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18552) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/08/2009 09:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18552.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18552.html"],"City":"Tucson","Date Submitted":"08/08/2009 09:40 UTC","Tags":"City"}
