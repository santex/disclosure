I decided to take a picture because of the blue background with the Carolina moon and palms. I took the shot then saw this shape. At first I thought I had a smudge on the lense but it was clean. Then I thought it looks like a black Angel or a UFO. As I held the camera we watched it pass across the camera screen at about a jog pace. We kept looking up at the sky and down to the screen. It was on the digital screen but not in the sky. The object continued to move until it moved out of range of my camera. We were so taken off guard that we should have taken more pictures but were too busy trying to figure out what was going on."],"Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Date of the Event":"07/17/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-07202010-0004","City":"Las Vegas","Case Number":"24670","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-115.168926","Region":"Nevada"}
