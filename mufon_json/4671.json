I do night photography. Had this feeling I should take a picture in the same place I got the UFO last fall. Also saw one in the sky about a month ago..no camer on me. Looked like a plane headed for the airport, but brighter and only one light, which I thought was because of a haze or this clouds. At dusk. Then, it took off due north very rapidly and disappeared. The pictures are both different, very small...only about 5-6\" wide, I would guess from the surrounding structures and trees.The first pic is clearer than the second. There is nothing behind it that could have cause this picture. Still have both the original pictures on my camera."],"Region":"Minnesota","Latitude":"45.206623","Longitude":"-93.380716","Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/09/2006 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"4671","Date of the Event":"04/09/2006 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04102006-0004","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.206623,+-93.380716(4671)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4671) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"Got this by accident...picture showed up on computer.
