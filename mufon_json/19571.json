I was driving south on Loop 494 between Royal Crossing Drive and Kingwood Drive, near the entrance to the Homewood Suites Hotel. The entire sky suddenly became brightly lit in a bluish color. This lasted approximately 1 second. Another second passed and then the entire sky was lit again but in the pattern of 2-3 large beams as if the light were coming from the horizon line. This was too large and too bright to have been any type of spotlight. Approximately 5 minutes later I was driving north on Forest Cove drive and a bright blue object (the same shade the lit sky was) flew through the sky in a large arch. The light was traveling very fast. The light seems to blink and then disappeared. I had a passenger in the front seat who also saw both events."],"City":"Houston","Case Number":"19571","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around September 21st 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Hoax","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/21/2009 09:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"30.045051"}
