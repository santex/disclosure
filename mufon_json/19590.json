On the left side of the road is Dennard Mtn. Every Christmas a huge glowing cross is set up as a holiday decoration. Last night, at nearly the same spot we saw an enormous oval shaped object (we think it was oval shaped because we think part of it was behind the mountain) with about 8 evenly spaced lights that were brighter than stadium lights. They lit up the trees below. It looked as if it might be landing. We could only see an arc type shape, but it looked like half of an egg. We got scared and left. During this time there was a terrible electrical thunderstorm and when we returned home @ around midnight, the object was gone."],"Latitude":"35.830354","Summary":"We were driving up 65 N during an intense thurnderstorm when we saw an enormous object over the mountain with lights that lit up the trees below.","Case Number":"19590","Date of the Event":"09/21/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.830354,+-92.55794(19590)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19590) map </A>","City":"Leslie"}
