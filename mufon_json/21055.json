A group of shepherds were tending their sheep in the middle of the night when they saw a star hovering unusually low in the sky and approaching from the east. Obviously they thought this was a bit odd, but what happened next was really weird. Three kings (who were riding camels) came into view following the star which had meanwhile stopped above a nearby stable. The two inhabitants - Joe and Mary, put their heads out and said \"Jesus Christ, what's that?\" The camel riding kings then stopped and asked \"Are you Joe? we've been following this bloody star for weeks so we can give you some gold and stuff, - by the way, are you sure you're the real father of that baby?\" A strange report which as I said may be a hoax, but as some of your readers go for this kind of thing it's one you may wish to bring to their attention.
