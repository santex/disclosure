Howard: Hey there, not sure who to contact without sounding crazy and I'm not crazy. I saw something this morning at 6:12 I walked out to smoke as I do every morning and noticed a very bright white light coming from the south I thought it was an airplane but it was super white and had a kinda fuzziness to it thinking it was my eyes it cleared up and got roundish looking and as it seemed to get closer it got dimmer and started going up quickly and less than 10 seconds later it was gone just straight up at about a 70 degree angle. My name is Henry Henderson my number is (deleted for privacy). I know what I saw and I know I'm not crazy or was seeing things. If you have any info regarding other sightings this morning please let me know I called villa rica police and they had no other calls of this nature. I called them at 6:16 so the time is pretty dead on. I also did the penny at arms length and it was actually a hair smaller than a dime at arms length if that helps. Thanks again and feel free to call me anytime."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/20/2012 02:16 UTC","City":"Villa Rica","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Longitude":"-84.902733","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.738943,+-84.902733(35011)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35011) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35011.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35011.html"],"Region":"Georgia","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere"}
