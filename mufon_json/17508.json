Last night I was just sitting on my back porch here in Chicago when I noticed there were no stars out, except one very bright one. I stared at it for a while and noticed that it was very slowly moving upward. It would then remain stationary for a while, then drift very slowly sideways and then move up a bit more. It was odd because every time that thought to myself, \"that could very well be a spaceship\" it either seemed to sit still or move again, kind of messing with my head. I was really hoping it could be but I couldn't be sure if it was just Venus or Polaris. Hope to see more in the future!
