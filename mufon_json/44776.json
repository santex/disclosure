Our daughter went out to get Vanilla Ice cream to go with the apple pie. She took her grandmother with her. When she arrived, she came running in screaming for us to come outside. When I got outside, I saw five orange-red lights in the sky kind of pulsating and moving in different directions. At first they were pretty close together. We live in a very rural area with almost no noise. Very country. The objects made absolutely no noise whatsoever. They gradually faded out with the exception of one. It went from brightly lit and just disappeared like someone flipped a switch. I immediatley posted on Facebook and checked the various local news stations. Nothing. I checked the local news again the following morning, Christamas morning. Nothing. I Googled and found a site that had reported sightings all around the country. Very weird. We've never experienced anything like this before. Not so much scared but more fascinated."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44776.html"],"Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Five orange-red lights in sky","Source":"MUFON","City":"Clermont","Date Submitted":"12/25/2012 10:50 UTC","Longitude":"-81.772854","Latitude":"28.549445","Log Number":"US-12252012-0013","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.549445,+-81.772854(44776)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44776) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/24/2012 07:03 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"44776","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
