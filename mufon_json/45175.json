It took several minutes in total-both objects were identical and dimmed out identical. The color of object seemed as though it was on fire-both objects moved slowly east to west stopping about straight up- 90'- and just stopped and began to die off till not visible. Hope that helps. Very, very strange-never seen anything like that before in night sky."],"trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around January 12th 2013"],"City":"Washington","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"two seperate events minutes apart-each time object dimmed/got smaller till nothing there","Longitude":"-77.033566","Date Submitted":"01/13/2013 12:44 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"01/12/2013 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None"}
