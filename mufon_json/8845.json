{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI don't live in NYC so I'm not sure specifically where I was but I could ask my father the basic area (cant get ahold of him right now). We were driving along the Hudson (the river that seperates NY and NJ) and I saw a metalic shiny saucer. What struck me about it was that it was flying below some of the buildings. I thought maybe it was a helicoptor but just after I saw one and it wasn't nearly as shiny and it was moving faster and was twice as high. I saw the UFO go behind one building and out the other side and after 10 seconds it was gone. We had passed some trees and it had gone away because I was keeping track of its flight pattern."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01142008-0008","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8845.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8845.html"],"Longitude":"-74.000273","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.718353,+-74.000273(8845)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8845) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg","Date of the Event":"01/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"8845","City":"New York","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around January 10th 2008"],"Region":"New York","Summary":"Seen across the Hudson from NYC.
