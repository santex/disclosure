My sister and I were heading to the house for lunch after playing in our woods. A shadow on the ground startled us and above us about 3-400 feet was this giant Boomerang shaped craft. It was completely silent and as it very slowly moved I stood watching it trying to see everything I could. We were always seeing strange craft over our house with various shapes and sizes. When I saw the shadow I thought there was an airplane going over because we were located almost on the flight path for the Air National Guard. However when I saw craft it was like 2 wings joined together in a V shape without a tail. I knew it couldn't be an airplane because there were no engines, no tail and no control surfaces of any kind in sight. After my little sister ran to the house I stood and watched the craft for about ten minutes or more until it finally disappeared over the trees of the other farm across the road. I told a teacher about the experience a day or so later and discovered several others in the area had seen the very same thing including adults. Towards the end of that week someone from the military was at our school with pictures of an aircraft he called the Flying Wing. Quite a few of the other kids that had seen it decided that was what they had seen but I was not taken in by it and began asking questions. He became quite irritated with me when I asked him where the engines were and he held up the picture again. I told him, \"Not the engines on your picture, the engines on the one I saw.\" After a few more minutes of attempting to dissuade me that what I saw was his flying wing, he told me I had a vivid imagination and turned to leave. I joined the Air Force after I grew up and began then to try to find out what I had seen and made a trip to where they had a decommissioned \"Flying Wing\" to take a good look at it. I noticed the resemblance was quite a lot like what I saw but it had 4 very big, very visible engines as well as a lot of windows. It was also about 6 to 8 times smaller than what I saw. I have been going over this for many, many years trying to find anything it could have been and still have not seen anything quite like that craft and I still search for an explanation. I also search to see anything like some of the others that used to come over our house. Some were shaped like a Cigar with an egg stuck on each end. Some were round, oval and some were even square. Someday I will find the answer and when I do I know it will be something from another place. I watch the night sky and wait; I search the internet for any shape that might fit the specs of what I saw; I just hope they hurry because with my health the way it is I would like to see one again before I die, just to see it again and relive that summer day so very long ago. I don't have any photos as I didn���t have a camera back then and I do not draw very well at all. However, now I carry a camera all of the time and take a lot of pictures of clouds searching for anything standing out that does not belong. If some of the pictures I have taken in the last few months turn out not to be digital glitches, I may be able to report a current sighting."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Wings","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.166137,+-83.524398(12557)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12557) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Boomerang shaped about the size of 2 747's No marking visible.
