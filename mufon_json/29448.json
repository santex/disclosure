As I was walking out I wanted to look up at the night sky and viewed a strange orange star like object which I estimate may have been at an altitude of possibly 20,000ft. or so. This object appeared as one of the regular stars in the sky and then began to move slowly to about a 50 degree level opposed to the horizon. This object then simply disappeared without a trace. No sounds were heard. About a week earlier I had viewed something similar at almost an angle of 90 degrees while laying on my back after a jog. I was looking straight up and viewed a green colored starlike object moving at about the same speed. This object was moving and came to a dead stop straight up at about the same altitude. I remained fixated on this point for about 25 minutes and it did not move from that spot and I decided to go home. It never moved from the position in which it had stopped moving too."],"Region":"Virginia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Hampton","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Hampton","There were no other sightings in Hampton on or around June 8th 2011"],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.032569,+-76.335842(29448)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29448) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
