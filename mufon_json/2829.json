{"Summary":"Cigar-Shaped object hovering on top of Krome Avenu","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting DetailsHello,I was driving south bound on Krome Avenue, between SW 8th street and SW 88thstreet, I have been always interested in unknow things so I always keep lookingaround specially up in the sky, so I looked up to a airplane flying from northto south, which is odd, since they usually fly east and west, so as I looked atthis airplane I noticed something else about 100 feet higher than the airplaneflying from the SE to the NW above the airplane, at first I tought it wasanother airplane, but then I noticed that it had no wings, tail or tail wings,it was silver just like a airplane, but it was shinning in an unusual manner,since it was around 5.30pm, the sun was almost down on the horizon at the west,now the airplane flying from north to south was reflecting the sun on the rightside perfectly, but this object was flying from SE to NW, so it will not be ableto reflect the sun as if the sun was 90 degrees from it, like it did, it seemedlike glowing brightly with a silver color, like I have stated at the beggining,I also carry a camera and binoculars with me at all times, so I decide I had topull over for good look, so as I drove for about 4 minutes, I keep looking atthis object hover right on top of the road, but it was getting behind me as Ikeep going south, so I looked for a place to stop, since this is a one line roadyou can not just stop, so I got to the cement factory entrance, pulled over andgot out of my car with my binoculars..., it was gone, with no sign of itanywhere in the sky, It took less than 30 seconds since I saw it for the lasttime until I got out of the car and looked again, the object was a cigar-shapedbrightly glowing metallic silver, no noise, no windows, no apparent propulsionsystem, just floating there about 90 degrees from the horizon right on top ofthe road, it could not have been a airplane, or I will have seen it fly away,and not dissapear into thin air....Also it seemed to close to the other airplane, I do not think airplanes areallowed to fly about 100 feet from each other..."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2829.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2829.html"],"City":"Kendall","Date Submitted":"01/25/0001 05:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.671674,+-80.355277(2829)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2829) map </A>","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Case Number":"2829","Latitude":"25.671674","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.355277","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Kendall","There were no other sightings in Kendall on or around January 23rd 0001"],"Date of the Event":"01/25/0001 05:30 UTC","Log Number":""}
