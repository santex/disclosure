She told me that the light shinning thru the window was shinning on me and seemed interested in me. She got out of bed and picked me up. the light beam then scanned our backyard. My mom said the object seemed curious of the liquid propane tank in the yard. after a few minutes, the light beam retracted into the object and she said it flew off straight up. My brothers laugh at the story and say I was swapped by aliens at birth. This happened at an Airforce Base."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"48.196964","Log Number":"US-09222008-0017"}
