{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and 5 of my friends were in my back yard having a bonfire. It was about 12:00 at night and we put out the fire because I have to wake up in 5 hours to go bow hunting. As we were walking up my back driveway, my friend dan looked up above the trees and saw the 5 lights. He then told my friend cal and he looked up and pretty much freaked out. This is when we all looked up and were amazed at what we were looking at. We then ran out to the front of my house and went across the street to get a better look. The first thing we did was trying to analyze what we were looking at. My first thought was that they were balloons attached to a line moving back and fourth, but this didnt seem right because the spheres stayed in a perfectly straight line. We watch if for about a half hour just moving left to right. I couldnt tell how far it was off the ground and we compared it to the surrounding stars and it was multiple times bright than any star in the sky. after a while I went inside and my friends stayed outside to watch the ufo. One of my friends brad called some of his friends to come see what we were looking at. They were about 5 minutes from my house on english and frost avenue when the object few from its position across the lake which looked from my house looked like it was above St. paul. So after being in the same area moving right to left the object few slowly towards us over the lake and over my house and as this was happening my friend who was on the phone with his friends told them to pull over and look up because they were on frost avenue. They got out and saw the 5 lights go over them stop, move really fast in one direction and take off. They were freaked out because they thought we were lieing and they were not ready to see what they saw. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I have tired to look up other sightings or pictures of what we saw and I cant find anything. we tried to take pictures with phones and cameras but nothing showed up. we really needed a video camera but we did record the audio of everyone when the object flew over. My friend cal has it recorded on his phone so I couldnt put it on here but hopefully you found this intersting and please contact me if you can help me figure out what we saw."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Maplewood","There were no other sightings in Maplewood on or around October 10th 2009"],"Longitude":"-92.992115","Case Number":"20041","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.955342,+-92.992115(20041)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20041) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/10/2009 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"44.955342","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20041.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20041.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"Minnesota","Summary":"5 spheres in a diagonal line","Date Submitted":"10/20/2009 03:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Maplewood","Log Number":"US-10202009-0005"}
