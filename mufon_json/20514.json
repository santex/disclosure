I thought it was a shooting star. Then it got closer and I thought it was a plane, but it didn't look like any plane I've ever seen. It was boomerang shaped and had six light on the bottom that were all the same color, none of them blinked at all, they were like a faded yellow color, like a light bulb. It was very quiet and I could here it buzzing, it sounded like bees. It was moving at a constant speed, not slow or fast. It was coming from the south and was headed north. I watched for about 2 or 3 minutes and then ran under a canopy for a minute or so and then moved into the garage and I could still hear the buzzing noise. I ran into the house and called my cousin who went outside to look and she didn't see it all. I was very afraid. When I was watching it, I felt mesmerized and at the same time I was thinking it was beautiful and terrifying at the same time."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Object Features":"None","Region":"California","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Boomerrang shaped, 6 lights, same color, moving at constant speed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Firebaugh","There were no other sightings in Firebaugh on or around November 14th 2009"]}
