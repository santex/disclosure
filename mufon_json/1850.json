Then noticed that it couldnt be, because there were2 sources of light. Left room to get glasses, gone when came back. Then, as Istared at the clouds, two large, white lights turned-on (as though by a switch)above clouds again! They were side by side without a lot of distance between. Iwas transfixed for about five minutes or longer, as they were stationary, andtoo big to be anything I could think of. Then the one on the left, withinseconds, reconfigured its shape and was gone-didnt move, just went out. Withinabout 30 seconds, the one on the right-which did not dim or changeshape-blinked-out as well. I returned to the window a number of times in thenext two hours, but saw nothing else. Oh, and as for height, it was within theatmosphere-not near high enough to be a satellite. Never seen anything like it!"],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2002 09:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Portland","Summary":"Two lights above clouds over Willamette River at n","Case Number":"1850"}
