The visibility was exceptionally clear. As I was looking at the stars, I noticed one that was moving side to side in a fast and eratic motion. I then observed approximately 8 other bright starlike objects making similar moves, side to side, up and down and zig zag motions. All of the objects I observed were completely silent. While one of the UFOs remained stationary, I looked through my binoculars and could see that they were round and had red and white lights rotating around the the edge of them. At approximately 12:45am I then observed large V shaped object moving in a northerly direction. This object was at least a half mile in length from the apex of the V to the end sides. It also moved in complete silence and then, I observed approximately 30 red colored round shapes exit from the apex of the triangle and form a line over a mile long directly in front of the triangle. The triangle had two rows of white light on each side of it. The red line of red ball shaped objects had the ends of the line in about 45 degree angles. Both V shaped UFO and red lined UFOs made a coordinated turnd to the west moving at a slow speed. Then the V shaped object just disappeared and the red ball objects continued to move in a westerly direction. On the nights of Apri 5th and 6th I observed the same starlike objects making the same movements. As an ex-pilot and retired police officer, I am certain that these objects were not conventional aircraft. On Apri the 7th while returning to Oklahoma and traveling east on Interstate 40 one of these star like objects stayed to the south of us following us for over an hour. I was able to see very bright white lighted orbs at ground level moving in eratic motions around houses and in some of the tree lines that were less than a mile from the highway. I have a theory as to exactly what it was I saw, but I will only speak to a MUFON investigator on that subject."],"Object Flight Path":"Other"}
