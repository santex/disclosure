Looked up, per usual, the fast pulsating star-like objects were in the sky again. I was beginning to think maybe I was just seeing alot of helicopter traffic, that's when I saw one of the objects stop dead in it's tracks & speed off back in the direction it came from to avoid an actual helicopter. On Monday evening the objects were in the sky flying low & slow. I went to the right side of my house, by the garage, and noticed a very low flying bright light flying towards the house. As the object approached (about a 3 block distance away) it changed from the bright light into a triangle shape with red, green & white lights pulsating around the underbody of the object. The lights did not pulsate on & off from front to back like an airplane or helicopter."],"Longitude":"-74.847864","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/07/2008 07:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Fairless Hills","There was one other sighting in Fairless Hills on or around October 7th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.185964,+-74.847864(12953)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12953) map </A>","Summary":"3 Nights in a row of sightings in Bucks County","City":"Fairless Hills","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"12953","Latitude":"40.185964","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
