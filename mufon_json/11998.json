It looked about 500-700 feet off the ground, hovering over a nearby neighborhood. Tonight was well lit, we had a full moon. And this big circle, hovering in the sky, blocked out clouds and stars. Suddenly, it flew off with unearthly speed, and disappeared into the night sky. There were no lights coming from it, but there was a clear, disc-shaped outline. If I had to guess, I'd say that they were going stealth tactical. That's what our military would do, and, how it would operate."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.697887,+-76.062727(11998)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11998) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","City":"Rising Sun","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11998.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11998.html"],"Log Number":"US-08092008-0004","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Region":"Maryland","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"11/22/2007 10:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Rising Sun","There were no other sightings in Rising Sun on or around November 22nd 2007"],"Tags":"City"}
