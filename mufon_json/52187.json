It made no noise, it just hovered above for a few minutes then it disappeared, flew straight up, no engine noise nothing. The object did not have any marking, wing, rotors, etc., and it was no weather balloon or what have you. I am attaching the pictures I took with my camera, if you zoom into the object it is no airplane. This incident happened around 1300 and lasted for about 20 minutes or so..............at first we thought it was a helo or aircraft, we even thought it was a balloon or a bird but as it got closer we noticed that it was nothing that we have seen before. And no we were not drinking.............."]}
