People were driving on the road, but it was not officially opened. I was in the car with my father and brother. We were traveling south east on Spur 25. It was dark outside and I was absentmindedly staring out of the windshield. Up, very high in the sky, I noticed a small red dot. It was not a bright light; in fact it was not as bright as the stars and I had to concentrate on it to see it. To my surprise, it moved. As I watched it, another red dot went past it. I expanded my field of vision and red dots were everywhere and moving in all directions. I did not see them long enough to determine how many of them there were, or if their movement was organized. The brief time I observed them, their movement was rather chaotic. Some where going in circles, some in arcs - - they reminded me of a colony of insects because there were so many of them and they were all moving. I immediately thought they were under some form of intelligent control because they did not bump into each other, and I immediately thought, they are not from around here. I asked my father and brother if they could see them. My brother could see them, but my father who is color blind, could not see them. I would estimate that the red dots were over the St. Simons Sound, or the south end of St. Simons Island. As we merged onto US 17, our field of vision changed and we could not see them any more. My brother is younger than I am, he would have probably been around 10 at the time of the sighting. I recently asked him if he remembered it and he looked at me as if I had taken leave of my senses and said, ���How could I forget it?���"],"Log Number":"US-03192009-0003","Case Number":"16105","Longitude":"-81.483089","Date of the Event":"11/30/1974 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"31.158163","Summary":"Large group of UFOs observed at a high altitude.","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Brunswick"}
