Would I be able to take photos of a craft in orbit in broad daylight using 36X zoom ? Thanks for your time, Rick Forte"],"Summary":"Bright star-like object very high in clear sky,took 5 photos of object that appears to be a satelite,I think !","City":"Glenolden","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/23/2013 10:57 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"39.90694","Longitude":"-75.277346","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48355.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48355.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/19/2013 12:42 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"48355","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.90694,+-75.277346(48355)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48355) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06232013-0018","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s), Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
