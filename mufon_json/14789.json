I was on my apartment stoop smoking a cigarette when my neighbor, who was just coming home after parking his car in our complex���s lot, called my attention to something around the corner of the building. I moved to share his line of sight and immediately saw an equilateral triangle composed of six red lights. The lights shone at approximately -2.5 magnitude and covered an area of roughly 9 square degrees in the sky. Three lights marked each of the triangle���s corners, and three others were arranged outside around them, forming a larger triangle, equal in proportion and orientation to the inner one. As I watched, the individual points were in motion with respect to each other, but the group appeared to hang motionless in the southwest sky. At this point, the approximate alt-az of the lights was 160���(SSE) by 35��� elevation. I ran inside and retrieved my 6x30 image stabilized binoculars to get a better look. The formation had shifted to an irregular lambda shape of five or six lights when I came back outside. Through the binoculars, the lights appeared as tiny points against a backdrop of clouds illuminated by nearby Morristown. They were clearly below the cloud deck compared to airplanes elsewhere in the sky at the time, and appeared to be separate objects in no way connected by a larger structure. They moved steadily in ascending, lateral, and descending directions in a manner that seemed to display deliberate coordination, but there was no noticeable sound of aircraft. I returned inside again and readied my digital camera after waking my fianc���. By the time I started collecting video, the visible lights had been reduced to three or four and had moved to approximately 130���(SE) by 20��� elevation and the formation covered less than the area of the full moon. By this time, eight minutes had passed from when I originally observed the lights. My fianc��� and I watched them, with two of my neighbors, as they hung low in the southeast sky, flickering in a tiny triangle. They shifted into a straight line before the individual lights began to rapidly descend beyond tree line one by one. One or two could still be seen hovering near the horizon in the distance before they vanished, leaving only a solitary beacon remaining higher up until it abruptly faded. If the lights had not ascended during this event, I would have been fairly certain they were some kind of aviation flares, but I cannot confirm, as I am not familiar with that sort of thing. I have attached two AVI files enhanced to show lower light levels.."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01062009-0003","Latitude":"40.801187","Summary":"Formation of Red Lights","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"14789"}
