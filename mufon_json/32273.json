At first I thought they were traffic lights but then I noticed how high up they were in the sky, and that they were actually quite large and were moving slowly in a straight line. After floating along in that straight line for about 15 minutes they both stopped at exactly the same time, and then shot upwards and disappeared. I immediately felt dizzy and sick to my stomach and had to pull over to throw up."],"City":"Phoenix","Latitude":"33.567978"}
