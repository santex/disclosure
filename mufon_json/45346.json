We all saw this light rise above the trees and start irratically move and then hover. It was pulsing yellow, orange ,and red. It started to move higher and then to the north west and then it was gone from our sight. We saw another one this Sunday the 20th at about the same time but it was faster and moved towards the southwest and became a red star like object before we lost sight of it. This can't be a lantern because it moves against the wind at times and it's way too bright. I saw another one above a plaza last year this time. It was up close and no lantern."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.584315","Date of the Event":"01/13/2013 08:22 UTC","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"01/21/2013 07:24 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-01212013-0007","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Indian Harbour Beach","There were no other sightings in Indian Harbour Beach on or around January 13th 2013"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"28.145455"}
