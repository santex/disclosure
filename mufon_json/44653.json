Right at the end of its path it turned completely glowing white (ascending) shooting straight up into the sky, faster than anything I have seen. This was not an oridinary occurance. It actually changed my aspect on UFO's. It messed with my mind the entire night, I couldn't belieive what I had seen. I felt like peole thought I was crazy. The object came to a stop and went straight up into the sky (or a black hole)."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.568952,+-80.23509(44653)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44653) map </A>","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"12/18/2012 09:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44653.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44653.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Guelph","Summary":"it was changing colors in a straight path then changed completely white shooting strait up into the sky faster than any shooting star i have seen this was not a ordinary thing on a clear night with absolutley nothing in the sky!","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Guelph","There were no other sightings in Guelph on or around December 18th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Egg, Fireball, Flash"}
