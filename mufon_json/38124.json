On December 24, 2011 at 1:34 AM. I was driving North on Hwy 99W in Oregon approximately a mile north of Twin Buttes Dr, Linn County, Oregon. The object in the front resembled an oversized and reversed jet engine the front glowed red. The object was ���cigar��� shaped approximately 30 feet in diameter and 100 -170 feet long. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and made absolutely no noise. I stepped out of my car because I thought the object was going to crash as I exited my car I noted the time on my dash clock. Instead as it approached the hills to the west it turned up into the clouds and disappeared. As I was getting back into my car I noticed a man getting into a small (Ranger type) truck about 100 yards ahead of me, apparently he was reacting to the same thing. The man in the truck and I pulled alongside each other and he asked if I had seen what he had seen. I affirmed his sighting and he left."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.384012,+-123.109814(38124)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38124) map </A>","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-123.109814","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/13/2012 10:12 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Oregon","Summary":"Mysterious object flew directly infront of my car.","Latitude":"44.384012","Log Number":"US-05132012-0019","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"38124","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38124.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38124.html"]}
