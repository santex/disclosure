There was a thick fog with less than 10 feet visibility and it was freezing cold. I was just about to pour a cup of coffee when I started noticing that the fog around me was quickly beginning to disappear and I begun to feels this light warm air coming down on me, like a breeze, which felt like being under a heat pump while its on. I could also smell something, which I have never smelled before or again, it was a very unusual harsh chemical smell. I then looked up and I saw this cigar shaped object, about 80 feet above me. I initially thought that it might be a small aircraft but I quickly realized that it could not have been one as it wasn't moving at all or making any noise. At this point I was pretty scared to the point where I reached for my rifle and proceeded to load it as I feared for my safety. The object was dark in colour and it has these fluorescent lights underneath it, which looked pink. The object was about 100ft long and it was still for the entire time it was above me. I can't really be sure on how long this lasted but my take is that it was between 1 to 2 minutes. When it finally left, it first moved slowly, then increased speed dramatically reaching an altitude of about 650 ft, finally disappeared from my sight. At this point, I couldn't feel the warm air or the smell anymore and the fog quickly returned. The next day I contacted the local airport and asked if there was any traffic in that area at that time and I was told that there was nothing has the weather conditions and visibility where poor for any flight and that all flights where canceled or delayed. About a week later, a newspaper in a town about 150 miles from Venice published a photograph of the same object. Not sure what that thing was but I will never forget what I saw - I did not believe in \"UFOs\" before that night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14197.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14197_submitter_file1__image.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14197.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/31/1981 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Summary":"Cigar shaped UFO close encounter near Venice, Italy 1982.","Region":"Veneto","Weather Factors":"Fog, Heavy","Object Shape":"Cigar","Source":"MUFON"}
