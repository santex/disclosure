They can be witnessed... as long as you are intent on seeing them. I have researched every avenue for confirmation and validation of these objects. The best I can conclude... is that the government will not show any valid evidence of radar confirmation, nor will they address their localized aerial presense... unconditionally. Transparency and validation will only be achieved by means of mass evidence gathering and demand. Keep your eyes and cameras to the sky!
