They are a normal thing at later times of the night and I know they aren't aircraft due to my experience in the aviation field. I was outside smoking a cig and saw a bright light chaging different colors hovering for about 15 minutes in the same spot. I know it wasn't an airplane as it was with out a doubt hovering and the lights were in no way regulation for civilian or military. Towards the end of the event I heard some rustling in the leaves in the school yard that is directly behind my house and a man stepped out dressing in all black. I couldn't see his face due to lack of light but he was just staring at me not moving. I went inside and locked the doors as this was very disturbing. As I went to close the blinds I looked out again and he was not longer there as I had my cell phone in my hand to call the cops. I don't know if this was coincidence or connected but it was pretty unnerving and sent a crazy chill down my spine."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.716213,+-74.004973(45909)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45909) map </A>","Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw Object hovering and then man in black appeared in school yard","Sighting Duration":"00:15:05"}
