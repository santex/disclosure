So low it could have landed, a small object followed. It was like a disk, with a red and white light underneath. The red light was blinking. I heard no sounds until it went over and I watched out the front of my house, It was still tree top level. It was like looking at two ships playing tag with eachother. The sound was loud Whoosing sound. I followed it for about 3 to 5 minutes. My cats were acting really strange I was really excited. I didn't sleep until after the event.
