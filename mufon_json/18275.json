I was looking for a business on google maps and while viewing the photo of the street, I tried zooming for a better view and accidently ended up looking at the sky, where I saw the \"object\". It doesn't appear to be a reflection since a part of it is clearly behind a small cloud. Did not look like any aircraft I'm familiar with. A very curious thing. In case anyone would like to take a look, the address I googled was 3128 Forest Lane, Dallas, TX. I then changed the view to look at the businesses across the street (toward Burlington Coat Factory) and that is where I saw the object in the sky."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/29/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Silver Disc shaped object in photo on Google maps","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18275.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18275.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Farmers Branch","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.934194","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Farmers Branch","There were no other sightings in Farmers Branch on or around July 29th 2007"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07242009-0009","Region":"Texas"}
