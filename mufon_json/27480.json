When this incident occurred my sister brought to my attention a article she read of other people in my town having similar experiences. My mom also saw a UFO cigar shaped directly over our house and while all this was going on my sister who was in Canada for a job project was experiencing all kinds of poltergeist activity which I also have experienced. At one point I was woken to a feeling of 2 beams on my body, one on my hand and the other some where near my stomach which I feel healed me because I was having pain in that hand which I no longer have. While all this was going on I was being followed around by real fancy cars and people, mostly men which seemed to follow me where ever I went. At one point I was chased by a white van. I have experienced dreams of seeing a UFO and feeling panic and hiding. But I have also had a few experiences when I could actually feel a presence and a feeling of total peace and tranquility like they were some how doing something to me to make me feel a good feeling. I remember one missing time experience. During my child hood I had a experience where I had a thought to go out side and when I did I saw a large white light silently floating through the sky. Because of these experiences I'm thinking about going under hypnosis and I'm also interested in meeting with others who have had similar experiences."],"trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Fresno","There were no other sightings in Fresno on or around November 30th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
