But then I noticed another object moving, hundreds of miles from the first object, both seemed to be mirroring one another, moving at the same speed and keeping a precise distance from each other. That in itself was strange, but when they both moved in a jagged, off balanced manner, both in complete and utter sinc with one another, that was really weird. It was as though both objects decided to trip at the same time and in the same manner with precisely the same off balanceness, even though they were hundreds of miles a part. They were two objects because the stars could be seen between them. I watched them both until they were out of site beyond the tree line."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.428231","Log Number":"US-08302009-0006","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Case Number":"18964","Summary":"Two moving objects in night sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"06/15/2009 09:30 UTC","City":"Gravette","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Gravette","There were no other sightings in Gravette on or around June 15th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/15/2009 09:30 UTC"}
