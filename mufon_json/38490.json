They were flying NW to SE. Both object stayed perfectly parallel to each other the whole flight. They blinked with perfect precision. This went on for 6 minutes and then the lights began to circle around one another. The color of the lights was a bright bright white, almost blue white and they were spherical shaped. Someone please, please tell me what this besides a UFO. I'm literally in shock and my daughter is also. We had to come inside at one point because we noticed the lights had stopped and were circling one another and this scared my daughter pretty badly. They circled side to side, over and around, under and over, very quickly but in sync together. You never think that you'll see something like this and every thought that runs through your head ranges from plane jumpers to balloons...THIS WAS NEITHER!!!! The objects made no sound."]}
