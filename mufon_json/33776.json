I didn't know what it could be, so I got up to see what it was. Suddenly, a triangle craft flew over the trees and my house. It was moving slowly, so I was able to watch it for about 2 minutes before it disappeared from sight. It was flying lower than most aircraft. It had a bright white light on each cornor and a pulsing (NOT blinking) red light in the center. It made no noise and didn't emit any exhaust. I don't know what it was, but my belief in the supernormal was comfirmed when I saw it."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in forest hill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"33776","Latitude":"39.585106","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"A triangle craft with a bright white light on each cornor and a pulsating red light in the center.","Date of the Event":"10/27/2011 10:12 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Maryland","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
