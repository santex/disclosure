The sky was clear. There was no reflection of moon light off the object. At first it appeared ghost like. As it got further to the north I went the balcony railing and noticed the object appeared to elongate into a boomerang shaped object before going out of sight. The only other moving object was a commercial aircraft in a down leg approach to DIA for landing."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32692.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32692.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Gost like blob changing to boomerange in distant","Case Number":"32692","Longitude":"-104.910071"}
