At first, I got to thinking perhaps it was a part of the moon, considering there was some intermittent cloud cover amid the still very starry sky. However, given the time of night and the location, that wouldn't probably be remotely possible. I slowed the vehicle down as I drove and observed the rest of the sky and searched for the moon, just in case. Of course, it should have been out and waxing. The light was too orange and too spherical to even be considered the moon. At any rate, couldn't find the moon. Eventually the object in question traveled behind a cloud. We monitored the cloud. However, the light didn't show again, even as the cloud moved. Only other activity that night was a meteor shower, but it was fairly obvious this wasn't that."],"City":"Sherrill","Case Number":"41984","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-08242012-0007","Longitude":"-75.598235","Date Submitted":"08/24/2012 10:12 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sherrill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.07368,+-75.598235(41984)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41984) map </A>","Summary":"Orange orb in night sky","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Latitude":"43.07368"}
