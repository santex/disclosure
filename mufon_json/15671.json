I thought how weird it looked like a car in the sky. We thought it was a plane and seemed to be in the flight path. They lights were low in the sky and were moving slowly. As we drove towards it it seemed to slow then it stopped and hovered above the trees just to the left of the road. It was stationery for at least 10 seconds and we could now distinctly see a triangle shape with 4 lights. 1 at the top and 3 across the bottom of the triangle. We rolled the window down to hear noise but there was none. It took a 90 degree turn towards the east and slowly moved away from us. We kept saying \"What is it?\" We were trying to make sense of it. We turned the car around to get another look and it was gone."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/22/2009 09:45 UTC","Region":"Connecticut","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"2 bright headlights in the sky.
