I first thought it to be a balloon or some such but when it started changing shape and colors thats when I ran to get my camera. I changed from a circle, to a triangle, to a diamond shape very rapidly. It didnt seem to be in any hurry but went from our north to our south in about 5 minutes. We were awe-struck at the object and I called out my wife who also viewed the object with us. We chattered excitedly about it as I took pictures of the object which eventually vanished from our view. It travelled in a very linear path and was definitively NOT a plane, balloon, or blimp. I am attaching photos of the object as the camera saw it and enlarged for ease of view. I can only upload 3 photos but have about 8 photos in all."]}
