I only noticed it for a few seconds before it blinked off. An aircraft giving off a contrail was headed for it. Five to ten seconds after the light went off, the jet quit emitting the contrail, and neither was seen again. Interestingly, the contrail showed the jet had made 3-4 SHARP maneuvers in the sky. I have never before seen angular contrails, as if the jet changed course each time the \"light\" did. From my viewpoint, the contrail showed the jet had turned 60-75 degrees. The contrail length suggests that the jet was in pursuit for 10 minutes; starting from nothing, moving into an arc and finishing with the angular moves. The sun was low in the partly cloudy sky. Visibility was unlimited in the area of interest. The jet itself was never seen, suggesting a great distance. If the jet would have been visible as only a dot, the light would have been 10 times that size. It was extremely bright. I was driving in northwest Houston, the scene was to the southwest."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Date Submitted":"01/13/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"8860","Country":"United States"}
