NO SOUND WAS HEARD SO IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER AND IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE HEARD IF IT WAS ONE. IT WAS POSITIONED ON THE NORTHWESTERN SKY ABOUT 1-2 MILES HIGH. I SPOTTED THIS OBJECT BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT 4 TIMES BIGGER THAN THE BIGGEST STAR AND IT EMITTED A GLOW DUE TO THE MOISTURE PRESENT AT THE TIME. THERE WERE A FEW CLOUDS PRESENT THAT EVENING. I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE SIGHT AND I WAS ABLE TO OBESERVE IT FOR ABOUT A HALF-HOUR BEFORE I HAD TO RESUME WITH MY ACTIVITIES. BESIDES, IT WAS A BIT COLD.
