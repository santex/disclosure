It looked like a cigar with four or five lights. the back light was yellowish gold, then there was a red blinking light, the next light was dark blue and the front light was solid red. it was flying much faster then any plane we have ever seen. It covered the with of the sky in about 5 seconds maybe a couple more but it was very fast. My wife and I were only standing at the back door watching it for less then 10 seconds. when it was gone, Mary and I were left feeling we saw something that we have never seen before. we talked about it for a few minutes, We found this on the internet search, I hope this helps figure out what we saw, If you able to let us know something we would be thankful."]}
