I started to get acrook in my neck so I stood up to stretch. At first I saw nothing. Then a fewseconds later I noticed a flourescent blue-green cloud appear directly above me.At first I was curious, I had never seen an atmospheric condition of this sort.But as the cloud began to grow, I became nervous as I began to think that it maybe radioative in nature. The clouds behavior was exactly like if you were toblow ink into water through a straw. The back door was open and the lights wereon. When I looked in to call my mother and siblings out to come and see, Inoticed that they were all asleep. As I continued to look on, the cloud began todisepate. This was no aroua borialis. Its structure was to well defined, justlike to billowing cloud of the space shuttle during take-off. Eventually thecloud vanished, to my relief, and I was left wondering were 3 hours had goneSince my activites start at 10pm and the cloud disepated after 1am.
