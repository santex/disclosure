This sighting took place within the first half of the tape and was totally silent. I then transfered to my tiny olympus fe360 so I could upload to youtube and show some zoom and edge detection and then to slow it down and zoom to see this object closer.I have the original tape.It was a very short fast sighting yet the sudden complete opposite direction change along with the speed and silence and the brightness of this object was simply amazing. To me this object seemed to be under control."],"Date of the Event":"01/14/2013 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Republic","There were no other sightings in Republic on or around January 14th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON"}
