I had noticed the same light several days before but it was farther away in same direction and location. It reminded me of an object I see every now and then which is usually much higher up and with binoculars there seems to be only lights. This time it was heading in my direction so I slowed to watch it. The light it had was much brighter than most aircraft and as I watched its path from east to west then turned south the light dimmed to almost off. At this point it was near to overhead and it seemed to appear like a wing with lights on each end. I was a little excited because I was getting to see this object up closer than before I also kept looking over my shoulder trying to get a good look at it. I stopped at a gas station near by and lost sight of it behind some trees."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change"}
