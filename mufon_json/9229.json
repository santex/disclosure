{"Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy roommate called me outside while he was smoking a cigarette. When I stepped out on to the porch, I saw a glowing red orb traveling across the sky from east to west. This aircraft was completely silent. I watched in amazement for a short time,; then it changed directions to north north-west, and increased to a speed that i've never seen any aircraft travel. It quickly disappeared from sight. What is also interesting is that about the time it changed directions, I saw another aircraft, which looked military, appear from the south and seemed as if it were following the \"orb\". While in the service I was stationed at the largest Marine air-base which is located in Yuma, AZ. I have seen lots of aircraft, but this was completely unexplainable."],"Date of the Event":"01/06/2008 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-124.07546","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-01242008-0029","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.873217,+-124.07546(9229)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9229) map </A>","Summary":"Glowing red Orb w/ transparent ring around it.","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"9229","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.873217","Object Shape":"Circle","Date Submitted":"01/06/2008 09:30 UTC","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","City":"Arcata","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Arcata","There were no other sightings in Arcata on or around January 6th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9229.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9229.html"]}
