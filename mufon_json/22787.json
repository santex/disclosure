I pointed out the \"gold\" one and she said it was a plane because it was moving. At first I didn't see it move but as I stared at it- it started to move from side to side. It would be really still then it would glide again. As I looked around there were about 10 of them things in the sky all doing the same thing. I called my neighbor across the street. They came out and were all stunned.(as was I)I guess I know why all the dogs bark at night now.It's been over an hour ago and they are still up in the sky. Two of them look like they were playing tag. I'm completely creeped and probably will not sleep tonight!"]}
