We were having a campfire in our backyard and suddenly a shooting star, almost as bright as the north star passed by. Then maybe 3 minutes , at most , passed by and then I see 3 things in the air. They were white and were \" flying \" At first I thought they were birds, because they were shaped like one but as they got closer and flew overhead yo u could see that they were flying ABOVE the clouds. And you could tell they weren't birds by they way it was flying. It was more of ripple than anything but it had something like wings. They were very bright also. They weren't planes ethier because planes don't travel in 3. Also they weren't birds because they were way overhead, and they weren't military ( ANYTHING ) because I checked, they weren't doing anything in the air. Their have been SO many sightings of UFO's in the Myrtle Beach area.... I know this is a long status but, whatever I had to share :)"],"trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There was one other sighting in Myrtle Beach on or around August 6th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.630263,+-78.969544(41496)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41496) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/06/2012 09:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/06/2012 11:07 UTC","Summary":"3 white bird almost like UFO's","Case Number":"41496","Log Number":"US-08062012-0029","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Myrtle Beach","Object Features":"Wings","Longitude":"-78.969544","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"South Carolina","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Star-like, Teardrop, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41496.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41496.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
