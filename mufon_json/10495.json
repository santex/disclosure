I would describe the sound as loud enough to grab my attention and make me look up. The sound was not steady, but alternating between quiet and loud. I looked up and saw a glowing yellowish light flying over a row of townhomes behind my house. The light had a yellow glow and was ovalish in shape. As the light flew over the homes and out of view, I noticed that all of the lights in a couple of the nearby homes turned on, more or less around the same time. It was at this time that the sound faded away. The whole event happened very fast in a timespan of about 4 seconds."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10495.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10495.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10495.html"]}
