I was called out to the back yard by my mother and father that are visiting. As I came out to look at what they were talking about I saw a dark object hovering motionless in the sky. I immediately thought to myself that this object should not be in the sky and what could this possible be? I ran in and grabbed my camera and started to film. Because of the time of day and the fact the this sun was going down it was very hard to focus on. I tracked it in the sky as long as I could before it got too dark."],"Log Number":"US-02262012-0007","Latitude":"33.371574","Summary":"Solid object that was very dark.
