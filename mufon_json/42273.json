I put her to bed around 10:40 then i went outside to smoke a cigarett i looked up and seen a bright light flying through the sky as it went by i couldnt beleive what i was seeing. it seemed to be the size of a large airplane and appeared to be completely engoulfed in flames yet there was no trail behind it and no sound. it flew from east to west i lost sight of it because of the large trees i jumped on the railing of my deck to get a better look but the trees were to big and i couldnt see it anymore. i felt really excited and i wish i could have gotten a picture but i did not have my camera with me. this was something i have never expereinced before and i felt that i needed to report it in hope that maybe someone else seen it too."],"City":"Keego Harbor","Longitude":"-83.343435","Case Number":"42273","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON"}
