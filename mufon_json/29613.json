{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking a series of pictures of a storm coming from the west of my apartment. I have a nice view and decided to start capturing some scenes of the sunsets and the storms that I get to see. So this was a great moment to catch the sun setting in the west as a storm was encroaching. The sun was bright and when I took the picture my eyes where having a hard time seeing ...because of the glare of the sun. So I took the picture. As I pulled my eyes away from the camera phone I began to see lights dancing in the clouds...a flash here and another there. I thought perhaps it was just my eyes acting up from the intense sun...I thought I was getting sun flashes in my eyes. I continued to watch for a period of perhaps 4 min, and kept seeing flashes...thinking . \"boy I really screwed up my eyes with that picture.\" I went back into the apartment never thinking anything of it. Anyhow, I captured something interesting...and I have other pictures of interest."],"Date Submitted":"06/18/2011 11:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"29613","Longitude":"-71.992287","Region":"Massachusetts","Log Number":"US-06182011-0014","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.243968,+-71.992287(29613)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29613) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Spencer","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Spencer","Summary":"Taking pictures of storm coming in.","Latitude":"42.243968","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/11/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29613.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29613_submitter_file1__Photo06011902.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29613.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
