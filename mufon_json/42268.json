The lights were fairly small making them seem very high up. Soundless. I was slightly perplexed, but I knew it was out of the ordinary and lately we've met a neighbor who lives right on the lake who have been seeing orange orbs over the lake (which I've heard of before as another friend living on the lake has reported the same thing). One friend went to look and saw the orbs just a few nights ago, I went to meet him and they were gone, but there is the feeling that they are allowing themselves to be seen more, that's what I thought when i saw the 3 going thru the sky last night."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.234052,+-77.545825(42268)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42268) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-09032012-0015"}
