It looked like a black army helicopter. It was very very loud and sounded like it was going to crash actually. Then my dog wanted out and I was trying to get back to sleep and was staring out my window to the south and there was a very low and very fast flying white ball of light. It was not falling but streaking over my neighbors house and off to the east. Too fast to film! But I have been seeing these very often. They are not drones because they go so fast."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"34078","Latitude":"33.978542","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around December 16th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-12172011-0012","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.978542,+-118.455506(34078)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34078) map </A>","Summary":"Fast White Fireball Flying in a Straight Line FAST AND LOW!","City":"Los Angeles","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
