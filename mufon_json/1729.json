primary witness), her twochildren, and her niece. i was put in contact with the primary witness throughbob schultz, of minnesota mufon, who is a mutual friend. i then contacted herand interviewed her and her two children. the fourth witness (the niece) nowresides in germany. i have mailed her a sighting form, but have not yetreceived a response. i have therefore decided to file this report with thethree witnesses only, to be updated if\\when i obtain the fourth witness report.witness descriptions:the witnesses are a mother, her niece and her two daughters,. at the time ofthe sighting, the mother was age 33, the daughters were ages 6 and 7, and theniece was age 15. all witnesses describe their health and hearing as excellent. the mother hasminor visual astigmatism and wears glasses, correcting her vision to 20\\20. shewas wearing her glasses at the time of the sighting. the vision of all othersis either uncorrected 20\\20 or correctable to 20\\20. there do not appear to beany health effects related to the sighting.the mother is very interested in both ufo and metaphysical topics. the familyhas indicated no other major ufo-related or anomalous experiences. however, themother has indicated one other possible sighting by both her and her husband.sighting account:the witnesses were driving to their family cabin in central, minnesota, and weretraveling west bound, in their car at about 9pm cdt, on august 8, 2000. theywere approximately three miles west of the town of howard lake, minnesota, oncounty hwy 13 (detour of us hwy 12). the mother was driving, her 15 year oldniece was in the front passenger seat, and her two daughters were in the backseat. she noted that the road was busier than usual, and that traffic wasmoving slowly on this detour routethe mother observed what seemed to be lights ahead of them, apparently aiming atthem. she initially felt that they seemed like aircraft, and also observed thatthere was no noise present, beyond that from the cars travel. curious, sheslowed the car and observed them. as they approached, she noticed that what waspreviously visible only as lights, now resolved into disks. she noted that the car in front of theirs had pulled over to the side of theroad, and that other cars seemed to have slowed down as well. she pulled theircar off to the side of the road as well, and opened the car windows to watch theobjects. nobody said anything as they watched the objects approach. they sawthe object(s) come from the west (anti-parallel to their path), then swoop tothe south, away from the road, passing behind nearby trees and out of sight.as they watched, the mother initially thought that they were some form ofexperimental craft, and then decided that they had to be unidentified objects. once she realized that the objects were ufos, she describes her reaction as oneof amazement. she estimated that the objects moved at approximately the speed of cars on thehighway, somewhat faster than the cars in the oncoming lane [cl note: 60 +\\- 10mph?]. she noted that although passing quite close to them, the objectsappeared to make no noise. she notes that there were no other aircraft visibleduring the time of the sighting. at closest approach, the objects were on theorder of one or so blocks distant from them. once the lights were lost behind the trees, they resumed driving, pulling outonto the road. at this time, the other cars that had either pulled off orbriefly slowed down now began to resume their normal speed.the witnesses arrived at their cabin at the expected time, indicating that noapparent missing time occurred [cl note: see update at end of investigatorcomments].object description:the mother and her niece, both in the front seat observed three objects (note:the children in the back seat both describe seeing only one object) travelingabout 70 feet above the ground. their movement appeared to be smooth toswooping, as they shifted their path to the south. there was no apparentrotation to the objects, with two bright lights on each object always pointingin their direction of travel. they appeared to be dark metallic with a lighterturquoise color to their central region. the objects moved in a triangular formation, with one object being lower, andthe other two being slightly above. the lower object was about 70 feet abovethe ground.mothers description of objects size: about 30 - 40 m in diameter. description by daughters:each of the daughters observed only one object. the six year old daughter wasin the left seat (closest to the object), looking out the rear window. [clnote: she indicated she was on the right, but this was as looking backwards].the six-year old daughter described the size of the object as about the size ofthe moon [cl note: moon size is often overestimated, suggesting that these were prettylarge objects - cl est.: apparent moon width due to optical illusion is oftensubjectively given as two fingers width at arms length]. the seven year old daughter was in the right seat, also looking backwards outthe rear window. she described the object as being round, gray in color, with red lights on theside and non-blinking green lights in the interior. there was a rectangularfeature in the center which glowed with a light green color. this witness described the object as being \"bigger than an airplane, onlyround.\" cl note: it is notable that the daughters each observed only one object, whilethe mother observed three. they felt that this might have been due to the twoupper objects being obscured from the daughters view by the car roof. bothdaughters and the mother each drew slightly differing depictions of theobject(s), with somewhat different lighting configurations, etc. however theoverall configuration of the object as seen by all was similar in all cases."],"Summary":"Wright County Mult Wit Close Flyby - Aug 1999 [re","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.060797,+-94.073309(1729)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1729) map </A>","Region":"Minnesota","City":"Howard Lake","Case Number":"1729"}
