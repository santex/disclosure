We were not paying much attention to the sky but I noticed there was (what I first thought) a plane heading across my lower view of the sky and the light that it was emitting was not blinking in an orderly fashion as a plane normally does. Instead it would have long pauses between some blinks and other erratic behavior. We continued to watch it as it became apparent that it was not your typical aircraft. It began doing some pretty crazy maneuvers...changing course abruptly but gracefully, hovering, etc. It ascended below our line of sight and ascended a number of times. Our last glance was when it descended below our line of sight one last time and we did not see it pick back up. I would love to know what this was so please direct me to where I might get some answers and also alert me to other people who may have reported this."],"Case Number":"31175","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Escondido","There were no other sightings in Escondido on or around August 25th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"08/26/2011 01:17 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.121607,+-117.083251(31175)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31175) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/25/2011 09:30 UTC"}
