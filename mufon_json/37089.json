No clouds super clear sky. I followed a plane approaching LAX and behind I noticed 3 bright dots circling behind the tail of the plane. I thought at first they were birds but realized too far up for birds plus the way they moved and circled each other. Birds I say later did not have the same round shape. They were real small but on such a clear sky I could see them. They disappeared... I later looked up (10 min. later) and I saw a star in the sky. at first I said hey looks like venus but realized it could not be. I was looking northbound. As I looked west I saw another bright star in the sky. I realized there were two objects motionless in the sky. I brought my daughter's attention to it and we looked at them for a few minutes. We could see balloons pass in the sky and see the difference. These bright objects did not move. After a 10 min. we looked again and the objects were gone. And that is what I saw. There were objects in the California sky."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37089.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37089.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Whittier","Date of the Event":"04/01/2012 10:30 UTC","Case Number":"37089","Summary":"saw two groups, two stationary and three swirling around","Date Submitted":"04/03/2012 01:09 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
