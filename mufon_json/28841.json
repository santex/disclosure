I started to look out the window to check out the weather. All of a sudden a shiny object caught my eye. I decided to keep looking at it. I stared at it for about five minutes and then i showed it to my girlfriend. We stared at it for about a minute or so. I asked my girlfriend to keep an eye on it while i went to the car to get the camera. I came back, and it was still there. I took three pictures of the object. The object came from the north and went south. It moved very slowly, then it stopped for a bit. Then it continued going south. And i lost track of it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/27/2011 06:31 UTC","Case Number":"28841","Log Number":"US-04272011-0013","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","City":"Pomona","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
