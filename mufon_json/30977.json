We both had time to stand up and turn around and watch it fall, to us it looked like it hit the earth somewhere in the mountain, it looked similar to a falling star, however it was green in the middle and it didn't just go out like a meteor, we actually saw it falling down all the way and the light didn't go out. We both actually waited to hear or see some type of explosion or feel something. Then I thought I saw an airplane in the same area a few minutes after we saw the object."],"Tags":"City","City":"Darrington","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Region":"Washington","Longitude":"-121.624279","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Darrington","There were no other sightings in Darrington on or around August 17th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"08/17/2011 01:30 UTC","Summary":"Bright Falling Object","Case Number":"30977","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30977.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30977.html"]}
