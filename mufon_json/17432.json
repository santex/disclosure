I went out and witnessed the moving object pulse bright and fade then slowly fade away. He said it had pulsed and faded once already It was pure white and was quite bright at peak magnitude. It appeared to be climbing in elevation. Star sized in appearance. It was moving north, north west somewhat towards the setting sun when it faded and disappeared. I do not believe it was reflecting light from the sun it appeared to be self luminous. Stars where not yet visible in the sky, the sun set about 30-45 before sighting. horizon was still fairly bright. Object did not change trajectory as some do, it just went in a strait line."],"Latitude":"46.58185","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17432.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17432.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Napavine","There were no other sightings in Napavine on or around June 11th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/11/2009 09:52 UTC","Case Number":"17432","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.58185,+-122.901298(17432)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17432) map </A>","Summary":"Light in sky moving south to north slowly pulsed very bright twice then faded and disappeared, apparently increasing in altitude/distance (climbing).","City":"Napavine","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None, Light"}
