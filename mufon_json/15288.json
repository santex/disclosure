(if it had been daylight, i���d say it looked like a long, large jet-trail���going straight down!) as i noted the object had been in one location for a while now, i quickly went to the living room and opened the blinds and was relieved to still be able to see it. the view from the bedroom had been better, so i went back and as i was watching it, 2 very long, diffused looking white lights shot out horizontally (one to the left, one to the right of the object) again lasting about 2 seconds. there had been no movement of the object now for a number of minutes. about 2 minutes later, the 2 horizontal lights came on for about 2 seconds again! then, all of the lights just disappeared."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Highlands Ranch","There were no other sightings in Highlands Ranch on or around January 3rd 2009"],"Date Submitted":"01/03/2009 05:42 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.545634,+-104.960866(15288)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15288) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering,Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"15288","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/03/2009 05:42 UTC","Summary":"SW Highlands Ranch, CO 05:42 sighting of brilliant \"falling\" white light that STOPPED mid-sky & became horizontal strobe lit UFO...","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.545634","Longitude":"-104.960866","Region":"Colorado","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Highlands Ranch","Log Number":"US-02032009-0011","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Star-like, Unknown"}
