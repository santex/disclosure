{"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I were driving from Durango, Colorado to Aztec, New Mexico on Sunday, March 9, 2008. We both knew that San Juan County, NM has been a hotbed for UFO activity. As we were returning to Durango northbound on US Highway 550 between Aztec and the New Mexico-Colorado border, we were listening to my friend's MP3 player in the car. All of a sudden, we heard a \"whump whump whump\" sound that persisted for approximately five minutes. We determined that the problem was not with the speakers or the integrity of the MP3 files, as everything worked just fine after about five minutes. We did not see any objects in the sky, though the type of interference led us to suspect UFO activity in the area. While it is possible that this did not occur from UFO activity, it was certainly some unexplained interference."],"Region":"New Mexico","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9915.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9915.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.822226,+-107.992846(9915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9915) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03122008-0004","Case Number":"9915","Latitude":"36.822226","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Aztec","There were no other sightings in Aztec on or around March 9th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/09/2008 07:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-107.992846","City":"Aztec","Summary":"Unknown audio interference","Date of the Event":"03/09/2008 07:00 UTC"}
