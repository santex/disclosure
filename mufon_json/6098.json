They were touring up the coast on the way to Washington state. Yesterday while rearranging her photos on the computer I happened to notice something in the background of a photo (attached) showing her sitting on a wall with Mount St. Helens in the background. Being her typical self, she simply blows it off, neither of them having noticed anything at the time. She doesn't recall any details as to exact time or place except that it was somewhere along a highway. However, I was able to match the view and angle in the photo with Google Earth and I think it was taken at the Elk Rock lookout on Spirit Lake Memorial Highway (504). I've guesstimated the time as sometime around 1-2PM, probably closer to 1 PM. I've tried zooming in on the object but still get no positive recognition, although there are faint highlights of possible attachments or appendages visible at relatively high zoom before it gets totally fuzzy. Unfortunately, it was not a high-resolution camera. While it is probably just an airplane caught at an unusual angle, I thought it worth bringing to your attention. Have a nice day."],"Summary":"short cigar-like object in photo background","Case Number":"6098","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
