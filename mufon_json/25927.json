The first thing I noticed is that there were ALOT of visible stars that night...were in the city we shouldnt see so many of them. Then suddenly I look to the horizon and see a \"star\" flashin green, blue white red...I suddenly think its a plane or it could be the helipad at the hospital which is in that direction. we eliminate the plane as the object is hovering and slowly gaining altitude. We also eliminate the helipad as the helipad does not flash green. I then ask my cousin to view the object and it starts saying its a plane its a plane its a plane and as soon as he said it it started showing MORE colors. The colors were purple, pink, white, red, blue, green, magenta, yellow, It was a awesome display of colors. By my knowledge and location I believe the object was towards lake michigan hopefully some other people viewed this object and caught it on tape. The object staying hovering for awhile I went inside and the object was still there."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.043762,+-87.899444(25927)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25927) map </A>","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Milwaukee","There were no other sightings in Milwaukee on or around October 14th 2010"],"Longitude":"-87.899444","Date of the Event":"10/14/2010 02:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25927.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25927.html"],"City":"Milwaukee"}
