One of the objects took on a more western heading and I lost sight of it but the other remained in view for a few minutes before I was out of viewing range. At first I thought it was just a Jet but after watching it for a while I could tell that it was not moving like a jet at all but it seemed to be travelling at a slower rate of speed. Also, it was leaving no contrail whatsoever and it appeared to be at a similar altitude as what you expect a jet to be at. The object appeared to round or its reflection would lead to that assumption. One thing I know is that it was not a commercial jet airliner. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Again, it rate of travel was unlike anything I have ever seen. eerie to say the least."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.202167,+-85.38462(20813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20813) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Muncie","Longitude":"-85.38462","Latitude":"40.202167"}
