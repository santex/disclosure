I saw a silver oval metalic, with a very shinny surface. I actually stared at it for 2 minutes and then it shot straight up into space. When I first noticed it I though it was an airplane and I though to myself it doesn't have wings, it dosen't have propellers and it didn't make any sound at all. So I realized I was looking at a UFO. It was hovering right over me. It was about as high as the airplanes fly in this area. It wasn't anything I had ever seen before...It was definitely not a plane, a baloon or a helicopter. I felt like I was drawn to it...it was kind of like a magnetic feeling of energy. I was relaxed and found it very interesting.."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"I went outside to get my mail and I was walking towards my mailbox and I turned around and looked up.","Case Number":"9416"}
