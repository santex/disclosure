I was taking pictures of a weird cloud formation to the east and upon review of the picture I saw a black anomaly located in the upper right hand corner. The picture was captured while driving on a iPhone 5. The picture was taken through the windshield going about 70mph. I did not see the object. I really do not believe its a true UFO, and I think it's a possible camera anomaly and I am trying to debunk it first."],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around February 25th 2013"],"Longitude":"-118.218639","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/25/2013 05:30 UTC","Summary":"Found in picture that I took"}
