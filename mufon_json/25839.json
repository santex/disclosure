I originally thought it may be a mylar ballon or weather ballon but it seemed too high and traveling too fast for those objects I had the impreesion it was under power not just floating by, but no noise after it passed and no contrail which confused me. I wondered if it is possible to see a satelitte in the daytime because i have seen them at night and that was the way it appeared to be moving to me i did not have time to get camera or binoculars"],"Latitude":"43.172298","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25839.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25839.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.172298,+-73.32761(25839)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25839) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/12/2010 11:33 UTC","Case Number":"25839","City":"Salem","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Date of the Event":"10/08/2010 04:28 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-73.32761","Country":"United States","Summary":"circular object passed overhead from ssw to nne direction","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around October 8th 2010"]}
