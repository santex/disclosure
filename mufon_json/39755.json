They were round with a yeollow light all the way around it with a orange hew off the yellow light of ships. There was a dome at top also lighted. We noticed it was hovering for a few minutes, then shoot off moving closer to us, then they both hovered again... one then very slowly disappeared into the clouds then the second one did after that... You could continue to see the light under the clouds for most of the night. Tonight you can still see the glowing under some clouds but not sure if it is the same two ships from last night. We have never been alien theorists. This however made much more of a believer out of Rick and myself. We thought we should report this somewhere we believe our neighbors also show them from their backyard. Though we have not spoken to them still of sorts in shock. Makes on not feel as safe. Those ships were massive in size... there is no way those were anything like ours we use in our world. We just do not have anything that huge, and they were NOT solar flares either... We would like to know if anyone else reported this or if anyone has an idea exactly what we saw in our local air space??? Thanks for any help you can offer."],"Date of the Event":"06/22/2012 10:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06242012-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Iowa","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39755.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39755.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.98432,+-91.663463(39755)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39755) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Cedar Rapids","Object Shape":"Circle, Saturn-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
