I was looking at the constellation Orion when below and to the right I spotted two red dots traveling at a northwesterly direction. I would estimate that they were traveling at an altitude of about 10,000 ft. I am uncertain about the speed, but it was certainly too slow for meteors. They were then obscured by a small cloud, and did not reappear on the other side. My fist thought was that it was a plane, however the lights were solid, not blinking, and there was absolutely NO sound. In retrospect, I am confident that what I saw was not a plane, meteor, or space junk."],"Case Number":"28057","Date Submitted":"03/03/2011 12:21 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.774875","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle, Other","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Log Number":"US-03032011-0001","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Baker City","There were no other sightings in Baker City on or around March 2nd 2011"],"Tags":"City","City":"Baker City","Region":"Oregon"}
