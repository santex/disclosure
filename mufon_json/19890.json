On the porch 2 nights ago I noticed a blinking light in the sky that resembled a star. The difference is that the lights change colors. This is the third night that we saw the light. It stays in the same position. Air traffic flies by, but it stays stationary. We got the binoculars out and you can see the lights, blue, red, maybe green also. Its above the 29 palms base. If you have someone in the area, look now and you will see it. Three days and counting.
