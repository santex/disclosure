I was watching a satellite glide across the night sky when i noticed a bright, star like object floating across the sky. It wasn't flashing, it was solid white. then another one followed behind it. you could tell that they where pretty high, but still the brightest thing in the sky by far. We watched them for 4 or 5 minuets, we where all so mesmerized by it, we hit a group of small rocks, sticking out of the water. then, one by one, they faded away."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"19195","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19195.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19195.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/09/2009 08:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Latitude":"45.459486","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
