We were watching it because it was so bright and was not moving at all. I got my binoculars and a camera and we started to really watch it. I started taking pictures and this object started to change shapes. When it was round, we could see that the inside was fire engine red. If you zoom in on the pictures you can see little black objects that look as if they are heading towards this object. We didn't see the black objects until I zoomed in on the pictures. After about 4-5 hours of watching this object that never moved, just changed shapes, it appeared that a beam of light (like a flashlight beam) came out of the bottom and then it just disappeared. My pictures came out very well. I have a friend who was driving home around 5:)) p.m. and spotted this same object. He managed to get one picture on his cell phone."]}
