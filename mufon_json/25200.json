He estimated the hovering disc to be 30-35 degrees abv horizon, at an altitude of 5-10K AGL. The disc was motionless, but due to the trees lining the street, the driver was unable to visually acquire the sighting. Once the car had been parked, they did a complete 360-degree scan of the sky, but the disc was no longer visible. The entire sighting lasted less than a minute on a clear blue sky, bright sunny day. Witness estimated the size of the disc at arm's length as the size of the tip of a writing pen, and approximate location over Jackson Morrow Park on the extreme south end of town. They phoned me, the SSD for the region, to get the sighting posted ASAP so that others might see it."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
