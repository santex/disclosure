I saw what seemed to be a BRIGHT orange star, at first. Then it started to travel what looked like straight down, (resembling a meteor or asteroid) and had a tail or vapor trail. It made some strange 90 degree turns at high rates of speed and continued this behavior for at least two hours. It looked like it was it was somewhere around Edwards AFB which makes me just a little skeptical but still i dont know of a human occupied craft that could perform such maneuvers. Please right me back with a response or suggestion on what this might be. Thank you Cwalkwthme@aol.com (P.S.--Shortly after first observing the object military aircraft were seen flying directly over my house, my GF and I,step daughter and sister in law all observed this event for about 2 hours"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/12/2005 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"4016","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4016.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4016.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Really fast star?","Log Number":"US-10212005-0008","Country":"United States","Region":"California","trends":[]}
