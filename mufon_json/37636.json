{"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI spent 22 years in the Navy and when I got out I had a clean bill of health and I didn't have this object that is under the skin in my left knee, all of a sudden one day I go to get x-rays of my knees and noticed this strange object in my left knee. I'm 58 yrs old and don't do things where I would fall and have something embed itself in my knee, I would have remembered that. I can't remember any event where this would have happened. I have included the photos of the x-rays for you to see"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown, N/A","Log Number":"US-04212012-0013","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37636.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37636_submitter_file1__2012-04-2018.31.11.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37636_submitter_file2__2012-04-2018.35.11.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37636_submitter_file3__2012-04-2018.30.44.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37636.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"N/A","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around February 1st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"04/21/2012 05:17 UTC","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/01/2010 09:00 UTC","Latitude":"36.117726","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.117726,+-115.168996(37636)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37636) map </A>","City":"Las Vegas","Case Number":"37636","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Nevada","Longitude":"-115.168996","Summary":"Implant In Left Knee"}
