{"Longitude":"-0.435093","divs":["Sighting DetailsDaughter and myself were driving downn main rd and to the left of us in paddock was a VERY bright red orb? I always keep my eye on the rd but something made me look out my daughters window. It was very low in the paddock which is hilly, very grey overcast stormy day. My daughter was bewildered but made me feel excited, something so close! Had to look back to the rd and it just vanished."],"Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Beverley","Date Submitted":"02/16/2013 08:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date of the Event":"10/18/2012 04:08 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"AU-02162013-0008","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Summary":"bright red light seen in paddock","Country":"United Kingdom","Region":"England","Latitude":"53.841963","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45730.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.841963,+-0.435093(45730)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45730) map </A>","Case Number":"45730","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Beverley","There were no other sightings in Beverley on or around October 18th 2012"]}
