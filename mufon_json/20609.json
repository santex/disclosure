Since I have been seeing these light balls falling from the sky on a regular basis I was looking for them again. I do not report all of them because at first I thought they may be falling stars but the sky is not that clear. However last night the one I saw amazed me so I had to report it. It came out of nowhere like they usually do but this one was very large and very low. It was just above my telephone pole. It was a golden ball the size of a basketball and was coming from the east of my neighbors back yard headed west towards the ocean. It seemed to be just above the high line wires and was not a falling star because it was flying parallel to the flight path and had a golden steamer. The way it flew was in a roller coaster manner and then went about 1,000 feet and just disappeared. The weird thing is that it was not headed downwards like a comet or falling star. I was by myself and could not get my camera in time because it lasted about 7 seconds and I was glued to the sight of it. Also the fact that I am seeing these so often. I am considering putting a web cam up now."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20609.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"11/19/2009 10:38 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.785241,+-119.415102(20609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20609) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/18/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Golden Light ball with streamer","Log Number":"US-11192009-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-119.415102","Country":"United States","Case Number":"20609","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
