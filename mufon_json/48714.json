I observed a very brilliant bright light in the sky. It seemed to follow a SW to NE path. It was sighted NW of my home. Object did not resemble any kind of aircraft. No normal navigation or flashing strobes. Just very bright object. Seen by all 3 of us. I saw same object 4 separate times over a 20 min time. Object followed same straight line path and area in the sky, maybe 15 to 20 miles away. Each time, I would loose sight of object in trees behind my house. I am a retired veteran with aviation experience and I felt concerned that I could not identify this object."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Plainfield","There were no other sightings in Plainfield on or around July 5th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.618885","City":"Plainfield","Country":"United States","Case Number":"48714","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/05/2013 09:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"07/06/2013 12:24 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Bright orange object sighted at dusk","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.618885,+-88.198909(48714)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48714) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07062013-0002","Source":"MUFON"}
