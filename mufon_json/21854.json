{"divs":["Sighting Detailshello this took place in warren, Ohio in 1974 to 1976 not sure the year but it was around that time. my best friend John lucia and I was playing basket ball near my house and at the time there was alot UFOS going on in this town.anyway while we were playing ball I stop and look up above my house across the street I stop playing and saw two very big! very BIG!!circle disc ships in the air and not moving maybe moving very slow they were side by side making no noise at all. I ask my friend about it and he said nothing just looking at each other than we just start playing again. I do remember this that john said ohh my god look the time I need to go supper is waiting and I thought we just started to play how could time go soo fast. keep this in mind we were only kids about 15 years old. would love to find my friend and ask him about what happen. I really dont think the UFO took us BUT!! WHERE DID TIME WENT?
