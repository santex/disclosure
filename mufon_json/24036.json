Approximately 10 a.m. on June 17, 2010. Partly cloudy day. Inside of a cloud mass, a unmoving horizontal approximately 200 foot long ribbon of shimmering gold, silver, purple appeared for 2 seconds then vanished. I noticed it because it was the cloud mass in my line of sight. I immediately thought it was a UFO because nothing shimmers like that then vanishes instantly. I felt calm and delighted that I got to see it, yet disappointed that it vanished so soon. I did laugh because it's as if once I registered it, it vanished."],"Summary":"Horizontal ribbon of shimmering gold, silver, purple.","Log Number":"US-06302010-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.615561,+-73.929673(24036)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24036) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/30/2010 07:52 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/17/2010 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.929673","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Case Number":"24036"}
