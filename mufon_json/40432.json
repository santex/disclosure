i watched it completely disappear in less than a minute, less than fifteen seconds actually. i looked back to the other light and at that moment it too appeared to change direction, from moving south to moving to the west and it began to fade from sight appearing to be going west directly away from me straight ahead of me, as opposed to the first one which had traveled further south and therefore was at an angle to me (west\\southwest) when it disappeared. i was facing due west. i did not take my eyes off of the second one and i watched it as it got progressively smaller until i could see only a tiny white circle such as a star would appear in the distant sky and it seemed to be very far away, but for all i know it had stayed in place and merely faded out. it had also taken less than a minute to disappear, that is, for it to no longer appear to be present in the sky. there was nothing left in the sky along their apparent flight path such as debris etc, smoke, or contrails. i have seen planets in the night sky and they always appear to be sharply round or at least sharp in their outline whereas these objects had irregular outlines and were brilliant in appearance, really beautiful in color although neither gave off a glow nor had a \"halo\" i don't know what happened to either object except they appeared to become progressively smaller until i could no longer see them at all. i scanned the sky for another hour on this clear night (with the full moon behind me) for anything even vaguely resembling what i saw but did not see anything moving in the sky , not even the occasional aircraft i normally see in the evening. i have never seen anything like this before but im eighty percent sure there's an explanation other than an extraterrestrial one."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"44.074246","Log Number":"US-07072012-0007"}
