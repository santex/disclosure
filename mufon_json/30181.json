She called me on the phone and told me that she was on the Kutztown Bypass On June 4, 2010 when she saw red lights which were too low and did not move. She was on her way to her grandsons graduation in Wyomissing at the high school. She said that there was some sort of activity at the local airport involving, I believe she said, aviation history. But she didn't think that the red lights had anything to do with the airport. She left her name but I cannot reveal it because I made a promise to keep her name confidential. She had no further details."],"Log Number":"US-07152011-0006","Longitude":"-75.771978","Latitude":"40.518406","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/04/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30181.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30181.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.518406,+-75.771978(30181)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30181) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
