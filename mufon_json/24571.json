All of a sudden I looked up and saw a HUGE fireball, My first reaction was maybe it was a small comet burning up. My second reaction was we were about to be bombed, then it seperated into three pieces, the middle piece remained larger than the two pieces on either ide. They all maintained equal distance from either as they spread apart. Then they dissapeared and as fast as they went two came back and then two more appeared to form a diamond, then a fifth appeared on the bottom right. the two on the left and right dissapeared and appeared lower, then bottom left light moved diagonolly toward upper right. I tried to get my video camera on my droid to work but it wouldn't penetrate the window. I ran down five flights of stairs out the back door and as I turned the corner two were left litterally zipping back and forth and then they were gone as fast as they appeared. This went on for atleast ten minutes."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.348762","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"One big fire ball.","Sighting Duration":"00:10:24","Log Number":"US-07162010-0023","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24571.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24571.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/16/2010 09:35 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in West Chester","There was one other sighting in West Chester on or around July 16th 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-84.399658","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"West Chester","Region":"Ohio","Case Number":"24571","Date Submitted":"07/16/2010 10:29 UTC"}
