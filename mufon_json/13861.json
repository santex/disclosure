{"Case Number":"13861","divs":["Sighting DetailsI spotted 3 bright lights in the sky after exiting the Christiana Mall near Wilmington. At first I thought they were stars or airline traffic headed toward Philadelphia. I watched the objects for a few minutes. They did not move. They were hovering at different altitudes. The highest object was the farthest south, while the lowest object was farthest north. I left the mall and continued toward Hockessin, DE. While headed north on Rt. 7, I noticed the 3 objects again. This time, the lowest object was moving toward the east, at a lower altitude. It appeared to be completely round (ball-like) but was surrounded by a light which pulsated as it moved. The light was unlike typical plane strobes or flashing lights. The object seemed to glow and pulsate. I lost sight of it as I traveled north on Rt. 7."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Delaware","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Latitude":"39.745833","Date Submitted":"11/18/2008 06:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-11202008-0026","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.745833,+-75.546667(13861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13861) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13861.html"],"City":"Wilmington","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Wilmington","There were no other sightings in Wilmington on or around November 18th 2008"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-75.546667","Date of the Event":"11/18/2008 06:45 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 stationary lights at different altitudes. 1 moved and pulsated with light."}
