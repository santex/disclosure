{"Summary":"Dusk Sighting","divs":["Sighting Details Sitting outside playing with dog. Lookedup and thought I saw a star. Light was very bright, thought at first it wasVenus - but it was moving slowly away from me in a south westerly direction. Then I thought it was a balloon and finally thought it must be an aeroplanebecause the shape changed from a round bright object (I am sure it was a light)and then became diamond shaped. When I saw the diamond shape I thought it wasthe fuselage of a jet with the wings on either side then it went back to be around bright light again. The speed never varied but the light seemed to getbrighter. It never changed speed or direction just kept going in the samedirection. All of sudden if just disappeared. The object was going towards thesunset and that is why it could not have been the sunlight reflecting offsomething - the sun was behind it."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"02/07/2001 07:20 UTC","City":"CURLEWIS","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/07/2001 07:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.253775,+-85.323214(1191)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1191) map </A>","Longitude":"-85.323214","Log Number":"","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"1191","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ontario","Latitude":"51.253775","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1191.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1191.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1191.html"],"Country":"Canada","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been no other sightings in CURLEWIS","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
