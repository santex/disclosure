{"City":"Santa Monica","Longitude":"-118.485881","Summary":"2 lights almost about 75 degrees up, and east of the moon appeared and suddenly disappeared","Date Submitted":"12/05/2008 06:20 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"California","divs":["sighting detailsabout 5:40pm i arrived at santa monica college for a class. upon arrival i had looked to the west to admire jupiter and venus shining brightly in the sky. i'm an astronomy enthusiast and i had heard a couple days ago that the moon and the two planets were close together and i was looking at how far the moon had travled away from the two planets. i was in line waiting to get into a lab class when about 6:20pm i looked at the moon again and two lights caught my eye that i hadn't noticed before. they were lined up vertically to the east of the moon, about 1-1\\2 hand widths or so, directly over a building on the campus called the hss building. at first i thought i was looking at sirius or vega but the two lights (the vertically higher one was slightly brighter) were colored more like incandescent car headlights with a slightly yellow hue to them. if you can imagine a car headlight off in the distance and how you can see the source but not the beam of light, then you know what it looked like. except they were high in the sky, east of the moon and not moving at all. i turned my head for a second to adjust my glasses and looked up again and the lower of hte two lights was gone. the higher one was there for another second then slowly dimmed out of sight. at first i thought i went behind a really dark dense cloud but i couldnt find any clouds. i kept watching the same spot and a few seconds later a high flying airplace (with blinking blue and red lights) passed by the area very close to where i saw the two motionless lights and it never disappeared so i knew a cloud was not what caused the light to dim out of sight. the lights didn't move and were very clear. there was no shape to them. just pin points like stars. living in a large city you dont see very many stars. you see planets from time to time and some of the brightest stars but these two light looked too large and had the wrong color hue. just to be sure when i got home later i checked an astronomy program i have on my computer to see if maybe there was a really bright constellation in the area at that time and there was nothing that bright. they were as bright as venus, made no sound or movement. just on then off. i thought maybe it ould be a helicopter but there was no noise and even helicopters have blinking marker lights. i kept looking in the area to see if they would come back, but after 10 minutes i gave up"],"Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14255.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14255.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.021684,+-118.485881(14255)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14255) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"14255","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Santa Monica","There were no other sightings in Santa Monica on or around December 5th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"12/05/2008 06:20 UTC","Latitude":"34.021684","Log Number":"US-12062008-0005"}
