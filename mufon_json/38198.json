I watched it head in a NW below the treeline. It was far off in the sky and slow moving but faster than star. It significantly larger than any start more than 5 times then size of anything in the sky. All the stars moved in a more regular western heading. This had a different heading. It passed other stars which blocked them out. I checked the space station website to verify that it was not it the flight path. Several airplane went by in other areas but near the bright light. This light dwarfed the planes in comparison. I do have photos since the object was slow moving. The photos were taken on my phone so are of poor quality."],"Date Submitted":"05/17/2012 01:54 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Chehalis","There was one other sighting in Chehalis on or around May 16th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"38198","Country":"United States"}
