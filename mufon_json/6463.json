Then it, without even stopping,changes course to down and back, diagonally, much faster (unlike a chopper.) when It is near the tree line it stopped and hovered, then gradually sank below the trees. Later on my next lift ride I saw It apparently rise up again and fly away."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval","Date of the Event":"02/21/2007 06:30 UTC","Region":"New York","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02262007-0004","Latitude":"40.721893","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.721893,+-73.998313(6463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6463) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around February 21st 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.998313","Disposition":"Unknown"}
