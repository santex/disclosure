{"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on the back deckon august 10th, 2012 (facing north). A large star appeared to the northeast. The object started out small and white, but then the sphere turned golden-orange, and slowly grew to about the size of a dime. After about two minutes another white object appeared about 2 inches away from the stationary orange sphere.. I sat and observed them for another 3 minutes of so, and they slowly went dim. I observed them turning into what looked like regular stars. During the whole observation, about 5 minutes or so, the orange sphere stayed stationary. The small white sphere orbited the other counter clock-wise.. I have no explanation for what I saw, and I ahve other friends that have seen lights with me on other occasions. I believe that White House, Tn is a UFO hotspot area or something. Please write me back I would really appreciate some feedback about what this could be in my town.. Thank you, HBO"],"Case Number":"47205","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"Tennessee","trends":["There have been no other sightings in White House","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"08/10/2012 02:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Latitude":"36.455392","City":"White House","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-86.682168","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47205.html"],"Log Number":"US-05052013-0033","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"05/05/2013 11:56 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.455392,+-86.682168(47205)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47205) map </A>","Summary":"A stationary orange sphere occompanied by a smaller white sphere.","Tags":"City"}
