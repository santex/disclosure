{"Latitude":"29.405779","divs":["Sighting DetailsWalked to the back of my truck in the drive way. It was about 9:30pm on 8-12-12. I was just looking up and I saw a small spec of light moving south. I thought it was a satellite and thought how will I know it's you and not a satellite? Just then it shot down so fast I was going to run then I was going to fall to the ground. Then it stopped, moved in circles then shot back up and vanished into the darkness. So, I feel like they were letting me see that, they saw me."],"Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.405779,+-98.539133(41724)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41724) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"Small dot, stayed small as it decended at me.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"San Antonio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41724.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41724.html"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"08/12/2012 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 08:25 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Case Number":"41724","Log Number":"US-08132012-0031","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around August 12th 2012"],"Longitude":"-98.539133"}
