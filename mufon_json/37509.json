I was running towards the back door when I noticed something in the sky on the left above (at very low cloud level) my neighbours house. I stopped and looked at the object for a good 15 seconds before I got scared and ran inside. The object was spherical, with pincer-like arms coming out of either side. There was a large black window and the rest was white with some black on the pincers.It wasn't making a sound but the pincers were moving slowly pulling at or separating a cloud. Whilst watching the object I felt really scared so I ran inside and didn't tell anyone until I saw more UFOs as an adult and understood what they were."],"Date Submitted":"04/16/2012 08:08 UTC","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Adelaide","There were no other sightings in Adelaide on or around November 1st 1991"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"37509","Object Features":"Window(s), Appendage(s)","City":"Adelaide","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37509.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37509.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"138.602045","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Spherical UFO with pincers was stationary above my neighbours house.","Log Number":"AU-04162012-0009","Country":"Australia","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Tags":"City","Region":"South Australia","Date of the Event":"11/01/1991 12:00 UTC"}
