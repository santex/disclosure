I told him it was a street lamp or an airplane, since there's always a lot of airplane activity. We took of driving east and the object seemed to have disappeared. Driving down a main street I looked up and the UFO appeared because it lit up again then dimmed out. 10 seconds later it appeared again in a different area, moved much to fast to be a man made object. I was terrified and wanted to cry. We lost track after we starting heading north again."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48515.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"29.932377","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-95.453835","City":"Houston","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around June 29th 2013"]}
