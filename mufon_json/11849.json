Then it just stopped under a cloud and we could see a airplane fly 1000 feet right over it. It stayed in one spot for about five minutes pulsating, then it traveled slowly NW over Allentown out of sight range."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.61688,+-75.487253(11849)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11849) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/31/2008 09:15 UTC","Summary":"Pulsating Bright Light over Allentown as wide as jet liner","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"07/31/2008 09:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11849.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11849.html"],"trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Allentown","There were no other sightings in Allentown on or around July 31st 2008"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07312008-0016","Object Shape":"Disc","Latitude":"40.61688","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.487253"}
