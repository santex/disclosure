Weather was quite abnormalfor this time of year usually cloudy, overcast and full of rain, but therewasnt a cloud in the sky. Two business associates of mine and I were lying onthe 35 degree slope of an isoceles triangle covered with grass overlooking thelarge park that borders the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh and Stedelijk Museums. We werewatching children play football (soccer), dogs chase frisbees, school girlslaugh and play - and up in the sky commercial airliners fly left and right. Theywere at cruising altitude and I was watching a 747 with four very distinct vaportrails, two behind either wing, flying south when my associate Scott yelled HeyDaniels, Whats That?! and he pointed to what was without doubt a flying saucer.Flying twice as fast as the 747 at a lower altitude (perhaps 20000 feet) with arelative diameter"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Amsterdam","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
