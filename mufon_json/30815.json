{"Summary":"saw three bright lights appears, move around then vanish. then started seeing red lights moving in odd patterns.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting Detailsit started on thursday night, the 4th. there were thrre of us sitting around talking outside when my dad pointed out the three bright lights, they looked liked street lights. one light vanished within 5 seconds, the other two dropped straight down about two inches in the sky, then also vanished. amazed we werent able to peel our eyes from the sky. we then noticed 2 flashing red lights travleing away from eachother, one to the north and other to the south. the light travleing to the north was keeping a steady pace when without any manuvering it did a 180 degree direction change in the blink of an eye and was now travleing south. as we kept watching it came to a complete stop in the sky then dropped maybe 3 or 4 inches in the sky to come to another complete stop. at this stime we noticed the other red light doing circles, 90 degree turns, up, down, left, right. they both lloked like a fly buzzing around in the sky. these two red lights never vanished, but kept flying around. a little while later we saw what we thought was two fighter jets head southwest, we watched them fly out of sight and display no odd flight patterns. within a couple minutes we saw what we thought again was 2 fighter jets headed due south now, as i kept watching one drifted off from the other now headed west, as i kept watching the othere headed due south i witnessed the same odd flight patterns as earlier, a fly in the sky. after that we all went to bed. I get home real early in the morning on monday the 8th to find another real bright light in the sky just like the first ones we saw on thursday the 4th. as soon as i saw it displaying the odd flight patterns from the other night, i ran and got our telescope. throught the scope i was able to clearly make out a perfectly cicrcular object. the surface looked like that of a basketball at first, kinda rough with dark lines and black spots on it. i could look away long enough to blink a couple times and the surface would appear completely different then before. while i was watching it all of a sudden it went all dark, invisible to the human eye, but was still able to make out its perimeter through the scope. not even a minute goes by and the object lights back up. i was able to see that same one until sun up that morning, even after the sun was up a little bit i could still see the reflection off of the object. that same night i witnessed over 30 of those red blinking lights from thursday the 4th. looking through the scope i could identify them as all looking the exact same, all of them were circular or sphere shape, all of them had the same changing surface, and all of them had some internal light source, their surface looked transparent. i could see a rainbow of colors insdide each one. this is now thursday the 11th and i have sat out the last three nights and observed the same objects with the same flight patterns. one night there was one bright enough that i could see it through my little digital camera, i have over a minute of video displaying the odd flight patterns, buzzing around like a fly in the sky. after i took the video i counted the individual red flashing lights that i dentified to be all the same, i counted 57 of them. i dont want to look up anymore"],"Date Submitted":"08/11/2011 05:52 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-121.371097","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08112011-0013","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.224583,+-121.371097(30815)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30815) map </A>","Case Number":"30815","Latitude":"42.224583","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30815.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Bonanza","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bonanza","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Oregon","Date of the Event":"08/04/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
