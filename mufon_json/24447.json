My husband was recovering from knee replacement surgery and was sleeping in another bedroom across from mine. His bedroom window was facing north. When I went into the room to check on him I could see through the window a very bright white light moving in the sky towards the house. I could not hear any noise. As the object approched and was about to go over the house I went back to my own bedroom window (faces south) to see what this thing was. It went almost directly over the house. I opened my bedroom window to listen, it was completely silent as it passed. The object was large and low and seem to slowly float over . The back of the craft appeared rounded with multi- colored non-blinking lights. It was very large; as large as a football field. My immediate thoughts was that this must be a U.F.O. The object just slowly floated away over the tree line of the neighboring park."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24447.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24447.html"],"Latitude":"36.750737","Date of the Event":"04/24/2010 02:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"24447","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
