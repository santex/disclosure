Shes on the computer playing a game..im in my bed watching her, my dog starts trying to get my attention. He wants to go outside so i let him out, but as i do so i realize the moon is shinning very brightly and recall hearing something about a fullest moon of the year or something a day or two before hand. so anyway i walk outside with my dog and check out the moon. I stand next to my pool and look up directly at the moon and as im doing this i catch something moving in the corner of my eye. i look closer and i see this boomerrang shaped object flying in a straight line across the sky..no lights..no sound..nothing. i had a number of emotions like surge through me at that point an time, mostly i felt somewhat scared or frightened. the craft passed over my house and as this time i go back inside to get my girlfriend so she can see this craft. but by the time we got back outside it was gone=(. She says she believes me lol i've told my mother of course she doesnt nor does anyone else=("],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Case Number":"37982","Log Number":"US-05072012-0009","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around May 6th 2012"],"City":"Mesa"}
