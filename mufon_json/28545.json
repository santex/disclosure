I was looking at mostly the underside of it and there were 3 white lights and 1 red light on the underside. The lights were what drew my attention to it. It was moving too slowly to be a plane, was only about 25 feet above the ground and I did not notice any noise. It was not particularly large, but I can't estimate the size. I thought of the stealth bomber, since it was triangular, but it wasn't big enough and was so close to the ground that I couldn't believe that was what it was. I was quite frightened by it and made my dog come back in the house, closed the door and walked away from the door."],"Log Number":"US-04052011-0006","Case Number":"28545","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"04/05/2011 09:06 UTC","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around April 4th 2011"]}
