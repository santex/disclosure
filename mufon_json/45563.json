(please note, the backyard here butts up to the entry way into the complex so the distant house is around 100ft away.) tonight was the same this, except it was over the house to the left of the first house. i tried to get a picture but sd card wasn't working. this time it was the same thing. it lasted about 5 min before disappearing. the object appears to be way off in the distance, probably more than 10 miles or so. my feelings were that of curiosity. i lost sight of object both times when it dipped behind roofs of distant houses."],"Latitude":"36.297292","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45563.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45563.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.297292,+-115.307227(45563)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45563) map </A>","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around February 4th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City"}
