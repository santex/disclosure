On Halloween night right before 7:30 p.m. I went out on my second floor porch to breathe in some cool autumn air. The sky was clear and I could see most of the stars although there is some light pollution here. Suddenly, traveling from from the northeast to the southwest were three lights in a boomerang shape- one light on each end and one in the middle of the craft. I would estimate that the object was only a couple of thousand feet in the air (relatively low) but was moving several hundred miles per hour and was completely silent. Also the craft seemed to rotate slightly back and forth as it sped forward and then almost 90 degrees before it faded away."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26258.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26258.html"],"Log Number":"US-10312010-0024","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Boomerang","City":"Attleboro","Longitude":"-71.275688","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/31/2010 07:41 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05"}
