The land sold so I had to move. I found a lovely space south west of the property near to a phenomena-haunted lake, Rainbow Lake. On Monday morning, I followed my pattern of taking Tiffany on a walk. It was 6 0 6 a.m. As I stepp'd out of my fenced yard, I look'd up at the sky and recognized Saturn, Venus and the Crescent Moon sitting between the two. As my eyes rested on the sliver of the moon, I saw a third orb appear right above the moon and drop straight down and then begin to wander off to the south east. The appearance was quick and didn't last long."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17031.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17031.html"],"Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Hoax","Date Submitted":"05/18/2009 06:06 UTC","Log Number":"US-05202009-0016","Object Flight Path":"Other","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Waco","There were no other sightings in Waco on or around May 18th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.556633,+-97.14005(17031)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17031) map </A>","Summary":"Saturn drop in front of the crescent Moon.","Date of the Event":"05/18/2009 06:06 UTC"}
