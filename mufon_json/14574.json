My granfather , my brother Bob and his friend Steve.Not much to do in a small minning town (Chuquicamata) in the northern part of the Andes in Chile. My grandfather saw it first as he pulled the car to the side of the road. This object was massive as it silently hoovered over the main hospital of the town, which sits on a hilltop. It was a huge series of lights in a circular pattern , slowly rotating in one direction then to the next. What caught my eye is the streetlights leading up the hill and the hospital lights were all out. This object was totally silent. Then it Rolled on its side to where the circle was now verticle. At this point I could make out a distinct rumble. At that point the object shot over the horizon at an incredible rate of speed , Leaving A gold like trail which lingered in the air before disapating. I do remember that none of us were afraid but rather excited . Since , I have studied UFOs my whole life. ( Sorry for spelling errors, ect )."],"Object Features":"Window(s)","Longitude":"-68.925307"}
