I was driving on the highway and started looking up at the sky and all of a sudden I noticed a red ball of light. I wasnt sure what it was, I thought I was crazy, then out of the corner of my eye about 50 feet away from it was a circle, saucer like object with four different colored lights underneath. One yellow, one green, one blue, one red. I knew it couldnt be life flight, they only have two lights close together and are not shaped like circles. Neither are regular planes. As soon as I had seen it I just watched in amazement, not to mention I was driving and almost went off the road from gazeing on this flying thing in the sky. I had never felt so excited and so Frightened in all my life. I couldn't believe what i was seeing! I kept driving and looking at it as much as I could but lost sight of it over the moutains."],"Log Number":"US-08052011-0028","Longitude":"-76.994149","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Williamsport","There were no other sightings in Williamsport on or around May 1st 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:02:36","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc"}
