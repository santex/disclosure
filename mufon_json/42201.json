The lights did not blink but glowed the whole time. I found it weird that they were in a perfect triangle. They didn't look to be moving. I called my husband and we ran outside but by then there was only 1 light left. It just hovered and then it just disappeared. I have never seen anything like it before and made me feel very uneasy."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42201.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Summary":"3 bright orange orb shaped in triangular formation","Longitude":"-81.785314","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"42201","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.311884"}
