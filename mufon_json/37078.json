It was early in the morning when I saw what at first I assumed were a flock of birds but there was something that impressed me as possibly not being right so I took a photo and quit frankly forgot about it until sometime later when I was reviewing my digital photos and came upon the photo attached (the second photo attached is an enlargement of the first). What became immediately apparent about these objects is that they do not appear to have heads, tails, or for that matter, wings and look to be solid retangular objects although the corners may be rounded. The were flying in a V formation from right to left. Please feel free to contact me at my email address if you would like. Tim"],"Longitude":"10.902764","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"37078"}
