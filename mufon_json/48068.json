Looked similar to the object on the \"Fayatteville\" show on TV but the central shape was more like a football than an egg, however the protruding \"spoke\" shaped light beams look much like the one in Fayetteville, North Carolina on January 8, 2007 incident. The arced beams in the central portion, the ones that were shaped like seams on a football also seemed to rotate around its football shape and then seemed to cut through the middle like tines on an egg beater. Could not see any craft against the dark sky. Only saw the intensely bright beams. Depth perception and possibly size were skewed because of the dark. Object seemed enormous but perspective may be off due to the solid darkness and nothing to reference it to."],"Summary":"light beams shaped like seams on a football with beams at both ends like spokes of a bike rotating in opposite directions","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48068.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48068.html"],"Longitude":"-116.94784","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"48068","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.204257,+-116.94784(48068)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48068) map </A>","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.204257","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","Date Submitted":"06/11/2013 08:30 UTC"}
