{"Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"16576","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy brother called and invited me and my son to go to the lake (South Holston)that afternoon. It was a gorgeous day. I was trying to mow the yard and had given up cause my mower was not pulling. Anyway we went to the lake. I usually take my camera. I don't know anything about photography. My camera is a kodak easy share point and shoot. 5 megapixels. I didn't even realize that this might be a ufo until I got home and downloaded the photos to the computer. My wife said it is a cloud, but the sky was a beautiful blue with no clouds. And it is probably some sort of light reflection or something. But I have taken about a 1000 pictures up on the lake over the last several years and have never had anything ever show up on it. Anyway make of it what you will. It very will may be some photgraphic boo boo. We didn't hear any sounds or anything."],"Log Number":"US-04192009-0009","Longitude":"-82.180414","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/17/2009 03:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Bristol","There were no other sightings in Bristol on or around April 17th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Tennessee","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"04/17/2009 03:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"36.599956","Summary":"Me, my brother and my son were enjoying the day on the lake.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16576.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16576_submitter_file1__100_1495.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16576.html"],"City":"Bristol","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.599956,+-82.180414(16576)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16576) map </A>"}
