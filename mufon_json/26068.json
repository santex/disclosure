I noticed an object moving across the torso towards the moon (located south east of me and was a almost full). The object appeared as a star in brightness and shape. As it proceeded towards the moon, it stopped abruptly about half way. Then just as quickly as it stopped it faded away from sight. I did observe three aircraft flying north-northeast of me at the time of the sighting. One aircraft was heading due north, the second due west, and the third south-southeast. The third aircraft did fly near the spot where I saw the object disappear, however it was approx 1-2 minutes after the object disappeared. It did also appear to be a significantly lower altitude then the object had been at."],"Case Number":"26068","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Star like object over Washington, IA","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
