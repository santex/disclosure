I entered my north facing patio, I saw the object toward the west, slowly traveling east, pulsing in various orange-red lights about once a second. The object from my perspective (and seen by my mother) was about the size of a small pea. All that we could see was the lights..in a ring shape pattern, like the edges of a saucer shape were outlined by lights. It traveled slowly, for approx. 20 seconds, in a straight line from west to east. It then began to fade, like turning down a dimmer switch, where I lost sight of it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"43220","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Rockwood","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.131242"}
