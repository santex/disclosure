I stood at the edge of the lawn looking at the local park and saw these bright lights. I thought maybe \"huh, military?\" and then when I saw more we ran across the street to the open lawn to watch them across the sky. There were about 10 and they just barely cleared the treeline. 'W' formation until they just flickered and went out. We're unsure if someone set off paper lamps after the fireworks display--merely 20-30 minutes before--or if it was something unexplained. We drove out in the direction of it and kept track of our times in case we had an encounter but we didn't see anything. It was a bit unnerving but being an enthusiast I'd like some answers. Unfortunately, our camera and phones couldn't capture the objects--we just about lost our heads because of it."],"Case Number":"49055","Date Submitted":"07/20/2013 12:26 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07202013-0001","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49055.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49055.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
