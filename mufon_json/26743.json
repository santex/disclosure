yes. though, i looked at nasa's human space flight sky log database\\site, right after my sighting, and searched for my location and the appropriate time, but did not see any two satellites that moved in the same direction at exactly the same time listed there (for my location and that time). so, i have not proven that they were satellites. i've never seen satellites move in tandem or appear to move away from the planet, so i thought i'd report these."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11262010-0003","Case Number":"26743","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","Date Submitted":"11/26/2010 11:09 UTC","Longitude":"-121.3063","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/26/2010 06:22 UTC","Latitude":"44.067763","Summary":"112610, Oregon, Two Lights Moving in Tandem in Early Dark","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"00:08:00","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Bend"}
