While walking south from Albany avenue in between Ashley street and Collins street I looked up into the night sky. I noticed a solid light from a close distance I immediately thought it was a helicopter. So I listen for the noise of the motor but the object made no noise. I tried to alert my friends of this strange object with no sound but I could not because i felt in a trance or mesmerized by the sight. So i thought to myself it was heading in the south direction so it should pass over the Collin-Bennet building and the reflection of the light should illuminate the building and the object because it was passing at a low altitude so i stared. Continuing to walk down the sidewalk my friends was talking. I was so amazed with what i was seeing i did not hear a word they were saying. With anticipation the object finally proceeded to pass over the building and truthfully what i saw next is indescribable but i will try my best. The light hit the building at a very close proximity and it looked very dim and controlled. The light illuminated a very small portion of the building unlike nothing i have ever seen before. I believed the object was no more than 10 feet from the top of the building. So the light should have been more visible. The light from the object was only visible within a diameter of no more than 5-10 feet. I never seen that in a beam of light. After the object passed out of sight range i immediately turned to my friends and said\" DID YOU SEE THAT \"?. They looked at me with such confusion it still effects me to this day. Its been seventeen years and i still think about that day. I cant get it out of my head so i decided to write you. This date has an emotional connection because a week later my uncle Eric Anderson died of cancer so that���s why i am sure that it was in April of 1992. No later than the last week of March 1992 for any skeptics. The object moved slow, steady, and balanced about 5 mph when it passed over the building there was no type of vibration or movement. I also remember that night the news had reported a strange light over downtown Hartford Connecticut."],"Log Number":"US-05292009-0013","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"04/15/1992 09:00 UTC","trends":[],"Summary":"I saw something strange in the night sky 17 years ago and I can't forget it.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
