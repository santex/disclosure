I'm not sure why I even noticed their presence honestly. A moment later the two lights began to move south to north at what appeared to be a very high altitude, judging from the nearby aircraft visible at the time. One of the lights turned red while the other became noticeably brighter. Both objects seem to slow for a moment, but at that moment I ran for the house to try to get a second witness. Unfortunately I wasn't able to locate the objects when I returned with a second person and had to play the whole thing off as shooting stars to avoid ridicule."],"Region":"South Carolina","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-07292012-0003","City":"Travelers Rest","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/29/2012 12:59 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41238.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41238.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
