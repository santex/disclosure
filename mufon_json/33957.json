I always look to the north west of where i live because i always see the lights in the sky there. There were 3 light up in the sky when i looked. I looked back at the road then back up to the lights and they were gone. When i made it home i went and got my camera. I decide to try to take a photo or video of them. The lights go on, then they went out. then they would come on in another area of the same north west sky. they always do. I took some video of them for about 3 hours off and on. I knew what the lights were. The lights was not airplanes, i could see the airplanes fly by where the lights where, because when the plans came by the lights would go out. Then come back on when the plane passed. I was excited to see the lights in the sky. Like I said before I always watch for them. I finally gave up watching and went to bed about 10 p.m."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Tonopah","There were no other sightings in Tonopah on or around November 16th 2011"],"Longitude":"-112.881183","Log Number":"US-12112011-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.51575,+-112.881183(33957)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33957) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33957.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33957.html"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering","Case Number":"33957","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"i watched the lights for about 3 hours and video tape it too. i see the lights all the time during the fall, winter and spring months the","Date of the Event":"11/16/2011 06:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"33.51575"}
