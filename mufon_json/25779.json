{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were at the intersection of Peck Rd. and Heritage Rd. on the western edge of Saint Charles, IL. We were at a stop sign facing west. Ahead of us in the Western sky we could distinctly see 12-15 reddish lights (looked like stars) that were obviously moving (heading) towards us (not across the sky). We watched the lights for several minutes before driving away. We noticed that other people had pulled over to observe this occurrence. There were several cars pulled over in the parking lot of the Kane County Courthouse (Rt. 38 & Peck Rd) that were angled to observe this. My wife asked me what it was and I told her I had no idea and that I have never seen anything like it before and that I have seen the aurora borealis, comets, meteor showers and shooting stars. The objects were vertically oriented in the sky rather than horizontally across the sky. They were not in a straight line but were more random in formation. They were very separate from one another not closely formed but definitely in a cluster."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in St Charles","There were no other sightings in St Charles on or around October 9th 2010"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.919194","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"St Charles","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25779.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25779.html"],"Longitude":"-88.306077","Case Number":"25779","Log Number":"US-10102010-0010","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.919194,+-88.306077(25779)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25779) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/10/2010 11:08 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois","Date of the Event":"10/09/2010 07:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"12-15 Red / orange lights heading towards earth","Disposition":"IFO"}
