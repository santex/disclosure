I will go into more detail later on. Everything that I am going to write actually happened. It changed my life forever. It was one of those events such as the Kennedy assassination and the World Trade Center bombing that is etched in most brains. This event happened in 1964 on a late July weekday evening. I was fourteen years old and Dan Lake was 13 years old. The sun was just beginning to set in the western sky. With all the air pollution of those days the sunset was usually a bright reddish color. It was still bright enough to easily see. The sky was perfectly clear on this beautiful day. The temperature was about 75 degrees. For the last couple of weeks Dan and I would walk about a mile from our house to the A and W root beer stand. We called it The Barrel because the roof was composed of a huge wooden, orange barrel After a day of playing baseball we would buy a root beer and the best hotdogs I have ever had. We would walk through the residential area and over the railroad tracks. On North Main Street and adjacent to the root beer stand to the north was a nursery. It is still there today. We were about 30 yards behind the nursery in an open area heading east. I looked behind me while we were walking to check out the gorgeous sunset. It was at this time that I noticed to the west, but not directly toward the sunset a light blink. The object was about 40 yards away. It was about 25 degrees above the flat ground. It was heading right for us at a very slow rate of speed. The best way I could describe the speed of the object would be to straighten your arm out and spin in a circle, taking about ten to thirteen seconds to go one revolution. So as you can see it was moving very slowly. It was also still way too early in the evening for any lightning bugs to be out. They are usually lighting up much closer to dark. The light was a strange color. I would describe the color as kind of a creamy green. It wasn���t a bright green. This attracted my attention because I had not seen this color in nature before this time. I will describe more about the color and where it came from later. I should mention now that I was an eagle boy scout at that time. We went camping in Illinois almost every month. The boy scouts went camping almost every month for many years. We went camping for a week in Upper Michigan and Canada every summer. I went fishing approximately 20 times every summer at my grandparents place in southern Illinois. What I am trying to say is that I have been outdoors and in the woods all of my life. This was definitely not a lightening bug or the synonym, a firefly. I do wear glasses, but I have perfect vision with the glasses. Dan Lake has always had perfect vision. After I saw this UFO I did extensive research for many years in the library. There are very few bugs that are luminescent on land. In the oceans there are more luminescent creatures deep under the sea. I talked to a couple of professors at Northern Illinois University about things that give off their own light. They had never heard of such a thing that I described to them. I also was feeling that they thought I was out of my mind. So because of the blinking and the color of the light this object drew our undivided attention. The UFO continued to head right for us. My feeling at the time was not of fear, but curiosity. I remember my saying to Dan, ���What the hell is that?��� The UFO was heading in a perfectly straight line towards us, again at about twenty-five degrees from the ground. The blinking light was also very strange in an additional way. This is one thing I have been a little bit unsure of over the years. That was how often the UFO blinked. It seems to me it was about every three seconds. I am 100% positive that the blinking cream green colored light blinked at the exact interval with every blink. The duration of the blink was very short. The light did not stay on very long. I would estimate about one fourth of one second. So it went on, then immediately off completely. This is absolutely nothing like a lightening bug. Dan Lake and I stood facing the approaching object with Dan at my immediate left. We were now able to get a very close look at the very strange object. The UFO came down to our immediate left. It was still blinking at the same interval. It leveled off at chest high level. I am six feet tall and Dan was about a foot shorter at that age. It remained at this height the entire time it circled us. There was no change in its height whatsoever. The object was only three and a half feet from us. It began to circle us in an absolute perfect circle. The speed remained the same. The height remained the same. I am six feet tall and Dan was about a foot shorter at that age. The UFO continued to circle us over and over and over. I can���t remember how many times it went around us. The number of revolutions was quite high. If I had to guess I would say 15 times. I don���t remember us saying much, but my heart was really beating fast. When Dan gets excited his eyes open really wide. They were really wide when I glanced at him. More about the UFO now. I would estimate that it was about seven millimeters in diameter. It was definitely not a centimeter in diameter. I remember that is seemed to be perfectly round. If it wasn���t perfectly round, it was very close to it. The object was not spinning at all. I am also positive about this. When you are this close to an object you can see details like this. When not blinking I could not tell the any difference between the front part and the rear. The body of the object was a black in color. The color did not change at all. I also seem to remember the body being kind of segmented into four quarters. The segmented part was very faint. There were no distinct lines where the segmented part was visible. Where was the strange light coming from? It was coming out of the back, bottom quarter of the object. When the light was not blinking, that segment looked just like the other three segments in color and shape. No light at all was visible when it wasn���t blinking. There were definitely no visible characteristics of life on the object. There were no eyes, nose, ears, hair and legs. There were definitely no wings of any kind. There was no sign of any kind of propulsion coming from the UFO. There was no air disturbance of any kind. The object was completely silent. There was no buzzing or humming."],"Longitude":"-89.087795"}
