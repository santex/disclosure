I had not been laying there for too long when I felt what I can best describe as a wave of paralysis starting with my feet and moving to my head quickly. I could not move nor open my eyes. I heard a low humming sound. I quickly became frightened. My 7 year old Boxer sleeps on the bed next to me and did not make a move or sound so I am not sure if she noticed anything herself. I felt like I was becoming weightless. I woke up at 5:15 AM on the 24th feeling as if I had just laid down and remember fleeting images of a dream I had just had involving me several human like entities. This is not the first time this has happened to me and I felt like it is time to tell someone. I have actually had many encounters with the unknown but have never come forward."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.080493","City":"Fayetteville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35107.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35107.html"],"Log Number":"US-01242012-0022","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Region":"North Carolina","Summary":"Laying in bed, paralysis, feeling of weightlessness, humming, broken mental images of human like entities","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.080493,+-78.727119(35107)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35107) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/24/2012 03:21 UTC","Case Number":"35107","Longitude":"-78.727119"}
