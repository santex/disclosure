I have noticed these lights for quite a few months. I looked through my binoculars and noticed different colors flashing on and off. They move from side to side and back and forth and then go back to the same area that i first noticed.They seem to be very high up in the atmosphere. I also observe lower objects that flash and move all over the sky. I have also seen these objects during the day. When it's clear weather they seem to have a cloud or mist like shroud around them. Inside these shrouds i sometimes see a round circle of light with a cross shape in the circle. They move all over the sky doing sumersalt like moves and also they move in different patterns such as octagon or zig zag or square. I sometimes think they are trying to communicate some mathematical signal. I also observe during the day that they sometimes eject many little light, circle shaped objects with dark circles in their centers. . They are dark and shiny objects that move very eradic around each other. On cloudy days you can see them better moving through the clouds. I have had several witnesses seeing the same objects as i do. I would like to note that i did see an orange orb that was around a foot or two above the ground moving very fast go by my feet and around a telephone pole in a 45 degree turn and then disappear."],"Case Number":"51805","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Chico","There were no other sightings in Chico on or around June 10th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"39.764491","Date of the Event":"06/10/2013 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Chico"}
