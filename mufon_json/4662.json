At first i thought it was a meteor but it was moving across the sky intead of at a downward angle. it seemed to be just above the treeline. i saw it driving south on Brandt island road in fairhaven. Another odd note-- intersections on route six had a light-flashing cop. just waiting. seemed strange, and they were there for roughly 30 minutes (10 minutes after i saw the ufo) this is a totaly unique event in fairhaven, its a very quiet town. delivering pizza for about 2 years and i have never seen this happen. they disbanded about 30 minutes out of town cops returned to their towns and such. area of washington street was blocked from traffic after they disbanded as well."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"41.637604","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4662.html"],"Log Number":"US-04092006-0001","Summary":"Quick flash of bright red ufo","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/08/2006 07:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Fairhaven","Region":"Massachusetts","Date Submitted":"04/08/2006 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"4662","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-70.903649"}
