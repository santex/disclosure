The orb hovered in one place for about an hour while it changed many different colors and appeared to change shape. After hovering for an hour the UFO took off behind a tree line a lot faster than a plane could go. We took 3 pretty cool videos and I have almost twenty pictures. All of my pictures and videos are time stamped because they were taken with my cell phone"],"Latitude":"35.578221","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.578221,+-78.720665(51870)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51870) map </A>","Region":"North Carolina","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Fuquay-Varina","There was one other sighting in Fuquay-Varina on or around October 26th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-78.720665","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"51870","City":"Fuquay-Varina","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/27/2013 03:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Summary":"with boyfriend on back porch and spotyed a glowing ord it changed color and hovered for about an hour before taking off","Date of the Event":"10/26/2013 07:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51870.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51870.html"]}
