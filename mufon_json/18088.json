Remained stationary, then blinked and disappeared.","divs":["sighting detailsi got up to go to the bathroom while it was still very dark outside which is unusual for me. upon stepping back into the hallway to return to bed, i immediately noticed bright orange light spilling out of my bedroom door into the hall. i remember saying, ���what the hell?��� out loud. as i stepped into my bedroom i noticed bright orange light coming through the window so intensely that it was making shadows in the folds of the curtains. i went to the window, looked out, and saw a very large round orange light at the top of the neighboring hill above the trees and houses, almost solid full-moon size, very sun-like. i turned to go get my glasses and it blinked out a couple of times and then went out completely. i returned to the window with my glasses on anyway but saw nothing. the orange light was gone. nothing can really be concluded since i didn���t have my glasses on for near-sightedness and the ���object��� was half of a block away . . . but there is no such light on any home or building where it was. a couple of days later my sister, who lives 1-1\\2 blocks away, immediately spoke of seeing an orange light on 3\\17 upon entrance into my home for a visit. her exact first words to us were, ���what was up with that orange light monday?��� oddly, the location where i believed the light to be when i saw it would be over a field immediately in front of my sister���s house."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"03/17/2008 04:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07152009-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18088.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18088.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"18088","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.447695,+-79.986476(18088)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18088) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/17/2008 04:00 UTC"}
