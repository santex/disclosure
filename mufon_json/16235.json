I believe I have witnessed what you have. Once in Minnesota in 2001 with approximately 20 of the objects and once in Missouri in 2005 with 2 objects. Both days where bright sunny days. The objects where white and seemed to be gliding, very fast and in formation. I too did not see wings flapping but was expecting too which is what made it so peculiar. It was very strange and as hard as I tried to convince myself that they were birds, Pelicans possibly, there was just no way. They were far to high, the formation was spread too far and the objects were moving in perfect unison. It is difficult to explain."],"Disposition":"Hoax"}
