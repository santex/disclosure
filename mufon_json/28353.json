We seen an obeject in the sky with blue lights. It was making radical movements that were unlike any airplane or helicoper I have ever seen (reversed directions very quickly), it was moving much faster also. The lights on it starting changing from blue to red. It was getting farther and farther away from us, then we seen it shoot streight down. It went behind the trees and we could no longer see it. If we see it again, we will let you know."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Louisville","There were no other sightings in Louisville on or around March 21st 2011"],"Date Submitted":"03/22/2011 02:47 UTC","Latitude":"38.260315","Summary":"Lighted object, too far to tell what shape, lights on it were too bright","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03222011-0005","Date of the Event":"03/21/2011 07:30 UTC","City":"Louisville","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
