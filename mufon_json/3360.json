It just happened I could see what looked like a chrome sphere reflecting light at a very high (I m guessing over 10,000 ft)altitude in the northern sky. I told my two co-workers to check it out. When one of them suggested it was a weather balloon another similar sphere appeared from no where and approached the first sphere they appeared to be somewhat stationary but were kind of bobbing ever so slightly. They were so far up it was hard for me to keep focus on them. We finished smoking (about three minutes)and when we looked back up in the sky we saw one streaking at a high rate of speed heading northwest toward Nevada. As a side note: The object was very similar to the silver spheres that have been recently shown on various UFO documentaries."],"City":"Goodyear","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3360.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3360.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-112.358214","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Goodyear","There were no other sightings in Goodyear on or around June 12th 2005"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
