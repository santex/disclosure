Then it flashed 3 times and started moving rapidly at about mach 45.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in Clinton Co. PA. It was in the summer of 2010 I was star gazing on a clear night with no clouds and no moon. AS I scanned the skies an unusual starlike object caught my eye. As I watched it for 5 to 10 minutes it remained stationary. I remember asking myself what star or planet this was. I am a frequent star gazer and attended Ga Tech where I studied Aerospace Engineering. Then, before I could identify it the object flashed 3 times and then instantaniously went from stationary to about mach 45 to 47 and within 2 or 3 seconds was completely out of site. This was the only UFO I have seen in my lifetime (over 50 years). I was completely sober and had no medical problems at the time."],"Log Number":"US-08282012-0007","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.186395","Date Submitted":"08/28/2012 04:50 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"42095","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.204622","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Date of the Event":"07/11/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None"}
