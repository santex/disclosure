I experienced a type of awake-paralysis--teeth were clamped shut and I could not move. My daughter has had numerous accounts of this happening to her. She claims she also saw small white creatures surrounding her bed when that happened. That was in Nashua, NH here where we live now. One of the strange events happened with my parents and my motner-in-law as witness. A huge monster flash of light came in a side window near our house in the woods and streaked through the house-also in the 1980 s. I will write all of these cases down for proper documentation.
