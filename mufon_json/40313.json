A total of 4 objects took the same single file flight path, hovering for moments until they shiftily ascended and eventually disappeared one by one."],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"4 bright red-orange lights taking same flight path one after the other.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Case Number":"40313","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.441103,+-78.647314(40313)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40313) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.647314","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Virginia","Log Number":"US-07062012-0028","Latitude":"37.441103","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40313.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40313.html"]}
