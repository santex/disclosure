Please email me . please. I need to know if anything like this thing has ever been seen before. It appeared what I estimate to either be the higher reaches of our troposphere or lower stratosphere. It seemed to be one large blur of whiteish blue light chasing its tail in a circular path moving in a straight line at same time as spinning and then it just blinked out of sight after a second or two of spinning. I am extremely confused right now. Help. :( I have made a sketch of the object but this site is not allowing me to upload it.
