{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/12/2007 03:05 UTC","Case Number":"8124","Region":"Virginia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw a pinpoint flash in the distance over these trees in an area where I have taken numerous photo's of ufo's before, so I took a picture and then another , and caught ufo's in both. I have posted it at fdinwidy7.tripod.com along with others from the same area. It seems that activity has increased in all areas where I film over the past week. I then went over across the parking lot to a Sheriff sitting in his car to ask him about things flying over without really divulging anything and only after he elaborated on his own experiences did I show him the pictures on my camera. He went on to tell me that he has seen many things unexplained over this area of Pearisburg."],"Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8124.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8124_submitter_file1__oct12afternoon002.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8124_submitter_file2__oct12afternoon003.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8124.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Latitude":"37.330871","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/12/2007 03:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-10122007-0006","City":"Pearisburg","Longitude":"-80.731651","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.330871,+-80.731651(8124)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8124) map </A>","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Pearisburg","There were no other sightings in Pearisburg on or around October 12th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Summary":"Saw a Bright flash like a small reflection then took picture of the area.","Tags":"City"}
