If you look at it with binoculars you can see different lights going clockwise around the UFO. The UFO sometimes stays stationary when I look at it, and I come back 40 minutes later and it is gone. The other night I watched it for quite some time, and it moves around. It will then, disappear. This occurs at least 3-4 times out of the week. I'd really appreciate if you could bring a camcorder or some kind of recording device when you come to talk to me, it would be best if you came at night. I have a a video on my surveillance camera that I have recorded of a UFO in the sky. You would have to come to my house to see the video, I have no other means to shows this video because it's on a VHS."],"Summary":"UFO flies up and down, maneuvers around and just disappears sometimes.","Log Number":"US-03242011-0015","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"03/10/2011 10:06 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28388.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28388.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.898404","Latitude":"38.866144","City":"Georgetown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"03/24/2011 08:32 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
