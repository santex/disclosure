{"divs":["sighting detailsmarlton \\medford, nj ufo observation report february 02, 2009 i have been observing an object in the evening sky which strobes occasionally (white, green, blue and red), and is almost impossible to focus in on with binoculars (7x35 power). when close to focus the object looks like a cone or jellyfish with colors continually changing. no sound. this object moves erratically and quickly, up, down and left right also in circles but, stays within a boundary of approximately 5 miles (educated guess). the objects position is typically trailing the constellation of the big dipper in the eastern skies starting at approximately 15-20 degrees above the horizon at 18:00 hours and then moving in the same trajectory as the big dipper later into the evening. a guess that it is at 50 to 100,000 feet above sea level. this has been observed for the last 60 days by me and others that have observed it with me, so i have decided to report it."],"Date of the Event":"02/01/2009 07:59 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"04:00:00","Object Shape":"Cone, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15269.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15269.html"],"Longitude":"-74.396261","Date Submitted":"02/01/2009 07:59 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15269","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.062644,+-74.396261(15269)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15269) map </A>","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-02022009-0017","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.062644","Summary":"This object moves erratically and quickly, up, down and left right also in circles but, stays within a boundary of approximately 5 miles (educated guess).","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON"}
