{"Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my house and received a phone call from a friend telling me to go outside. I went outside and looked in the sky and there was what, at first, appeared to be a plane. It was flashing but the light kept changing colors. It did not move in the sky. We (my friend and I) got in my car and started driving towards it, soon realizing that its location was too far away to reach. We turned around and returned to my house. It was still in the sky (It was way too high to be a tower. It wasn't moving so it was not a plane. It was flashing different colored lights so it was not a star or meteor)."],"Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.961325","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/06/2010 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/06/2010 01:24 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-75.159789","Case Number":"22168","Log Number":"US-03062010-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.961325,+-75.159789(22168)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22168) map </A>","Summary":"Saw multi-colored flashing star-like object in night sky.","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Philadelphia","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around March 6th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22168.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22168.html"]}
