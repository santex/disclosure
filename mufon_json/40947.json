I was headed into the store when I saw this in the sky at 10:35 pm. I thought it was some of those lanterns that you can get during the 4th of July. I went in the store to get others to see it but couldn't find anyone close enough so I went back outside and when I got back outside they were gone. That led me to believe it wasn't the lanterns because you can see those up in the sky for quite a while."],"Region":"Missouri","Longitude":"-94.247649","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07202012-0008","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Case Number":"40947","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.033896","City":"Blue Springs","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.033896,+-94.247649(40947)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40947) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"4 bright lights moving across the sky at night","Date of the Event":"07/15/2012 10:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40947.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40947.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"07/20/2012 11:59 UTC"}
