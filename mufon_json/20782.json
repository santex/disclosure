I noticed the object by chance due to the fact that it was not flying at an altitude taken by approaching or departing helicopers, airplanes,though infrequent,flew much higher. the object was approx 1 mile off the water, I was facing land. The object appeared to be approx 2 miles away from me,it was close enough to see that it appeared to be a \"classic\" flying saucer, disc shaped with a round dome on top. The sides of the dome were straight coming off the disk a little bit, then rounded out into the dome. The object was shiny silver metallic. It flew straight with no attitude adjustments at about 10 mph. I watched it for about 3 minutes before it dissapeared into a cloud. It was a sunny day, visibility was unlimited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.27245,+-89.365577(20782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20782) map </A>","Region":"Louisiana","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date Submitted":"11/28/2009 10:47 UTC","Case Number":"20782","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-89.365577","Log Number":"US-11282009-0017","Latitude":"29.27245","Summary":"disc shaped object with round dome on top","Object Features":"Dome","trends":["There has been one other sighting in venice","There were no other sightings in venice on or around March 10th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
