my memory is of being on a sort of hospital bed and of someone leaning over me with a long hypodermic needle and sticking it into the centre of my eye. doug remembered a lot more about what happened than i did and he was terrified. he had nightmares for months after. we agreed that based on the section of the ship that we could see ( which could have been more than the wing span of a dash 8 airplane, based on the assumption that the dark humanoid shapes were the actual size of us humans) it could have easily been only one-half or even one-quarter of the whole thing. i have seen a number of documentaries on tv about different types of et craft, but have never seen this huge dart-like shape anywhere. it was a small city. we returned to toronto in the hopes of telling someone, but even the cops didn't what to hear of any of that stuff at the time. then we discovered that each of us had a souvenir of our experience. doug discovered a mysterious lump under the skin on his hand. at that time i mentioned that i had a lump too, only mine was put on my chest! we both have implants. my implant has puzzled many doctors over the years as it show an x-rays, bone scan and mri. they said it must be metal in me. about 10 years ago a doctor was going to make a small incision to remove this metal, when he stopped and called an other doctor into the room, and he concurred; the thing under my skin actually moved away every time the doctor even brought the scalpel near the protrusion. over the years this lump (about 1\\4 inch wide to 1\\2 inch long appearing oblong at times, otherwise rounded) and will get very big at times, so big that it shows through light shirts, then will shrink until barely noticeable at other times. i have known what this is and have carried it for years, still where they put it. please help! i want this removed and will give this implant to anyone who would want it for research."],"Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.49587,+-81.00722(6161)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6161) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/15/1982 02:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/15/1982 02:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6161.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6161.html"]}
