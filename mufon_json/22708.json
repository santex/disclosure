{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was approximately 10:30 pm -10:45 pm my daughther and I were outside watering the grass. For no apparent reason I looked west up to the sky and at the moment saw 3 bright lights. At first, I thought to my self they were 3 bright stars all lined up horizontal. Suddenly a 4th light appeared, so I said to my self ..(oh its a plane). Then a 5th light appeared, which made me realize this was no plane..for they were not flashing, moving, nor there wasn't any noise. My gut feeling just told me this is ..Weird. I told my daughter who is 11 yrs old ..Mija come here quick and look at the lights but all she got to see was 1 light, due to they dissappeared so quickly as they had appeared. I dont know if what I saw is an UFO or what , but I know I saw something that its gonna be in my head for many days and nights to come...What was it ? Dont know..but I do know that I have seen something that is unexplained in the sky. This is my true story, no I am not insane , nor take drugs, drink, smoke , etc. Call it as u wish."],"City":"Laredo","Date of the Event":"04/07/2010 10:35 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22708.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22708.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Laredo","There were no other sightings in Laredo on or around April 7th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"27.512977","Tags":"City","Case Number":"22708","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright lights in the sky.","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-04082010-0009","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/08/2010 03:22 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.512977,+-99.498392(22708)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22708) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-99.498392"}
