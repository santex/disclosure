It seemed to be glowing in a yellow, almost orange color. At first i thought it was a helicopter until it actually crossed over the tree line and there was no sound and i realized it was silent. I was frozen in shock as it seemed to drift in a semi circle around the field the pick up speed and head across the interstate toward the cornfields. When it was out of sight i ran to get my phone to call my brother who was staying on the other side of town and told him to look north in the sky. It was gone. The object was the size of three SUVs strung together and made no noise but i felt like it knew i was watching. I've never been more terrified in my life."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/01/2010 01:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-10282010-0029","Tags":"City","City":"Liberty","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-94.417018","Latitude":"39.249174"}
