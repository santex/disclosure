I looked up at the sky and seen an airplane. After it had passed i was looking for shooting stars when i seen to my north five or six flashing stars consecutively lighting up in a straight line. I ran inside and got my girlfriend to come see it too. We both watched it anywhere from 2-3 minutes. the line seen to be moving east. Hard to tell how far up it was. no cloud cover, and difficult to gauge the size. All i can say is they looked like stars, only brighter (when lit) and moving. Very strange. we are both college educated people, and know the difference between an airplane, stars, and something out of the ordinary."],"Country":"United States","City":"Washburn"}
