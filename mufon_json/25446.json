I looked up and saw the object. It was round with multicolored lights shining. I thought the lights looked like they were coming from windows. It's always reminded me of a mother's ring, the ones that are a band with small gemstones in a line. I didn't hear any noise but it seemed to be hovering quite high. It was definitely standing still when I saw it."]}
