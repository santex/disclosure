{"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was about 3:15am or so and I was watching a meteor shower looking north from south El Cajon ,I saw a helicopter fly from Santee to west El Cajon ,about 15 min later I saw from overhead and to the north a meteorite zip in and stop 100'-200' above the ground, I watched it for about 5 min fly around like a bug at a street light before I tried to get someone else to see it,I ran down stairs and remembered it was to late to get the neighbors so I ran back up stairs and continued to watch it ,then I noticed what looked like molten medal pour from it when it would stop and hover, it would fly around like a bug then stop and hover and drop this stuff, about 15 min in to this it got real bright and flashed out,I sat there for about 10 min and saw nothing ,I went back in my apartment and sat by the window and waited another 10 min or so and saw a flash like cloud to cloud lightning and went back out also had a high pitch ringing in my middle ear \"may not be related\" ,there was another big flash and it came back as a small light ,it grew like cell under a microscope with time laps photograph back to it original size and went back to doing what it had been doing ,about 10 min later it pulsated 3 big flashes and split in to 2 ,they flew like 2 planets in each others gravity spinning together and at the same time still flying around like bug's and at times they would spin apart and fly alone but still with in 100 yards of each other,this went on for 10-15 min, then they both stopped and and flew at each other merging back in to 1 it flew around for another 10 min or so and then flew to the north west at high speed toward MMNAS ,shortly after that 5-10 min the helicopter flew back over there and flew around the area for about 5min ,by this time I was so flipped out I called the police lol ,I asked if anyone had reported any lights in the sky the woman said no and asked me if I wanted to make a report I said no..later I talked to other that had seen same thing on different night's and even years before and years later.."],"Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31524.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.797023,+-116.959717(31524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31524) map </A>","Longitude":"-116.959717","Summary":"it was and amber ball of light that split in to 2 then merged back into 1 and flew away.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"El Cajon","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/04/2011 04:28 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/16/1993 03:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-09042011-0026","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in El Cajon","There were no other sightings in El Cajon on or around November 16th 1993"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"31524","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"32.797023"}
