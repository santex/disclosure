He looks up and sees two lights moving north east at a steady pace. I looked up and saw the two lights start to rotate and one light move in front of the other. The lights were around 100 yards off the ground maybe more. We could not tell if there was an object attached to the two lights. If it was an object it was rectangular in shape. The two lights became one and continued moving north east. There was no sound."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown"}
