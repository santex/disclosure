There was absolutely no sound, and they hovered for about 90 seconds before starting to move very precisely in a slow spiral going up and to the northwest. They all moved at precisely the same speed, and as they reached a certain point in the spiral one would break off and move in a straight line off to the northwest and just dwindle into nothing (I don't know if they were moving into the clouds or what). It took about 3 minutes for all five to fade out completely, but one would be gone before the next would move off.��� My mother in law and 4 year old son were in the car with me, and an SUV behind me stopped to ask what they were.���"],"Longitude":"-119.860827","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Fresno","There were no other sightings in Fresno on or around January 23rd 2013"],"Date Submitted":"01/23/2013 11:17 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
