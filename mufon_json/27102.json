Airport is close to our home, so I always watch the take offs and landing planes in the night sky. All airplanes have blinking lights, either during take off, or landing. This evening, however, a bright star got my attention because it had no blinking lights, did not have the shape of an airplane but moved across the sky, coming from direction of Orlando airport, moving at steady but medium-slow pace, heading NE (toward UCF.) I watched this thing carefully, hoping to see some blinking lights or hear any noise after all, but neither happened. It was funny to see a bright big star move across the sky silently, at Christmas time. -Thought I report it."],"Summary":"starlike ufo near airport","Date of the Event":"12/24/2010 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
