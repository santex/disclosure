I often look out my window at the sky at night. I am awake at night and sleep during the day. For some teson I randomly looked at the time on my phone and then looked out my window I noticed a bright bluish star that was brighter than the rest it didnt appear to be moving at first and then I noticed it was moving horizontal to the tree line. It faded out and was gone in about a minute. I am surprised I looked out the window when I did and caught it. It made me wonder how often this happens unoticed. It wasnt a flair, shooting star, or satalite. I have seen all of those before countless times. I am not sure what it was. Later this year my son and the kids at the bus stop saw something similar. That is what made me decide to report this. Lucky I had written about it in my journal."],"Date Submitted":"10/24/2012 03:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Pretty blue bright star moving horizontal above the tree line.","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"06/02/2012 04:06 UTC","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Salina","There were no other sightings in Salina on or around June 2nd 2012"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Kansas","Case Number":"43492","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43492.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43492.html"],"Latitude":"38.846828","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Salina","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10242012-0002"}
