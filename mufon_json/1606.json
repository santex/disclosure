From2130 to 2215 hours observed 2 yellowish-orange lights in the S-SW sky facingtowards Gila Bend, AZ. I am familiar with the lighting configurations ofaircraft and this seemed out of the ordinary. I parked the car off the road towatch out of curiosity. The 2 lights were hovering motionless and wouldgradually dim and burn out completely. Then they would reappear 5-10 minuteslater. Sometimes only one would appear. I observed this cycle for 45 minutes toan hour. I estimate their distance at 30 miles from me, but they may easily havebeen farther away, perhaps in the military airspace near Gila Bend (where I sawthem at a shorter distance the first time).When I got tired of waiting for thelights to reappear, I started to drive home and they appeared again. Theseunusual lights are not uncommon in Arizona. The news media in Phoenix have beenmentioning these lights for several years now."],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed"}
