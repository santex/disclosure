Got my camera so I could enlarge. Put on night mode (Samsung Galaxy 4). Once enlarged I could make out the shape and lights much clearer. Disc shape with top and bottom domes. I also saw what looked like little stars or balls of light around it coming and going (almost reminded me of swarming mosquitoes), one turned a bright red for just a second. Kept moving in a line further away until I could not see anymore (took about an hour from when I first noticed it). Disappeared out of sight or went behind trees I could not tell which happened first. Lucky to see it by about 12:40 it became overcast in our area."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51029.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51029.html"],"Object Features":"Dome","Longitude":"-86.721971","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09242013-0005","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"Looking at stars noticed blinking got my samsung galaxy 4 to take pic and enlarge","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
