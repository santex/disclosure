We were sitting at the top while people below were loading. I was looking to my left at people on another ride when my 5 yr old daughter kept pulling at my arm telling me to \"look at the shooting star\". When I finally looked to my right I saw what looked like a shooting star or meteor entering the atmosphere. I saw one very bright light and then suddenly there were 3 more lights under the bright light. They didn't seem to move and seemed very still. I then reached for my camera phone and took several pictures which I currently have on my phone. The Ferris wheel circled approx 3 times and I took pictures each round until the ride was over. I lost track of the lights after exiting the ride."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-94.569467","Log Number":"US-08282009-0002","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/21/2009 09:00 UTC","Case Number":"18921","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Kansas City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.104946,+-94.569467(18921)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18921) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/21/2009 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.104946","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Region":"Missouri","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 2 other sightings in Kansas City on or around August 21st 2009"]}
