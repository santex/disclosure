I turned to look where it came from and saw a couple standing outside their car in the parking lot pointing up at the sky, then I saw another flash. When I looked up I realized what we were all looking at was a normal looking cloud cover but you could clearly make out red flashes of light coming from above them. The flashes changed from red to yellow at times, but it was definately not lighting, and you could tell from the reaction of the others that they felt the same thing. The cloud just continued on it's course, sometimes flashing red, then yellow, until it just stopped. If you have ever seen \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", it was similar to the part when the small boy is abducted by the moving, flashing cloud covering the UFO."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26767.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26767.html"],"Log Number":"US-11282010-0001","Case Number":"26767","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-112.444104","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Lit Cloud","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
