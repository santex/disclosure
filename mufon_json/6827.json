We both noticed a brilliantly shining silver object flying very slowly at low altitude at a perpendicular angle to our course. It looked as if it was producing it's own light. We could not make out the shape of the object due to the shear intensity of the light it produced. We watched it for about 2 minutes when it quite suddenly disappeared before our eyes. It did not move beyond our range of sight. It simply faded over a period of 2 seconds, and then disappeared completely."],"Country":"United States","trends":[],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"31.972239","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/01/2007 01:02 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/01/2007 01:02 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright silver light/craft disappeares before our eyes-- South Austin","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-99.892233"}
