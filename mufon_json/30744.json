{"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.265145","divs":["sighting detailson the night of august 4 2011 i saw flying lights at around 845 pm in kingman arizona. i was driving down the road and i was facing east. i saw 4 strange lights in a weird pattern i decided that something was not right so i knew the road i was on went out into the desert so i went about 5 miles out of town and now there was 8 lights in the sky in different patterns from horizontal lines to rectangles to circles. as soon as i got to the desert there was another car already out there and one soon showed up and then a few minutes later there was 4-5 cars including mine. having a truck and it being the desert i went out as far as i could and i go to i would say about 2 miles away. i was standing lights of and i knew they were not airplanes because they were just sitting there but being so close i also didn���������t hear any helicopter noises i took a bunch of pictures and the last one was when they were in a rectangle and then they started to circle the city it seemed and then they all started going towards the ground and where most of them flew i knew there was departments so i decided to head out that way and i think i saw one on the ground but as soon as i parked my car a cop seemed to appear out of nowhere and he asked me if i had a problem i responded if i was trespassing and he said i wasn���������t and so i started to tell him about the lights and showed him the pictures. he then proceeded to tell me that there are new aircraft that hover and don���������t make noise but i haven���������t heard of anything like that. i said i should go and he goes good idea and as i was turning my car around he turned left to go where the lights had seemed to land. the whole cop thing seemed rather suspicious and it just didn���������t feel right i was out in the middle of nowhere and i didn���������t even see him coming but take that for what it is worth. i then went home and looked up the number to call and report i tried calling a couple of times and it was busy and then i started to see the lights again this time they were heading south and they were in a horizontal formation i went had gotten gas and that���������s when i tried take more pictures and only one came out and it seems really weird. when i was looking at the lights i was able to get through and the person told me to try and get as many people to look and report. i got in my car and started to head south but they just seemed to disappear rather quickly i saw them and then i didn���������t see them i tried waiting around but then i had to be somewhere at midnight that is why i am writing the report so late. i will include pics in the email and try and describe them. the lights every time i saw them where just white and they did blink but only sometimes and i didn���������t see any other color. also no noise at all and moved methodically 1. i was in my car driving east but the picture is sorta north bad pic 2. weird s shape i am about 4-8 miles away first sighting facing east 3.after they started circling one was left faceing east 4. the red thing is what i saw on ground only pic i

http:\\\\kdminer.com\\main.asp?sectionid=1&subsectionid=1&articleid=46095 my name is micheal baca my phone is 928 377 2883 i have been making calls and doing research and you are going to want to talk about this or do more research. i called kingman airports fleet commander and he said that there were no aircraft from kingman in the sky that night. so i decided to call the 3 closest millitary bases and the marine air base and nellis said that they had no aircraft over kingman that night. i then called luke air force base and the person told me that they were probably just flares set off by a 10 warthogs which is the same reason they gave for the 1997 phoenix lights case. i am trying to make this go viral but these circumstances and getting weird."],"Tags":"City","Date of the
