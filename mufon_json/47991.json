It came in from the NW and faded in the NE, it was completely silent and it was able to move across the sky within 10 seconds (it appeared to be travelling much faster than normally observed planes or satellites). The 4-5 people who saw this were explaining what they had just seen to people who had not seen it, when one of the people pointed to the sky and said, \"Do you mean like that?\". At that point 3 more people were able to see a second object which appeared to be the same type of object and nearly the exact same flight path. The night was not cloudy and the lights on the object appeared to be dim compared to normal airplane lights. The object itself was not visible, but the lights look like one light on the front with 3 to 4 lights extending down each wing."],"Latitude":"43.604933","Object Features":"Wings","City":"Midland","Longitude":"-84.18495","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"04/27/2013 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Triange of lights moving quickly and silently in straight line.
