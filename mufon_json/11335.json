I noticed a dark object moving high in the sky that I thought was a very rapidly moving object or airplane. I started to watch it more closely with my binoculars set at 10x zoom. A dark-colored traditional disk shape moving from west to east fairly fast. The disk stopped and hovered (East North East of my location) as it changed shape slowly into a shiny ovoid (possibly turning over and over or shape shifting) and back and forth. The UFO then appeared to move out of range further to the east. Duration 2-3 minutes total. This was followed by a second silver disk shape appearing due east of me and near to a jet that was flying south to north. The UFO vanished. Duration 1-2 minutes total."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Dark Colored disk shape that changed into a shiny silver ovoid.","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/28/2008 04:55 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11335.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11335_submitter_file4__P7120013.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11335_submitter_file5__P7120012.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11335.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.932262","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Fortville","Date Submitted":"06/28/2008 04:55 UTC"}
