{"divs":["Sighting DetailsJuly 15th, 2007, 4:30 am California time: witnessed a large bright light traveling north in a straight line, eventually fading from view behind mountain range in north west San Bernardino. Object looked like a very bright star, but brighter than all the other stars. Extremly bright. Traveled silently as fast as a jet, but slower than a falling star. It was higher than air traffic in this area, but lower than the stars. Pace was constant and trajectory was smooth with no deviation. No trail. I had woken up from a dream involving the mountains and went outside to journal my dream. I had been looking at the night sky (dusting of clouds and stars) and then began writing. The star I had noticed a moment before started moving as described. I was startled and thought, \"Oh, that wasn't a star, but how did I miss that?\". Then I just watched it thinking, \"I've never seen a plane move in that direction, nor travel in that direction.\" I strained to listen for sound, but it was completely silent. I thought it was a ufo."],"City":"San Bernardino","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.112535,+-117.281985(7452)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7452) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07152007-0012","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"07/15/2007 04:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"07/15/2007 04:30 UTC","Case Number":"7452","Longitude":"-117.281985","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7452.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7452.html"],"Summary":"Bright noiseless light traveling north","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in San Bernardino","There were no other sightings in San Bernardino on or around July 15th 2007"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"34.112535"}
