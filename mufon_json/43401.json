At first i thought it was Orion's belt tipped on its side but then I realized that they were blinking red white and blue lights and were hovering equidistant from eachother. When my girlfriend and I got home we got out of the car and observed for thirty minutes while they blinked and hovered. They seemed to be moving very slowly south, maybe southeast. Alongside the three vertical lights were two of the same lined up equal distant from the middle vertical light to form a diamond shape. The lights flashed intermittedly and when we looked behind us there were several other hovering blinking lights in groups to the north and west of us."],"City":"Albertville","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"10/20/2012 01:24 UTC"}
