I neew it was not a tower of enything right off and not a plane or helicopter it was hovering and moving from east to west at a real slow pace . as i got almost under it i could see that it was a triangel shape with round discarge jets all around the perimiter and a big round port in the center that had a bright flashing light . when it flashed about every second you could see glowing air or vapors coming out of the outside jets . like a flame coming out of a jet ingen up close but it was not a flame is looked like gloing vapors or air . I almost went off the road watching it and i was going to pull over to watch it or take a picture but when i looked in my rear view mirror i saw the car behind me almost loose control of there car to trying to watch it . the hiway keepet turning slite lee and i saw it for a few more seconds in my mirror and by then it was over the south bound lane .
