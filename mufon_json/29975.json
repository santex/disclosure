Around 9:40pm we noticed two bright red lights off in the distance. They were very bright, and for a second we thought they were some sort of firework. But, we had never seen any firework like that before. This was different, the lights hovered for a few seconds and in slow motion started to desend vertically. The light was so bright that it caused the light to stretch out and cause a cross in each light. When it began to desend it appeared that there was some smoke rising above the object as an exhaust of some sort. I was confused, shocked, and scared at what I was seeing. My boyfriend was confused as to what it was also, but chalked it up to being fireworks. We did get a picture of one of the lights before it was out of sight, but we lost sight of both the objects when it went below the tree line."],"Case Number":"29975","Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 09:40 UTC","City":"Edison","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08042011-0070"}
