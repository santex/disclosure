{"divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting in our backyard I noticed one UFO flying at a distance through the trees in my neighbor's yard. Thought it was too bright and orange to be a plane or helicopter. Walked around to to get a better view and then noticed 2nd ufo, exact same color and size, flying slightly behind the first at about 8 o'clock. I freaked out and asked my wife, 'what the hell is that?' They flew a little closer in a northwestern direction, slowed and then stopped completely. Very bright and very orange. At this point I knew we were seeing something strange. Both objects hovered over area of Chico, CA for about about 2 minutes. 2nd UFO faded and then disappeared. 1st UFO lasted about 10 seconds longer and then quickly disappeared. We were very shocked and amazed."],"Date Submitted":"04/08/2012 02:16 UTC","Summary":"2 bright glowing orange orbs","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.730654","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Case Number":"37192","Log Number":"US-04082012-0004","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-121.828768","Region":"California","City":"Chico","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37192.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37192_submitter_file1__IMAG0299.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37192.html"],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Chico","There were no other sightings in Chico on or around April 7th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"04/07/2012 10:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.730654,+-121.828768(37192)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37192) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
