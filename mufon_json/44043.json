While I was in the middle of talking to my friend, I happened to notice something at the corner of my eye. I thought at first it was a shooting star. But it wasn't. It was a quick 2.5 second angled straight-line path in the sky. I litterally gasped and point in an angle NW above my friend's head. I happened to notice but my friend was exactly a second too late at that time. I got over excited about it and jumped in the air because I have never really got to see anything like it before in my life. I lost site of the object because it disappeared into thin air pretty quickly as soon as my friend turned around."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.388969,+-72.029554(44043)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44043) map </A>","Region":"Connecticut","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other,Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"White, larger than a quarter coin-like size, straight angle-like path then disappeared within about 2.5 secs.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/19/2012 10:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"41.388969","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less"}
