(it's been kind of hot on the central coast today) 2)I Looked up and saw some lights ...weird because they were strange bright lights that I have never seen before and the craft made no noise.. 3) A plane 4) It seemed to accelerate...but the thing that made me most take notice that it was joined by two other objects (very bright lights) that seemed to accompany this craft into space.... 5) It was a very unsettling experience...kind of wish I did not see it.. 6) They just faded away... Hope this helps, I'm just really interested if anybody else seen this.
