{"City":"Schererville","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were walking our dog when we noticed two red-orange globes of light flying in the sky in what looked like a circling path of a single area, yet they would disappear for a number of minutes then reappear. We checked back in 15 minutes, and they had disappeared. I have never seen anything like this in my life. These were definitely not airplanes, helicopters, or any type of drones. Very shocked and at a loss of words at what i just saw."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-87.45349","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"05/16/2012 08:45 UTC","Latitude":"41.483365","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"red-orange colored globes of light seen in sky around 845 p,m. while walking dog","Tags":"City","Region":"Indiana","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"38188","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38188.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38188.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.483365,+-87.45349(38188)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38188) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05162012-0013","Date Submitted":"05/16/2012 10:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Schererville","There were no other sightings in Schererville on or around May 16th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
