All three lights remained in a constant triangular formation relative to one another for the duration of the sighting. Within about a 5 minute time of observing them, they gradually were obscured from our sight, by barely thick enough clouds, so that when they were no longer visible, no more sightings were seen after (damn the luck of the clouds that night). I am careful about characterizing any sightings in the sky as UFOs as I am a frequent sky watcher, day or night. I am positive that what I saw, and 4 other people also saw, whom I had called their attentions to observe, were 3 red lights that certainly were not airplanes or jets, helicopters or weather balloons."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/21/2007 11:05 UTC","Summary":"3 non-blinking red lights were visible in the S.
