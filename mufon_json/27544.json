The looked like lit christmas trees standing upright blinking with red, white and blue lights. Very bright and they were too close for comfort maybe 7-800 feet up.I could count a total of 7 ships. They moved slowly and separately in different areas around me. I called for co-workers to come out and they came within a minute and thank god saw the same thing confirming I have not lost my marbles. I have seen 2 similar ships very close before but these looked larger in size and more lights on them. It is difficult to explain but I could feel that these were not earthly so to speak. This being very close to St:Josephs hospital which is always busy there must have been more people that saw this than us ( we were a total of 8 witnesses) I had to go back in to work but as I did they were still there hovering. I saw them close to 50 min."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27544.html"],"trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Burbank","There were no other sightings in Burbank on or around January 28th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.303526","Latitude":"34.182939","Case Number":"27544","Country":"United States","Region":"California","City":"Burbank","Object Shape":"Triangle, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.182939,+-118.303526(27544)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27544) map </A>"}
