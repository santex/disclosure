{"divs":["sighting detailsit was a cold and overcast day . nov.21, 2007 at 1:50 pm . i was returning home from deer hunting in the pierre-marquette forest. while traveling n. on 140th ave. approximately 1\\4 mil before reaching 19 mile road. i had just crested a hill in an open area of hay fields, when i noticed directly in front of me and about a mile away, what could best be described as a huge strangely illuminated ,glowing, triangular object in the sky just below the cloud ceiling. the outer perimeters of which appeared to be illuminated (mixture of pale, satiny white, greyish white, ) with the center of the object semi transparent and the same color as the sky. it actually looked like the sky was in the center of the triangle somehow. (like a glowing pool ball rack) the object was moving from west to east, and was only visible for a few seconds . i had to accelerate to get past a tree line in hopes of catching a glimpse of it again. i turned east onto 19 mile road and did not view it again until i reached an area of open power lines. at which time i only caught a glimpse of it . i first overshot the power lines and had to brake and reverse to catch a fleeting glimpse as the rearmost section of the craft was swallowed up by the clouds. i could not hear any sounds but my truck was running at the time. i was shocked by the size of this object and my first thought was of possibly some sort of object crashing into the earth. but quickly realized it was on a level trajectory and appeared to be under power. i must admit i was quite shocked and upset by what i had seen and tried to notify someone but kept getting recordings etc. so my brother who also had a sighting many years ago suggested i notify mufon while it was still fresh in my memory."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/21/2007 01:50 UTC","City":"Le Roy","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Le Roy","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8551.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8551.html"],"Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"8551","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date of the Event":"11/21/2007 01:50 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.038069","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.038069,+-85.45394(8551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8551) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12042007-0002","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"I observed a huge glowing triangle in the sky below the cloud ceiling.","Longitude":"-85.45394"}
