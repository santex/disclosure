We continue to go out when I get that feeling to do so. Some times we have many to photograph and sometimes there are only a few. It is a rare occasion when we don't have any. The rays you will see in the one picture happened when I was expreimenting in calling them to me. You will notice that in the pictures of the green orb the background is in focus but the orb is not, indicating that it is moving. We have found that there is something similar in all the pictures that seems to be far away in the background. If it is very dark out I need some light source from somewhere. At dusk I don't need any light source."],"Log Number":"US-09212012-0020","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42710.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42710.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Case Number":"42710","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"43.807893","Longitude":"-120.546491","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Multiple white orbs and rapidly moving green orb, multi colored rays","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oregon","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.807893,+-120.546491(42710)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42710) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
