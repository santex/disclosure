While taking the picture he says there seemed to be something over to the left side of the field of vision that quickly flew by, but wasn't sure. When the pictues were reviewed later it was noticed this particular one attached had the object in the left side seemingly about 40-50 feet above a 30-40 foot fishing boat. That is all he knows. He wants to know what it is, if it is an actual USO, or UFO, or a bird.
