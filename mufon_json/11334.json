First I thought it was a helicopter, but it was moving to slowly , and i tried to listen for any noise coming from it , but it was silent. It was hovering slowly above the tree line about one mile away. We thought that is was not like anything we had seen before, because the lights were solid and stacked one on top of another with a space in between and the object seemed to be very large, maybe the size of a grey-hound bus. We turned north onto another road and then East again, moving closer to the object as the object descended downward and we lost site of through the trees. But this isnt the first time we've seen ufo's in this area , but it was the first time my oldest daughter seen what she thought was a ufo."],"Latitude":"30.358251","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11334","Region":"Louisiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11334.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11334.html"],"Summary":"Two solid red lights stacked one on top of another","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/27/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-90.065631","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Tags":"City"}
