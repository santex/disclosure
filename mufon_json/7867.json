Playing around with my video camera, I thought I spied a gleaming white ufo hovering in a cloud bank. Not too sure. This camera, though New is pretty small. I'm going to try to attach the video to this and let you be the judge. If I was mistaken, I do apologize. This little section of West Virginia seems to be a hotbed of activity. I've spied 1 gleaming white sombrero typed craft. 3 black triangulars. And 1 gleaming white diamond shaped craft. Someone should come down here around Rt 104 near the Princeton Church of God to check it out."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7867.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7867.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09082007-0006","Latitude":"37.372469","Case Number":"7867","Date of the Event":"09/08/2007 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/08/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Possible UFO.
