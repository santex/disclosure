{"Log Number":"US-10262008-0002","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at a friends house by george washington highschool with my wife and son. My wife was in the backyard and I was in the kitchen by the back door I heard some planes go by over head headed from south to north my wife later told me that they were military jets. as the jets were going by she motioned me to come out side and pointed south in the sky and asked me \" are those birds?\" I looked and didn't see anything at first then I saw two circle objects way off in the distince weaving in and out like a figure 8 type pattern. I told her that they couldn't be birds because at the distince they were at if they were the size of birds we would not be able to see them from where we were at. The two dots went back and forth from east to west in the figure 8 pattern for about 30-40 seconds then came together in formation the took off west. man it was freaky because the were moving as fast as jets but were way more agile then a jet."],"Date Submitted":"10/25/2008 03:15 UTC","City":"Denver","Region":"Colorado","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around October 25th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"39.747134","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"10/25/2008 03:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"w dots reflecting the sun","Longitude":"-104.979123","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.747134,+-104.979123(13229)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13229) map </A>","Case Number":"13229","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13229.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13229.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
