{"Region":"Pennsylvania","divs":["sighting detailsmy brother in law and i saw stragne red x light pattern in he eastern sky of new brighton, pa as we sat around a camp fire in my backyard. the shape never flashed or blinked and moved from east to west for approxiamately four to five minuets. i held my thumb up to the object and it was between 1\\4 and 1\\2 the size of my thumnail. i eastimated the object to be at least a mile high in the air. due to the fact that it seemed to be above the sparce cloud cover. the red light just faded out of view after the four or five minuet time frame that we were able to observe it. i have been interested in ufo's for a long time and regurlay scan the sky looking for strange things. this is the 1st time that i ever saw anything that i could not identify, the shape did not look or act like any know plane or helicopter or other aviation ship that i am familar with. we both felt like we were viewing something very strange in the sky and we were both convinced that we were viewing something unknown to either of us. jason b."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.732843,+-80.306313(17826)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17826) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07052009-0031","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"New Brighton","Longitude":"-80.306313","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in New Brighton","There were no other sightings in New Brighton on or around July 3rd 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/03/2009 11:15 UTC","Summary":"Strange red X shape in the sky.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"17826","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17826.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17826.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/03/2009 11:15 UTC","Latitude":"40.732843"}
