{"Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting out on the porch enjoying the evening when very bright star appeared moving from the NW ......... Traveled in an apparently straight path to SE and disappeared ........ Object seemed to be wobbling ....... It seemed to blink a couple of times before it disappeared and I thought I saw a smaller bright light zip out .... My impression at first was that it was a satellite .... My wife thought it was a plane, but there was never any sound and it passed at about a 1 O'Clock position over us. My gut feeling is that it was a satellite but it was much brighter than any I have ever seen"],"City":"Sayre","Case Number":"28985","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28985.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/07/2011 12:24 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sayre","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.291162","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-99.640097","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.291162,+-99.640097(28985)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28985) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05072011-0001","Summary":"Bright star traveling NW to SE","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oklahoma","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/06/2011 09:45 UTC"}
