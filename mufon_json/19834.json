I had my camera with me as I usually do. I noticed a bright white round ball in the sky. I began shooting pictures and then took some video footage of this object as it went from right to left (west to east). I would estimate this object as being over a mile away. I continued taping until the object could not be seen as it passed behind the trees. There was no noise that i could detect. It also looked to be shimmering, or reflective."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19834.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19834_submitter_file1__DSC05982a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19834_submitter_file2__DSC05979.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19834.html"],"Longitude":"-82.418644","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/06/2009 03:05 UTC"}
