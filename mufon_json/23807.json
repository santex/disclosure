I am often awake around 2am, so I was last night (this morning). I sleep in the attic under a non-insulated roof and can hear outside sounds very clearly. It happened very fast -- the sound of something WHOOSHing overhead. Gliders don't fly at night, do they? It was a few seconds at the most. Although cars sometimes drive by late at night, they take much longer to go by and then fade away. No engine noise could be heard. It was calm, no wind. Then about a minute later I heard a few distant bangs or booms. I listened for more, but that's it! From my first instinctive impression of the sound, it was something moving fairly fast and fairly low, maybe a few hundred feet up?"],"Log Number":"US-06182010-0002","Date Submitted":"06/18/2010 12:09 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.770766","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23807.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23807.html"],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Nashua","There were no other sightings in Nashua on or around June 18th 2010"]}
