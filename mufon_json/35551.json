So I took a picture of it. After loading it into the computer and enlarging it I noticed that it was not like any helicopter I've ever seen and after enlarging it, It did not look like a helicopter at all. Are we wittnessing the real life beginnings of an alien tranformers type deception. I know that this was not a helicopter, but what I'm asking is what is it exactly? This is no joke. I believe that they are now imitating conventional craft to fly through our air space. I could be wrong, but prove me wrong!"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.988384,+-94.480168(35551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35551) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
