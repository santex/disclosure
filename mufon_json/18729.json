We stopped and started looking for the source, but there was nothing. A few seconds later, another bright flash appeared, but already in different place - it moved to the North I think. We saw approximately 5-7 flashes and it took 2-3 minutes at all. The distance between them was about 15-20 seconds. I have read a report from Great Britain, dated the same day, and think that we saw same object."],"Tags":"City","Country":"Estonia"}
