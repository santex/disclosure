It seemed too bright to be an airplane. It came at a slow pace, then seemed to ascend maybe a thousand feet in height off the ground. The object then slowed down to almost a standstill. seemed to hover but still progressed very slowly. The light that was being emitted then dialed down. kind of like you can change the brightness on some lamps in your house. After the light dialed down, the object picked up a whole lot of speed and continued to the north progressively getting faster and faster. then lost sight of it behind a house. Myself and my wife are witnesses to this event. It happened too fast to grab my phone to take a picture or video."],"Source":"MUFON"}
