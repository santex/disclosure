I turned to look at light near a neighbor's home and noticed a light that looked odd. It was still quite far away, I would say nearly 1.5-2 miles east of US17-92 at that point. It floated closer to us at a very slow rate (taking about 7-8 minutes), as it got closer it began to resemble a fireball. Like if you were able to ignite a balloon and keep it in the air. It was flying at a low altitude, maybe 600-700 ft. As the object moved north, it seemed to rotate, and change direction around the fireworks. It then seemed to stop and hover for nearly 2-3 minutes, until it just kind of lifted into the air and moved very quickly out of sight. My fiancee and I stopped and looked at at each other with our jaws on the ground and our hair standing up, wondering what we just saw. We ran into the house to grab binoculars; when we returned, we noticed that there were several planes at different altitudes, and different speeds circling over."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40169.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40169.html"],"Log Number":"US-07052012-0007","Source":"MUFON","City":"Orange City","Sighting Duration":"00:12:14"}
