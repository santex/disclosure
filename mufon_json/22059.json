My husband and I were driving around the campus in our local neighborhoods looking for image opportunities. While taking pictures of unusual clouds, I noticed a round rainbow among the clouds in the same part of the sky as the sun. Additionally there seemed to be two intersecting lines of clouds that resembled a cross and at the intersection, a small oval shaped rainbow, brighter than the rest of the sky except the sun to my right. I took about 7 pictures of this unusual phenomenon thinking I had caught a strange rainbow. Later when I downloaded the pictures from camera to computer, the first two pictures of this multi-colored phenomenon clearly shows a round, can-like object in the sky. I did not see the object with the my naked eye. I only saw the objects after I downloaded the pictures on my computer."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO"}
