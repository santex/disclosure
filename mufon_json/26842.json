Suddenly a bright disk as huge as 5 stadiums enterred the sphere brightly. after 2 seconds turned left in a 90 degrees L shape flightwith dark fuselage,as if to evade the withnessees asap. No sound effect was heared. The Giant UFO disappeared immediately fading out in 2 seconds. I am sure the GUFO was in an ultimately Top-Secret mission from another galaxy. I, as an ufologist could not be allowed to have a closer contact with the crews of the G-UFO. The Topoleuv aircraft's crew could not perceive the upper event at all. There were no trace remained from the GUFO's path. That was an incident to warn me to be away from any celestial demands from human beings for my inventions and so on. I am sorry to have lost the contacts later on I had with the smaller UFOs. Have Ultra-Nice Times.
