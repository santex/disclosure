As I was doing so, the screen started to flicker, andthe lights dimmed a little. Curious as to what happened, I got up and examinedthe light switch. As I was fiddling with the switch, I heard a faint hummingsound that was growing louder every second. I stepped to the windor and glancedout beyond my neighbors house at the forest just past. Hovering just about thetreeline was an orange, star-shaped object. It was just approximatly passingover the forest when it stopped. Its color changed to a more reddish tint as awhite beam dropped out of the bottom into the forest. This only lasted for afew seconds, followed by the object retracting the beam and then justdisappearing into thin air."],"Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"41.461999","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Middlefield","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.461999,+-81.073708(2672)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2672) map </A>","City":"Middlefield","Longitude":"-81.073708","Object Features":"Louvres, Other","Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"11/10/2003 10:13 UTC"}
