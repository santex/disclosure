For the past few weeks I've been watching the sky for UFOs and usually can distinguish what is a plane or not by the blinking lights on the bottom of the aircraft, and that's what I have been seeing often that I thought was weird. But I was eyeing the sky tonight (this was coincidental since my phone was out of battery so I couldn't record or photograph.) But, as a skeptic, I was eyeing this object as a plane, but then the object light dims in for a brief second, and then out again. It looked like it was traveling due East. This went on for a short duration and then the dimming stopped and the object was gone. I was sort of stunned and surprised by the whole sighting - I have been watching the skies for a while and seen weird things, that I quickly pointed them out as planes, so when I saw that there were no blinking lights emitting from the object, I continued to watch as it dimmed in and out and again and then stopped, with me losing track of it."],"Date of the Event":"08/06/2013 09:02 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/06/2013 10:11 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.041513,+-76.932404(49554)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49554) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Longitude":"-76.932404","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49554.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49554.html"],"Latitude":"39.041513","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Odd Light Dimming In and Out","Log Number":"US-08062013-0036"}
