I have located 8 transport craft that eject orbs or scout craft that appear to follow a preplanned mission. Both craft project a magnitude 3 in brightness, the scout craft are smaller and appear as pinpoints of light. It is impossible to ascertain whether they are luminous or have lights on the exterior structure. The transport craft launch the minute objects and often move toward them to assist in their recovery. As far as equipment, I use a Meade telescope, Canon stabilized binoculars, and a 500 mW green laser. I plan to refine my search and observation methods this summer."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/24/2011 01:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"28387","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.250635,+-75.282646(28387)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28387) map </A>","Latitude":"40.250635"}
