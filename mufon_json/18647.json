As we were about to leave, I pointed out a very bright object that I thought was a star that was quite low in the sky. We looked at it for a few seconds and as we started to walk away , my girlfriend said \"it's moving\" . We watched it move in a straight line for about 45 seconds. It moved under an airplane that was flying overhead and suddenly disappeared. We were both very intrigued beause it was brighter than any star in the sky and had no flashing lights or sound. It was clearly not a plane because it moved much slower than any planes we saw that night. the sky was also completely clear, no clouds."],"City":"Geneva"}
