I was about 5 miles north of Hazelhurst. I know the photos aren't the greatest but I had little time to react and got lucky because for the most part it was very cloudy. It didn't look like a jet or a rocket. It looked more like a bullet shaped aircraft and had a very thick and solid contrail with a line down the center of it. At first I thought it was just spraying a chemtrail but afterwards it seemed more like a high speed space plane to me. It wasted no time on getting out of there and the last photo shows what it left behind."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"45.807778","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Bullet shaped aircraft screams across northern Wisconsin sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21985_submitter_file1__IMG_4484a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21985_submitter_file2__IMG_4486a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21985_submitter_file3__IMG_4503a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21985.html"],"Region":"Wisconsin","City":"Hazelhurst","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-89.725","Date of the Event":"02/22/2010 03:35 UTC"}
