It shot over within a blink of an eye and started to move closer towards the rockford airport direction than my wife and i wanted to get in the car to go chase it but by the time she ran in and got the keys we lost sight of it no cameras no pictures only with our very own eyes this is not the first time we have seen these flying objects but i decided to start recording them now for the sake that people really need to know our government is hiding these ufo's and the true name of our savior is Yahwey and when you start to speak his nameand pray you really do start seeing these things im not joking also you should really look at the clouds sometimes they cloak in our clouds and some can even look like clouds we really need to know the truth and that we are not alone and i think the ancient people knew that also i do believe that we do have a underwater civilization that we dont know of but you can definitely check the records of the navy of USO's. back in egypt as everyone should know we were enslaved by water like creatures and Yahwey helped us escape from there clutches we built false gods and worshipped them, that is against the commandments yahwey gave us and if you believe in the City of Atlantis than this will come to no suprise to you we are definitely not alone!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/02/2010 11:18 UTC","Case Number":"26320","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball, Star-like","Date Submitted":"11/03/2010 02:15 UTC"}
