{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAs my daughter and I were soaking in the hot tub, we noticed a strange looking light in the east sky. As we observed this light, it grew into two lights. At this point I thought, this is a plane coming right at us. However, as it progressed, I knew, this was not a plane. It was very low and silent as it went right over head,not to mention, it was moving way to slow.As it was directly on top of us, a third light was present. Two in the front and one in the rear. It was in the shape of a triangle, with the flat part of the triangle being the front of the craft. We continued to watch it, excitedly, until it continued west out of sight. If only I had the DVR out with us!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.680208,+-85.570423(26399)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26399) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"26399","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Shipshewana","Summary":"silent triangle light formation","Longitude":"-85.570423","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"11/02/2010 11:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"41.680208","Log Number":"US-11062010-0009","Date Submitted":"11/06/2010 07:50 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Shipshewana","There were no other sightings in Shipshewana on or around November 2nd 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26399.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26399.html"]}
