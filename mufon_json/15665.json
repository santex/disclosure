It was coming from St. Lucie and was heading toward Ft. Pierce. I was the only witness to this event, as my parents and brother weren't paying any attention at the time. But as I saw htis object, I became very shocked but excited because I was into the UFO phenomenon and it was a great moment for me. However, at first, I thought it was only a fighter jet, but I then realized that it was noiseless and very bright to be one."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15665.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15665.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/22/2008 05:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Bright and Fast movement.","Log Number":"US-02222009-0019","Longitude":"-80.247536","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Dome"}
