Well I see what looks like a star then I started noticing blinking lights well I chalked it up toa plane well a plane does fly over head but lower than the blinking lights! I look back in the same spot and its still just there blinking! I check all the other stars just to make sure it's not my eyes! Then I look back again and it is like to blinking colored stars dancing around each other rather slow! I walk back inside to grab my I pad to get a picture but you can't see it in the picture and it had moved ever so slightly to the right! It is now 1 11 am and it has moved right again so I have to go down the steps now to see it through the trees! My dog is now refusing to go outside wich is weird for him!"],"Date Submitted":"07/15/2013 01:15 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.437333,+-78.647804(48958)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48958) map </A>"}
