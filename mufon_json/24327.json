At first I thought it was an airplane but noticed it was one solid light as it came overhead. There was no noise. Several family members were watching it as well. We noticed that it moved at a quick and steady pace, heading south. When it was directly over us, the light went out but we could still see it moving south and it looked metalic. As it got further from us, we couldn't see it anymore. My family's first thoughts were that it was possibly the supplies for the space station falling to earth but the way it was traveling looked unusual."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"35.380462","Longitude":"-119.014672","Tags":"City","Summary":"Rectangular orange light, gliding across the sky making no noise.","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in Bakersfield","There were no other sightings in Bakersfield on or around July 4th 2010"],"Case Number":"24327","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
