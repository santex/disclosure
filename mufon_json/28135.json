In the building next to the Union Restaurant. There was another truck there. I was waiting for the instructor to come back from calling from the Union when I looked south east and saw a bright round white light high in the sky. The light started to come straight down at a medium speed. As soon as I saw it coming down I felt like I was going to throw up. Turned the truck on to see the time it was 7:00pm. It took approximately 2 minutes for it too come down where the Union roof blocked the light. The sky was clear and was looking out of the truck window at it."],"Case Number":"28135","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"03/06/2011 07:00 UTC","Summary":"Sky clear noticed a bright round white light falling straight down at a medium speed .","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28135.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28135.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"North Dakota","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.491831,+-100.441924(28135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28135) map </A>","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in McClusky","There were no other sightings in McClusky on or around March 6th 2011"],"Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08092011-0072","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-100.441924"}
