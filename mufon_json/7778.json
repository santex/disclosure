When it sped off is when we saw the green light, before that we noticed it because of the flash but afterwards could only see it was a measly almost reflection glint of metal from the moon and some streetlights. we took pictures of this ufo and left our disposable camera in the car. we stayed at the travel lodge near the airport and the next morning when we woke up, our car with the camera had been stolen. coincednece or not we arent sure, but we ne3ver found our car, and nonetheless it proved to be a firghtening experience."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08282007-0014"}
