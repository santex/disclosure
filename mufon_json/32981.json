{"divs":["sighting detailsi was travelling alone in my car on either highway 60 or 10 from riverside county to los angeles county. the approximate time was 6:30am; twilight dawn near the city of fontana or in that general area. while driving, i noticed a lof the cars in front of me start to brake and slow down. the opposing traffic was doing the same. i thought there was an auto accident so i leaned forward to see where the accident was at on the freeway. i was in a hurry to get home and did not want to get stuck in traffic. i was commuting regularly back and forth between los angeles and riverside. all of sudden a large blue\\white object came across the horizon at a high rate of speed. there was no other colored lights visible; just the solid blue\\white light. it was oval\\saucer shaped and very bright. it moved from north to south disappearing behind a line of trees lining the freeway. i would estimate it was no more than 500 ft. high in the air and i observed it at a distance of 500 ft to less than 1 mile. i then realized why other people ahead of me on the freeway started to brake and slow down. they saw the object before me and were reacting to it. i immediately thought this was my first ufo encounter and couldn't believe i had witnessed such a strange event. it was a very surreal experience. i also had a follow up event approximately 2 week later while traveling from los angeles to riverside on the same freeways in the same general area. when i complete this report, i will file my second encounter. these events occurred 22 years ago and i still think about both today."],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-117.427758","Date Submitted":"10/31/2011 01:02 UTC","Latitude":"34.099964","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.099964,+-117.427758(32981)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32981) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/15/1989 06:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10312011-0004","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Fontana","There were no other sightings in Fontana on or around September 15th 1989"],"City":"Fontana","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Viewed large blue/white object while traveling west on hwy 60 or 10","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Region":"California","Case Number":"32981","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32981.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32981.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20"}
