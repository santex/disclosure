{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 6:45 p.m. CDT time I obsevered two triangle shaped UFO's over my house in Kenner, Louisiana. (New Orleans area) The first one was at a low altitude and moved from west to east slowly. It had multi colored lights and was a black color triangle UFO. The lights were set on the triangular areas so you could see it's shape well! It moved slowly over my house and made no sound. Right after this another triangle shaped ufo appeared in the sky above my house. This one was at a much higher altitude and at that time I was able to get my HD camcorder but the UFO was at to high of an altitude to capture good video footage. I felt a feeling of great knowledge while witnessing the triangle UFO up close! Wonderful experience!"],"Summary":"Triangle shaped UFO up close over the New Orleans area!","Log Number":"US-12202012-0023","Date of the Event":"12/20/2012 06:45 UTC","Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"12/20/2012 10:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Kenner","There were no other sightings in Kenner on or around December 20th 2012"],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44690.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44690.html"],"Region":"Louisiana","City":"Kenner","Latitude":"30.023378","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-90.234758","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.023378,+-90.234758(44690)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44690) map </A>","Case Number":"44690","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
