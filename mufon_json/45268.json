I noticed this fireball type object slowly moving across the nearly clear sky at a steady speed. I used my iPhone to snap a couple of pics then a few seconds of video. I thought it was a jet completely engulfed in flames but it continued on its path with no noise or change in altitude or direction. No contrail or streak following it."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"A slow - medium moving fireball like object with no tail (contrail). No speed or altitude change.
