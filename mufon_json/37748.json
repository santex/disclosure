We were past Statesboro heading towards Waynesboro in US 25 North. Head of us we saw 3 lights (above the tree line) ALL IN THE STRAIGHT ROW up in the night sky. They were bright yellow and glowing. It appeared like a jet coming into a landing. One light, then 2 lights and 3 lights. All lining up in a row. There are NO airports out here. Cotton fields and dark. Then one light shot off, 2nd cirlced around and took off and the 3rd one disappeared. I laughed and told my son I bet those were UFO's. We came home and searched internet and noticed others have seen \"weird lights\" in the same location."],"Longitude":"-81.947882","Date Submitted":"04/25/2012 11:44 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Millen","There were no other sightings in Millen on or around April 25th 2012"],"Country":"United States"}
