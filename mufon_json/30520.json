{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Shape":"Fireball","Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting DetailsWorking security at Laguna Beach, CA., new housing development, midnight, very dark. My co-worker and I saw a bright light in the sky moving from west to east. The light stopped right above our heads. It was glowing orange flames. I was sure that it was a rocket from Vandenberg AFB just up the coast. The object sat in the night sky for about a minute before disappearing. My co-worker and I both agreed that the object seemed to \"go up\" in to space. One minute later, two flashing red lights flying in formation appeared and stopped in the sky at the same location where the object ascended. Seconds later we heard a loud chopping sound coming down the California coastline. We both ran toward the beach and saw a big black military helicopter with one flashing red light flying low down the coastline. Our cell phones and walkie talkie radios started ringing with everyone wanting to know what's going on. My bosses made a big deal out of the incident. They even checked with Vandenberg AFB. Nothing was ever resolved."],"Region":"California","Case Number":"30520","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-08072011-0083","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.546598,+-117.78085(30520)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30520) map </A>","Longitude":"-117.78085","Date of the Event":"08/04/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.546598","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Laguna Beach","There were no other sightings in Laguna Beach on or around August 4th 2010"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30520.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30520.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/07/2011 04:52 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Bright light moved slowly across the sky.
