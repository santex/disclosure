I told him probably flares or an airplane flying low. But as we went outside he spotted the lights just across the street had an orange yellow glow about it. It hovered in the area for about 10 minutes and the light's disappeared. 5 minutes later the lights appear again this time lower than before. The lights would dim in and out randomly before totally disappearing completely. During this event me and the neighbors kid tried our best to get as close to the area where the object was. We listened for sound (was none) as excited & stunned to see this event my immediate thought was call local police and see about how they can look in to the event. I was told by dispatch to report it to a UFO website. And I did. After the object was no longer visible I contacted MUFON Arizona for the report."],"Latitude":"32.832489"}
