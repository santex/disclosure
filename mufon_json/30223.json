It was a neon green color and it came from the sky down to the earth. It was really weird and set my nerves on edge. My friend who was coming out onto the patio said he saw it out of the corner of his eye. He explained it as a lighting bolt. The sky was clear and the sun was not up as of yet. It was gone as fast as it appeared. I am not normally up this early but was having my coffee before we had to leave to take my friend to the air port."],"Date Submitted":"08/07/2011 09:31 UTC","Latitude":"42.238832","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08072011-0108","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-75.984435","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"green streak in sky"}
