{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside having a family bbq and I looked up towards the east and could see a triangular looking craft with 3 bright lights, it seemed to be not moving at all. We could see it rotating slightly every few minutes. Im not very good at measuring something from a distance but I could tell this thing was quite large. My video camera batter was dead I had my son go try to get a charge real quick on it, and I called up my mother to tell her to look outside to see if she could see it and by that time I looked up and it was gone, I never even saw it move or leave the sky, that really made me and my kids a little frightened"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27649.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27649.html"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Spokane","There were no other sightings in Spokane on or around February 4th 2011"],"Summary":"Triangular object with 3 lights","Longitude":"-117.416107","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02042011-0010","Case Number":"27649","Date Submitted":"02/04/2011 02:01 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.66349,+-117.416107(27649)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27649) map </A>","Latitude":"47.66349","City":"Spokane","Region":"Washington","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/04/2011 06:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown"}
