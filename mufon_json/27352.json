I had bought heavy rugs from the Pier 1 store and the sales person was going to meet us at the back door to make loading my car easier. While driving behind the mall to get to Pier 1 back loading door, my sister and I, without any doubt, saw a bright star like object flying West-we were looking South. Plainfield Indiana is somewhat close to the Indianapolis In���t Airport, so anything flying to the West would not be unusual. Because it was familiar, the very bright white star-like shape caught my attention. We pulled into the Logan���s Restaurant parking lot to get a better view, the time was 8:22pm The moving \"star-like object\" came to a complete stop and then moved the opposite direction- left (East) in an swooping movement- and then it moved right again (West)-It then stopped and remained stationary for a time. A second smaller \"star\" followed shortly after at 8:42pm. By 8:49 it was putting on a show for us. Side to side, climbing up, and then down for as long as we would watch -it had a \"floating\", \"effortless\" feel when observing it. I have set criteria for myself in trying to be accurate in determining that what I am seeing is not a planet, or truly a star etc. The very obvious and unusual back and forth, up and down movement from the two ���star like��� objects certainly fulfilled my rule. I had been to the same area,the same time, on Nov. 8th, 2010(T.J.Maxx Store parking lot- I was facing South), I again noticed a bright white star object. The star object follow me in mu car from one end of a parking lot across the street (changing directions from looking at it in the South- East, to after it moved, I had to view it by looking West). I literally saw it make \"snake-like\" movements from one location to another (details to follow in reports)-Needless to say I was terrified. I would assume my sister and I have had more \"sightings\" and experiences lately than the average person. Experiences that have been witnessed by my husband who is a medical doctor, my 16 yr.old son, two of my nieces, and two of my close friends who are educated researchers. I will be grateful for Mufon���s expertise to help me gain insight on what is currently happening to my family."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.705542,+-86.392999(27352)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27352) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.705542","Date Submitted":"01/11/2011 01:52 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27352.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27352.html"],"Summary":"1-8-11 Saw two star-like objects in Plainfield Indiana.","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Plainfield","Disposition":"IFO"}
