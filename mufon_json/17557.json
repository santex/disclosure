(unless the government was testing a flying object back-engineered from ufos or created with some secret innovation being kept from other american engineers and the u.s. department of transportation, and they'd forgotten to turn their lights on until they had flown about 200 miles)."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.659514,+-82.318336(17557)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17557) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/03/2009 09:15 UTC","Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two bright, white, erratically flashing lights, seemingly belonging to one structure, jumping around in sky.
