I noticed that there was a yellow star among the other white stars. I kept staring at it, all of a sudden it moved slowly to the right. Then is sat there for a couple minutes, then moved up. This kept happening, it would go to the right more, then stop, down, stop, left stop. I didnt know if it was a satellite, it was just amazing. I just watched it from my deck for a about 20 minutes. It was not a plane, as it would keep changing directions, in a small space of the air. And it didnt move at certain times, once it sat for about 10 minutes in one spot, other times it would move every couple seconds. Unbelievable. After about 20 minutes, it seemed to get small dots around it, or change to a flat star instead of round and then faded out. I didnt know what to do after that. I wished I had some one there to see it with me. I am hoping that someone else saw a similar thing."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"8508","Log Number":"US-11302007-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.587586,+-72.599534(8508)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8508) map </A>","Latitude":"42.587586","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Greenfield","There were no other sightings in Greenfield on or around November 29th 2007"],"Weather Factors":"None"}
