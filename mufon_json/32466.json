I saw 2 orange glowing lights in the sky. They were probably 500 ft in the air. They were obviously not any sort of known aircraft, so I pulled over. One of the lights quickly decended down and then went back upwards. They both traveled to the north at a very fast pace and were soon out of visual sight."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32466.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32466.html"],"Longitude":"-83.824244","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/08/2011 09:30 UTC","Case Number":"32466","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Swartz Creek","There were no other sightings in Swartz Creek on or around October 8th 2011"],"Latitude":"42.966601","Summary":"2 Orange glowing lights that hovered around and then sped off","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","City":"Swartz Creek","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/08/2011 10:00 UTC"}
