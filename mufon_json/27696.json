{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI feel silly about this but....Was driving home from work between 8-8:30. My attention was caught by a very bright light to my left. On closer inspections I could make out 3 centers in the light that blended to form an oval shape. It seemed to be very high and for the distance seemed huge, way bigger than any plane lights could be and the wrong color. Thought it must be a plane on fire. Then it began to descend fairly quickly and I thought that the plane was going to try to get to the Doylestown airport. But then it abruptly shot straight up and began a kind of zig-zag pattern of movement. Then, the creepiest part....in a millisecond it was gone. I didn't even blink. Sat for 5 more minutes waiting, but that was it. What the heck was that???"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-75.084183","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Furlong","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Furlong","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02062011-0005","Case Number":"27696","Date Submitted":"02/06/2011 11:30 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.296928,+-75.084183(27696)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27696) map </A>","Tags":"City","Summary":"3 very bright, large yellowish lights that blended into oval shape, erratic movement, abrupt disappearance","Date of the Event":"01/19/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27696.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27696.html"],"Latitude":"40.296928"}
