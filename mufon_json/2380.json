{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI am relating this event for my father who died some years ago..It occured whilein flight training in florida in the mid 1950s..On a sunny day 7 jets, with 2pilots each, were in flight training off the florida coast..They apparentlynoticed being tailed by an orange ball..The squad attempted some evasivemanuvers. and then decided at some point, to try and converge on the ball. Hesaid it really was useless, that they could never get close, The ball changedflight path, direction and speed, at will, and after toying with the planes,shot off..After landing, there was a debriefing, within a day or two, there wassome type of meeting with the pilots invoved basically ordering them not tospeak of the incident, and that it had never happened..Im sure some of thoseother pilots are still alive..unfortunately my father died years ago but spokeof the event..He later was an officer in SAC, flew quite a few classifedmissions, and would never have made the story up. thanks, tom waltz"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"have to check","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2380.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2380.html"],"Summary":"related from my father, air force offer chased UF","Date Submitted":"11/30/1954 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/30/1954 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.670097,+-81.506154(2380)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2380) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-81.506154","Latitude":"27.670097","Case Number":"2380","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been no other sightings in have to check","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
