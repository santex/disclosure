They simply like being photographed in the vicinity of the religious objects. They must be telling us something. These photos are also the recent ones. I have many more and more text but I am not in a mood to spend so much time sending it all. And this guy was doing some crazy stuff in the sky, flying through the flocks of birds which did not pay attention. To them that all seemed completely normal. The speed was enormous and the persons was starting it from a single place (from a hover). I did not photograph that. There was not enough light (I mean ��� I did photograph but all what you can see is a black hill). I need a better camera.
