At first I thought it was some kind of RC toy. I quickly dismissed that, as it was clearly a metal sphere and was further away than I first thought.I could tell that it had no lights but instead was reflecting the sun randomly. It slowly ascended and made a right turn and moved just in front of a lone cloud where it hovered. I attempted to take some video with my cell phone. While it was hovering stationary in front of the cloud it appeared as a solid black circle. It disappeared into the cloud. I have seen this exact same type object before recently and also have cell video of that."],"Case Number":"42322","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42322.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42322.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Ocala","There were no other sightings in Ocala on or around September 5th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-09052012-0018","Summary":"Metal Sphere ascending and Hovering in Broad daylight.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-82.034272"}
