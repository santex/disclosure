{"Latitude":"32.225546","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my bedroom watching television when my mom thought she heard a gunshot, so I went out the back door to investigate. I didn't hear anything, but a flashing light in the sky caught my glimpse. At first I thought it was a plane because it was flashing and the light appeared to change colors. It was approximately the same size as a big star, but it flashed red, blue, and white. It pulsated and changed color. It did not change position, it just pulsated. I ran inside to grab my glasses, as I thought I was imagining this or just not seeing well. It was still there and I continued to watch for approximately ten minutes. I went back in the house because I got cold, but it was still just hanging there flashing. It appeared from my vantage point to be south east of town."],"Date of the Event":"11/03/2008 12:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13487","City":"Stephenville","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-11032008-0002","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13487.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13487.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/03/2008 12:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.225546,+-98.192743(13487)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13487) map </A>","Country":"United States","Summary":"blinking light that stayed stationary in the sky","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were no other sightings in Stephenville on or around November 3rd 2008"],"Longitude":"-98.192743"}
