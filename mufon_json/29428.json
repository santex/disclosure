{"Latitude":"30.315427","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn May 28, 2011, at 9:30 p.m. I went outside to turn off the water hose that I had soaking my magnolia tree. I notice 5 very bright yellow circles with a smaller red circle of lights on the outside floating over my head. They were traveling South to North very slow and there was no sound. Soon 3 or 4 more circles came over, then several more, etc. I watched for 20 mins. and counted 15 total. They were not in a formation and were not bouncing all over the sky. They seem to stay on the South to North path. I called the Lone Star Airport around 10 p.m. to report what I had seen and asked if they had seen anything in the sky, but no one there had seen anything. Since then I've learned that a neighbor had seen the same thing around the same time but had counted more circles. They must have started watching before I came outside."],"Summary":"For 20 minutes I watched 15 yellow circles fly over my house","Object Shape":"Circle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29428.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29428.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/06/2011 09:13 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/28/2011 09:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.447991","City":"Conroe","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-06062011-0008","Case Number":"29428","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Conroe","There were no other sightings in Conroe on or around May 28th 2011"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.315427,+-95.447991(29428)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29428) map </A>"}
