The UFO flew down some way before dropping a glowing object and then leaving as fast as it arrived, i tried to video it on my phone but it had appeared to have stopped working, i was able to turn my phone on after the UFO left. I searched for the object that the UFO dropped but all i found was an empty field. When i first saw the oject i thought it was a comet but its movements and the lack of parts breaking off it made me think twice. My first thoughts were \"cool a comet\" but then i figured it was a UFO so then i thought \"cool a UFO\" but after it left and i had some time to think about it, it scares me."],"City":"Beerwah","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date Submitted":"07/30/2007 03:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7547.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7547.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Queensland","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball, Oval","Date of the Event":"07/30/2007 03:10 UTC"}
