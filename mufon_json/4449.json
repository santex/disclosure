{"Log Number":"US-02182006-0006","divs":["sighting detailsi was in the house, watching tv alone at night, late. i got a mental message to go outside and look at something. i thought that was weird, but after a few minutes, i went out. i was leaning against our barn, looking across a field. there's a spooky woods over there. i was looking across a corn field. this is a rural setting; no immediate neighbors. i was wondering why i was standing there, looking, but kept at it. suddenly, a purple object appeared about 1\\2 mile away. it was beautifully purple, amethyst, lovely in color. the first object looked like a left eye shape, pointed on the inside. it seemed to pulse with energy, some huge energy, something out of this world in power. i knew it was 'looking' at me, showing itself off, showing me it was there. as i watched it, it stayed where it was, pulsing. then the other side of the eyes appeared, the right side appeared just like the first one did. now i could see two purple eye shaped things, as big as ships, 'looking' at me. it stayed that way, pulsing with superhuman strength, for about two minutes. then the side that appeared second slowly diseappeared as it had appeared, followed by the first shape. they had trouble controlling the huge amount of power they had inside, or so it seemed. i could tell they had the energy to travel through universes. i saw into another dimension for some strange reason. this appearance has been haunting me ever since. this house is out in the middle of nowhere and very old, seeming to be haunted. i used to be very sure there wasn't anything to fear here, but now i'm not so sure. i want to see this again and can feel something out of this world in the atmosphere. i can't wait for the weather to warm up so i can look at that spot every night. hopefully, i'll see it again. thanks for reading this. joan williamson"],"Country":"United States","Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Saw two purple objects in sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4449.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4449.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lyons Falls","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-75.367122","Date Submitted":"08/29/2005 11:30 UTC","Latitude":"43.625347","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.625347,+-75.367122(4449)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4449) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"4449","Date of the Event":"08/29/2005 11:30 UTC","City":"Lyons Falls","Object Shape":"Teardrop"}
