turning in for the night. my purpose was to observe the stars and look for orbiting satellites and meteors. it was a cloudless, clear night. visibility was unlimited. there was some background light from the town of grand blanc, mi and floodlights associated with the buick open festivities beamed about the sky. stars, the moon, and normal air traffic were clearly visible. shortly after i began sky gazing, i observed one meteor make a short streak in the sky directly above my location. the meteor was traveling from west to east. at approximately 10:50 pm. i observed what initially appeared to be another meteor traveling from west to east along a latitude well north of grand blanc, mi. i observed the first streak of light from the apparent meteor and expected not to see another streak due to the meteor having burned up in the atmosphere or skipped back into space. shortly after the light from the meteor abruptly extinguished, a streak appeared again along the same heading as the first streak and appeared to be roughly the same length. my subsequent thought was that the meteor had made two skips in the atmosphere and had burned out after he second skip. when i saw a third streak of light similar to the first two along the same course as the first two i initiated a count (one-one thousand, two-one thousand) and determined that the subsequent streaks of light appeared at approximately two second intervals and had durations of approximately one-half second each. after the fourth or fifth skip, the apparent meteor made a rapid course change from west to east to south\\southwest to north\\northeast. the course change was made while the apparent meteor was in contact with the atmosphere as the streak traced out a curve from the previous course to the new course. the meteor then appeared to skip two more times along its new north\\northeast heading before its view was blocked by trees in the line of sight of the object. the meteor appeared to maintain steady course and speed along its two headings. the duration of this first observation was approximately 30 to 45 seconds. excited about the behavior of the apparent meteor, hereafter referred to as the object, i immediately went inside of my house to tell my wife and one of my sons (the other was out with friends) about the object i had just observed. my wife had been asleep on the couch and i woke her up to tell her about the object. i also called down to my son who was in the basement either watching tv or on the pc or internet to tell him about the object. both my wife and my son expressed interest in what i had observed, made a couple of joking remarks, and chose to remain in the house after i asked them to come out with me to watch the sky in the event the object was in orbit and could come back again. i expected to see the object in approximately 90 minutes traveling from sse to nne if it was an orbiting object and if its course did not change again. i went back outside to continue sky gazing and to wait for the object to fly by again in 90 or so minutes. i placed a call on my cellphone at 11:07 pm (the call is logged on my cellphone) to my parents' in virginia to tell them, particularly my father who also is a regular sky gazer, about the object i had just observed and its behavior. my father was asleep on the patio according to my mother so i told her not to wake him. i told my mother about the object i had just observed and its behavior, and explained to her that i was going to watch for another 90 minutes or so to see if the object was going to fly by my location again. shortly after the call began, i observed what seemed to be another object traveling from west to east with the apparent light lengths, intensity, durations, altitude, and skipping intervals as the first object i had observed. the object was traveling along a latitude that was farther south of the first object's latitude and passed almost directly over my position. the object made approximately four skips and made a rapid course change from it's east to west heading to a sse to nne heading. the course change was madewhile the object was in contact with the atmosphere as the streak traced out a curve from the previous course to the new course just like the first object i had observed earlier. the object skipped a couple more times and was observable until its view from my position was blocked by trees along the travel and line of sight of the object. excited that i observed the same type of object within approximately 20 minutes of the first object traveling in the same direction and making a similar course change as the first object, i continued to excitedly tell my mother over the cellphone about the second object and at the same time hurried into my home to tell my wife and son about the object and get them to come outside with me to look for more objects. my wife stated that she was too sleepy and did not want to go outside to look for more objects. i called down to my son in the basement and persuaded him to come outside to look for the same or other object and to witness any subsequent object with me as i didn't think anyone would believe that i observed these objects alone. my son and i went outside to watch the sky in the event the same objects or other similar objects fly by or over again. we watched the entire sky but expected subsequent objects to be traveling from west to east at anytime between 20 minutes and 90 minutes. within approximately 15 minutes of going outdoors to watch for the same or similar apparently orbital objects, i was facing west when i observed what appeared to be a similar object traveling from north to south at an azimuth angle just above a line of trees near our position. the object appeared to exhibit similar light lengths, intensity, durations, altitude, and skipping intervals as the first and second objects i had observed. i observed the third object for approximately 15 seconds. upon sighting the third objected, i immediately alerted my son to its position and line of travel by pointing and telling him loudly where to look. my son picked up the object visually and watched it with me until the object made a rapid course change from north to south to nne to sse and immediately disappeared from both our sights behind the trees west of our position. my son acknowledged that he did see the third object although he saw it for a shorter duration (approximately 10 seconds) than i did. my son and i waited outside for a while longer to wait to observe any subsequent object or objects similar to the prior objects that might fly by or over our position. my son went back inside the house after 15 minutes or waiting. i continued to speak with my mother by cellphone and watch for similar orbiting \\ skipping objects. after many more minutes, i did not observe any other orbital \\ skipping objects similar to the prior three objects, nor did i observe any other objects, to include meteors, other than the stars, the moon, the festive flood lights roaming the sky, and normal air traffic. i concluded sky gazing and my cellphone call with my mother at approximately 12:15 am on august 1, 2009. i went back into my home to speak to my wife and son about what my son and i had observed. i went to bed at 12:22 am on august 1, 2009. i am reporting the object or objects i and my son observed on july 31, 2009 as a ufo or ufos as neither i nor my son were able to identify what the object or objects were based on our visual observations and our knowledge and previous observations of flying and orbital objects such as aircraft, meteors, comets, satellites, and manned spacecraft. i am hopeful that as we sighted these objects on three separate occasions on a cloudless and clear night, that others who might have seen the same objects that same night have filed or will file a report of their observations of the objects as well."],"Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-08052009-0001","Latitude":"43.021777","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Sighting
