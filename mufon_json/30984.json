{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/18/2011 11:07 UTC","divs":["Sighting Details On August 18th 2011 at approximately 0434 am hours while on duty at my job, I gased up at the clear sky and observed a star like white obect that flewed from east to west with no sound at approximately comercial jet altitude. what it made me wonder if it was man made, is the fact that it was zigzaging while flying a path then as soon as it reached a 45degree angle on the east side of the sky, it acended and disapeared. I been a good portion of my life in the military and law enforcement and nothing on our U.S. arsenal could zigzag while flying the way this object performed. I am sure someone else had to see it too."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08182011-0013","Case Number":"30984","Latitude":"25.507529","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30984.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30984.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"08/18/2011 04:34 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Summary":"Star like object zigzag path west heading east with no sound at 0434 hrs.","City":"Homestead","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.507529,+-80.461388(30984)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30984) map </A>","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Homestead","There were no other sightings in Homestead on or around August 18th 2011"],"Longitude":"-80.461388","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States"}
