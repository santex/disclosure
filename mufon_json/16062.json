{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Details March 12th, 2009 I spotted 3 star like objects, starting at 8:09pm. It was like a star moving across the sky. The color was amber to orange. I seen it coming from the north. It was moving slowly south then it stopped. It remained hovering there until about 8:40pm? It was fairly high up. Then I saw it taking off near where it had hovered, it was dimly lit while hovering. It lit up and looked like a star as it was moving north, where it disappeared from view. The 2rd one I spotted, again looking like a star as it was moving from the south and it was low and west of me. It stopped and I lost where it was because of the trees in the backyard. I didn���t see it fly away. The 3th one I seen it coming from the east and after it got to about 12:00 over me it curved NW. It went that direction and way down on the horizon where it appeared to come done considerably in altitude. Then speed up and stopped. Then headed back my way again on an angle upwards and stops. Then it went back NW to about where it had stopped before. Then stopped and descended and I thought it was going to land, but it stopped. It then rose up back up, Then stopped and moved south a little then move north and stopped. It then descended again a little and rose back up a little and stopped. Then started south and made a ���U��� turn as it turned up very sharply at about 135 degree up and northward. It climbed up fairly high (4,000ft ???). It then leveled off and flew north where it was soon out of sight. I lost it to the north. This was probably about 9:15pm. I came in at about 9:30pm."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/12/2009 08:09 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"16062","Log Number":"US-03172009-0002","Summary":"Round objects, amber to orange in color, silent.","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Utah","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16062.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.699253,+-111.99586(16062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16062) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Longitude":"-111.99586","Latitude":"40.699253","City":"West Valley City","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in West Valley City","There were 3 other sightings in West Valley City on or around March 12th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"03/12/2009 08:09 UTC"}
