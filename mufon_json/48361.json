{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my back yard sky watching as I do every night. I often see things that could be satellites or ufo's. but this time it was much closer or larger and brighter than any I have ever seen. Brighter than aircraft landing lights that are usually in the area. when it got over me straight up I observed it with my binoculars to be sure it was not a plane. It was a bright blue-ish white slightly pulsating. As it moved it seemed to be on a jittery path, changing speed and direction kind of like a jitterbug on the water. After it passed overhead and was far to the southeast it quickly turned red-orange and got smaller and dimmer until it was out of sight. At that time the full moon was low and a bit to the north and blocked by the house next door so it did not interfere with my observation. As the object was overhead I felt energy, a kind of excitement not usually felt during my other nightly observations."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/22/2012 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.988848,+-115.108788(48361)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48361) map </A>","Summary":"Bright star like object went directly overhead then changed to orange-red and shot off disappearing in the SE sky.","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Log Number":"US-06232013-0024","Longitude":"-115.108788","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Henderson","There were no other sightings in Henderson on or around June 22nd 2012"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/23/2013 03:28 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48361.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48361.html"],"Region":"Nevada","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Henderson","Latitude":"35.988848","Case Number":"48361"}
