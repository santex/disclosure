(but, if true, why would they be brightly illuminated?) when i mentioned this to *(name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms), he said he'd heard of that, but that it was likely the u.s.\\mexico border that was patrolled. i'm totally unaware of the distance of these lights from myself; being night time, of course, it could have been 5 miles or 50 miles away. anything like this ever crossed your desk? thanks in advance."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
