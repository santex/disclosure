We were driving to my husbands step grandparents house about 5 miles from his moms house. The road is a two lane that is surrounded on either side by tall pine trees, you can see straight down the road. So straight ahead of us in the clearing of the sky, we saw this bright big light BLINK on out of nowhere a little above the treeline. It stayed still for a second, then went across the clearing over to the other side of trees, then stopped. THEN LOWERED STRAIGHT DOWN INTO the darkness of the trees. it was just after sunset so the skies weren't completely black. My husband and I both agreed you could see a dark circular outline around the light..lets just say it was the most disturbing ufo I've seen. And Im glad I dont live there anymore."],"Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10271.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10271.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10271.html"],"Longitude":"-86.128662","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Log Number":"US-04112008-0016","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Other","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"10271","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Freeport","There were no other sightings in Freeport on or around December 25th 2007"],"Date Submitted":"12/25/2007 05:30 UTC"}
