At first I thought it was a pretty large star because there were many stars in the background and then grabbed my DSLR with a 300mm lens. That's when I was able to clearly see the multi- colored flashing lights and the object which was hovering. It did not look like a plane, blimp or helicopter. The lights were multicolored and were not flashing in any particular sequence. Took took approximately 8-10 photos but only one seems to show something similar to how it actually looked when I was looking into the camera. The rest of the photos came out with a light blur in the background."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43798.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43798_submitter_file1__IMAG0009.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43798.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"11/08/2012 09:45 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.936557,+-80.12762(43798)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43798) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Sunny Isles Beach","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
