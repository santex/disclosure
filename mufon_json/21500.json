We went route 95 which takes you past the Jefferson Memorial. WE were on a bridge crawling in traffic. Stop and go. My daughter who was 9 at the time says, look at that plane up there. I looked and I didn't see a plane, I was in Navy at the time and I worked on aircraft. About 2 o'clock I saw a very large, silver, cigar shaped flying object, moving very slow. It was moving from my right ot the left. I watched the object, it was above a hill which was right in front of us. It didn't move fast, nice staedy speed. It moved above the hill till it got right in front of us. It stopped for a few seconds, then shot straight up in the air and was gone. I said wow! I mean anybody that looked up saw it. The bridge was packed with cars."],"Date of the Event":"10/16/1989 03:30 UTC","Longitude":"-77.031046","City":"Washington","Latitude":"38.904712","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
