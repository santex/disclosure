{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDaily Democrat-Letters to the Editor I had a sighting in June 1981 from the back yard of my home. I was enlisted in the Air Force for 4 years. I retire last year, after 19 years of civilian service. I have worked on or have seen in flight, just about everything. I worked in the software and electronic engineering field assisting engineers with design and testing. It was early afternoon and clear with no wind. I was in the back yard and heard a very low frequency hum. Looking north, I saw a 4 foot high shiny metallic sphere that would pass directly overhead. I thought that a weather balloon was about to crash in my back yard. I moved 15 feet westward, while watching the very slow moving sphere. I noticed no loss in altitude. It would pass 5 feet over my home, but headed directly at the TV antenna mast. I looked for anything flying in the sky. I thought, ���There goes the antenna.��� Observing from the front and side that it was a complete sphere, but I had no idea how it could fly. It was moving so slow. Approaching the back part of the house, it stopped for a split second, but continued the very low frequency hum. Then, I saw the sphere move straight up, slowly. I thought, ���This is a genuine Unidentified Flying Object.��� My first thought, ���It is a omnidirection receiving probe.��� Similar to an ocean probe observing sea life. I was in awe of this engineering masterpiece. I was scanning my memories to explain that straight up maneuver. I had no answers. The sphere moved straight up, until 5 feet above the antenna. It stopped for a split second and moved south. Over the front yard, it stopped for a split second and moved straight down. 10 feet above the house it stopped for a split second, then continued south. Seeing this craft���s engineering drawings and manuals would be an overwhelming event. I ran to the front west side. It came to the power lines and made the same 90 degree maneuvers. Up, over, down, about to tree level, continuing south. It was flying an exact southern path. I thought of driving to follow the sphere, but could not predict a west or east change in direction. It was hard to follow as it disappeared into the trees. I went back to the patio and sat down. I had been a nature study for aliens somewhere in space. A time warp opening and closing at 10 year intervals or alien research funds only available every 10 years. I can hardly wait for 2011."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Woodland","There were no other sightings in Woodland on or around May 31st 1981","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"38.678516","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10919.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10919_submitter_file3__GarySandy4.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10919.html"],"City":"Woodland","Case Number":"10919","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05252008-0016","Summary":"4 foot sphere going to TV mast.
