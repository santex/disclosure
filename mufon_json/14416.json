The five of us witnessed this event. We all took pictures and videos with our cell phone cameras. The objects darted about the sky for about an hour. The objects made movements unlike airplanes or helicopters or balloons or flares. There was no noise. None of us had ever seen anything like this before. The same two objects were also seen, at the same time, by my family members living 20 miles to the west. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR THE OBJECTS VANISHED INSTANTLY. i DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET MY VIDEO OF THESE OBJECTS IN THE FILE BOX BELOW. cONTACT ME AND i CAN EMAIL IT TO YOU AT mufon.
