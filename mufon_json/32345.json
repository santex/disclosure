As i watched the object i noticed the light turn slowly white. I thought the transition from red to white looked out of the ordinary so I moved to the side of the road. The light seemed larger then normal aircraft lights and as it rotated from red to white there was no break in the light as it rotated. The rotation took about 3 seconds to get back to solid red and was a steady pattern like this the whole time it was in sight. After a few seconds i noticed the object was moving in a slow southern direction. I had been watching the light about minute when i realized i was in the way of traffic so i drove off and tried to keep the light in sight as long as possible but by the time i got to a place to pull over i lost sight of it."],"Log Number":"US-10042011-0019","City":"Commerce","Date Submitted":"10/04/2011 06:57 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"solid red and white lights that appeared to be rotating","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.598223,+-83.484212(32345)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32345) map </A>","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/03/2011 08:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.484212"}
