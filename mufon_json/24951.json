It moved in short distances from left to right and stopped breifly just to change colors. It seemed either very small or very big and a long way up. It looked like a star but it also looked like it could have been a bullet or diamond shape but I can't tell due to the distance. I seen it at exactly 3:38 am but it may have been there longger.
