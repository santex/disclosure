First sighting was to the mid left of my windshield, object illuminated taking about 2 seconds to reach full illumination. Object stayed lit for about 5 seconds then the lights took about 2 seconds to black out. Roughly 15 seconds later the object appeared to the mid right of my windshield again taking 2 seconds to reach full illumination for about 5 seconds followed by 2 seconds to black out. The third and final time between 5 and 10 seconds later the object appeared dead center of the two previous spots and took roughly 2 seconds to fully illuminate however this time I was able to see what looked like 8 or more light sources on the body of this object. The object appeared to be almost rectangular and completely stationary."],"City":"Fernley","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
