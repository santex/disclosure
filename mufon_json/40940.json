There were only a couple other people on the course at the time. I looked to the sky above the treeline on the far edge of the course at a bright red light that caught my eye. I knew right away it wasnt a plane or anything else I had ever seen before. The surface of the object appeared to be some type of red reflective foil. It moved slowly but steadily in a straight line overhead, completely silent. We lost sight of it when it dissappeared behind the trees. I would estimate it was at least 500 feet overhead and from my perspective about the size of a pea. My friend and I are usually pretty skeptical, but what we saw was the strangest thing either of us have ever seen."],"Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.876743","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
