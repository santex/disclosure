{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was looking towards the East( towards Aurora, NC) and noticed what I thought was a star blinking. I kept an eye on it and it suddenly shot straight up in the sky then to the left and then to the right(would hover between movements) It continued this for quite a while(maybe 30 minutes) I saw a plane coming into it's air space and the object dropped. When the plane was out of sight it shot back up into the place I first saw it. I went into the house for 10 minutes and came back outside and it had moved way to the left. I could not tell the distance because it was to far away. My husband said he saw the same thing a few hours earlier on his way home from his band practice. The object was still in sight when I went in the house at 12:15am"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/15/2012 01:12 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.512663","Longitude":"-77.100509","Log Number":"US-08152012-0004","Region":"North Carolina","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Chocowinity","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.512663,+-77.100509(41761)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41761) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/14/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41761.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41761.html"],"City":"Chocowinity","Case Number":"41761","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Summary":"hovering and zig zag movement","Source":"MUFON"}
