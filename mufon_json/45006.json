I was sitting in my car when i noticed a weird looking light up in the sky at northwest moving southeast. The light was amber in color. the light seem to flew at a very low altitude and my first thought was it might be some kind of firework. as i got out of my car for a better view i noticed a black triangle shape object behind the weird light. Since it was cloudy i could not see anything above the strange object. Whats even weirder was that the flying object did not make a single sound. I know it was flying very close by but there was no sound. I lost sight of the light and object as it flew directly above me because it was very cloudy at that time."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"The shape was triangle and it has a front light that was amber in color.
