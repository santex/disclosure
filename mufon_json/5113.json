{"divs":["sighting details*i have included a video clip of the event. it's not very good i know. i had a little trouble with the zoom on a new camera but there are a few quick shots of the object. it is hard to see it in the video, maybe with some software it can be zoomed in on or cleaned up. i did increase the brightness since the sun had set the video was a little dark. i do have the original still on the tape. several family members and i were sitting on the front porch talking when i noticed the object coming over the trees. at first i thought it was a jet and it looked about that size at first and typically like what you would see as a jet is approaching (when i say jet i mean like an f14 or that type) at an air show altitude. but as i studied it i noticed it had no fuselage and it was moving quite slow... probably a little smaller than a jet would be at that altitude. after watching for a minute or two i said out loud \"what is that?\" at that point the others jumped up and we all went out to the front lawn to get a better look. i was not the only one that was trying to figure out what this thing was. it didn't act like any object i have ever seen. as we continued to watch i asked my wife to run in and get my camera. originally she thought it was a balloon, but as the object got closer it did not rotate or act like a balloon would. i would not expect a balloon to stay pointed in the direction it was going and it would have been a very large balloon and triangular? it stayed straight on with the tip of the triangle shape pointed in the direction it was traveling like this \\\\. i might also add that it appeared to have something on the left and right side that appeared round in shape. i couldn't tell what they were but they were located about midway down what would be the wing or side of the object and sticking out just enough to notice. that's the best i can do on discription. anyway the object traveled at what appeared to be the same speed but was climbing. it started out traveling directly toward us in a southwest direction and then turned west over the trees and along the treeline, which is also a creek and bike trail. it then faded back into a southwest direction and out of sight behind trees. by the time it was out of our site i estimate it had reached a low cloud altitude. object summary: object was black or dark and triangular in shape with small round feature midway back on both sides. it appeared that the round features might have been on the top of each of the triangles sides, maybe spherical and was just visible from our prospective underneath but i'm not sure. moved slowly, but faster than something like a balloon. did not rotate once, stayed pointed in the direction of travel, moving in a southwestern direction then fading west and then south western again. i remember thinking that it was strange that it was coming right at us and when i started filming it went around us... but again i don't know if it actually did that or it just appeared that way. front of the object seamed to be a bit raised... like a plane would when landing. was climbing the whole time we watched it until out of site at a low cloud level. that's about it! i'm wondering if anyone else saw anything? and what did we all saw that day. we certainly don't know!"],"Longitude":"-81.43175","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Stow","There was one other sighting in Stow on or around July 15th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Black or Dark Triangle/no sound/no lights, moving slow at dusk","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"41.16889","Date of the Event":"07/15/2006 09:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"5113","City":"Stow","Date Submitted":"07/15/2006 09:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.16889,+-81.43175(5113)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5113) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5113.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5113.html"],"Log Number":"US-07192006-0007"}
