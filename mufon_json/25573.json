Milton, Fla. Scattered cloud cover. Rained earlier in evening. Temperature in 70s. Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church, after an evening of playing music with church member musicians. Leaving the church, the object was brought to my attention by a member of the band. Intense white strip of light below clouds, estimated altitude to be 15,000 feet, appeared to be the length of a commercial aircraft. The elongated bright white light traveled from east to west at the speed of a commercial aircraft. It moved erratically left, right and obliquely forward in estimated two hundred foot jumps.My first thought was, 'This is really weird.' The object reminded me of an insect, but thinking on it later, I believe the (legs)spears of light from the object was just light refraction. Observed by four persons and myself, I observed it for about four minutes, then had to leave. No aircraft in area. Object was totally silent."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.641395,+-87.033848(25573)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25573) map </A>","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Latitude":"30.641395","Region":"Florida"}
