They were over our mountains. Then they came on again several miles to the right. This time they were not in a row..two of the lights were together the other above and to the left. Over the course of an hour we further saw single lights come on and go out quickly in different parts of the sky. Since, we were outside we heard no engine sounds. My husband is a former Navy Jet pilot. He could not identify what they were. We did not see them move at all. There were no running lights visible which is in violation of the FAA if it were a conventional aircraft. Has anyone from Las Cruces mentioned these sightings ?"],"Longitude":"-106.857437","City":"Las Cruces","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.289544,+-106.857437(21385)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21385) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/06/2010 07:00 UTC","Region":"New Mexico","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21385.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21385.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/07/2010 01:09 UTC","Summary":"lights"}
