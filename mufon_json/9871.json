We were traveling down Interstate 90 going west. I was on the passenger side of the vehicle laid back reading a book. I looked to my right and saw a strange dark object in the clouds. My first thought was \"That's a strange dark spot in the clouds.\" I ignored it and went back to reading. I saw a streak out of the corner of my eye. I looked to see what it was and saw a new cloud in front of me with the same dark spot. This time I took a picture. Since then, I have been having some weird occurances happening lately. I am fully awake in my bed, but cannot move. A dark silhouette figure with a pear shaped head walks up to the side of the bed I am laying on. He touches my forehead. The whole time, I can see the alarm clock. When the silhouette touches my forehead, I come out of the frozen state but two hours have passed."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"07/03/2007 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Longitude":"-110.358936","Object Shape":"Oval, Other"}
