I was over in HONOLULU, HAWAII in Feb with my wife We went out for Lunch and sat outdoors. There were clouds were out that day, other wise it was a nice day out,So i was taking pictures all that day. I was going through the pictures today and I noticed a small black object in the upper right hand side. I enlarged the picture the best I could do, and I don't know what it is,it looks like a eye to me It's not a plane or a helicopter. ( I drew a black circle around it ) So what is it? Look forward for your answer. Regards Patrick Conley San Diego, CA"]}
