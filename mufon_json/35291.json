I was with my family in my apartment, located in the colony \"Letran Valle\" in Mexico City. We were just to breakfast, when looking out the window, I saw far away a series of some objects that at first seemed like metallic balloons. After looking at them for some time, we note that they were not actually balloons like. They were at a distance of about 5 to 6 kilometers south-west direction, at the height of the horizon (approximate) . The group of objects climbed slowly, one followed by another one (we count around 75 of them) to reach a high altitude (about 50 degrees from my place, maybe around 40 to 60 Km to the ground), and slowly they began to move northward. Hard to tell if they emitted some kind of light or just reflected sunlight (which was very intense) because they looked very small from our perspective, and it was, sometimes, easy to lose them in the blue sky. We took some pictures with cell phones, but it not work at all (they were too high), so I took my old Canon Rebel XT semi-pro digital camera (8 mega-pixels) and I took around 10 pictures without knowing if it really will work (because i can't see anything from the camera vision), it was very difficult to focus, given its small size and high altitude. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to the group of objects to cross the sky, until they passed over our building (four floors), and we were not able to see them anymore. By capturing the photographs in the computer,I happily discover the objects on the pictures with some help of the digital zoom, but sadly I did not take any clear object to work like reference to the objects... PD: Also, my lens was very dirty :P -------------------------------------- En espa���ol: Era una ma���ana soleada, al rededor de las 9:00 A.M., no hab���a nubes y la temperatura era de unos 10���C. Estaba con mi familia en mi departamento, ubicado en la colonia Letran Valle, en la ciudad de M���xico. Estabamos por desayunar, cuando al mirar por la ventana (frente a la mesa), observ���, bast���nte lejos, una serie de objetos que en un primer momento parec���an globos metalicos. Luego de mirarlos con mayor atenci���n, nosotros notamos que no aprec���an ser globos. Se encontraban a una distancia de unos 5 a 6 km, en direcci���n al suroeste, a la altura del horizonte. Ascendieron lentamente, unos seguidos de otros (contamos al rededor de 75 objetos) hasta alcanzar una gran altitud (a unos 50��� desde mi perpectiva), y lentamente comenzaron a avanzar hacia el norte. Es dificil saber si emit���an una luz propia o reflejaban la luz del sol (que era muy intensa) y se ve���an basnate peque���os desde nuestra perscetiva; tanto que en ocasiones era f���cil perderlos de vista. Tomamos algunas fotograf���as con celulares, pero no se lograban distinguir, as��� que tom��� una c���mara digital Canon Rebel XT (8 Megapixeles) y tom��� varias fotograf���as sin saber si en realidad aparecer���asn los objetos en ellas, pues era muy dificil enfocarlos, dado su peque���o tama���o y su gran altitud. Tardaron unos 10 a 15 minutos en cruzar el cielo, hasta que pasaron sobre nuestro edificio (de cuatro pisos), y no los pudimos ver m���s. Al capturar las fotograf���as a la computadora, felizmente observ��� que s��� se lograban ver los objetos al hacer zoom digital; pero que tristemente no integr��� muchos objetos como referencia... PD: MI lente estaba bastante sucio :P"],"Summary":"Group of approximately 75 UFO shiny or metallic appearance; up to a certain height and go to the north in formation.","Region":"Distrito Federal","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35291.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35291_submitter_file1__IMG_7218.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35291_submitter_file2__IMG_7219.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35291_submitter_file3__IMG_7220.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35291.html"],"Country":"Mexico","Log Number":"MX-01272012-0007","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"01/27/2012 09:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Mexico City","There were no other sightings in Mexico City on or around January 27th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
