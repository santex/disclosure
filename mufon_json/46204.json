I just happened to look up and there was a big round bright blue light moving in the sky N.E. above the mountains. Only reason I look that way is that I have seen this before. This light moves with intent and glows bright and can move up and down, then switch direction quickly. It stopped and paused like it was observing something. The only eason I think this is it glows with almost and aura when this happens. This happens a lot in that area. Then it purposely disappears."],"Latitude":"44.074892","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.074892,+-114.738391(46204)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46204) map </A>","trends":[],"Region":"Idaho","Date Submitted":"03/14/2013 08:27 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"bright luminous round hovering object moving back and forth. alson stopped and took it about 15 seconds moved up a small motion then back towards us.
