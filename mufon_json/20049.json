As i neared the airport I was able to see two sources of light, one being the airport beacon and another brighter source a bit further past the airport. I pulled to a stop alongside the road adjacent to the light, having observed it to be eminating from a saucer shaped craft approximately 150-200 feet in diameter. there were bright lights along its outer perimeter and on top and underneath. the lights were different colors, greens, reds, blues. the craft was just above the trees and was only approximately 100 yards from where i stood alongside the road. I ovserved the craft for about a minute after getting out of my vehicle. I heard another car approaching on the road and turned my head to see if they were going to pull over. when I looked back the craft had disappeared. I was not frightened, I was curious."],"Longitude":"-76.042371","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"craft hovering above trees, no sound, many bright lights, then disappeard"}
