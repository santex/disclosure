{"Case Number":"11090","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/08/2008 10:28 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were outside smoking a cigarette when I first noticed a shooting star. Then I moved around the car to look at the Big Dipper, when a white light appeared from the West,(Facing Beach Street) then seemed to float light a balloon, then it bounced up and around and my husband kept saying that it was a bird or something. It went left then right then sped off towards the left(east), towards Belknap Street and then vanished. While we stood there in amazement, I searched the sky to see if there was another one there. To my astonishment, I turned to look at the big dipper again and noticed a small bright star and then it began to move. I watched it move from the West to the North, it was about an arms lenghth of space. If I had to guess how far away the first one was, I would say below 10,000 feet, the second one was higher than 30,000 ft because I also saw an airplane below the \"star\" I saw. The second object was visible for about 35 seconds. My husband said that he doesn't even believe what he just saw and I was a bit excited about it.-Fort"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11090.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11090.html"],"City":"Fort Worth","Date Submitted":"06/08/2008 10:28 UTC","Latitude":"32.727969","Summary":"Two Sightings in one night..White Light dancing then vanished Fort Worth","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were 2 other sightings in Fort Worth on or around June 8th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.31535","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06082008-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.727969,+-97.31535(11090)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11090) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
