{"Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"22575","Region":"New Mexico","Summary":"Sphere morphed into triangle over W. Albuquerque/Rio Rancho.","divs":["sighting details(this happed at 12:15am on 3\\31\\10 - your form doesn't seem to want to accept the time i inserted). ever since my sighting last summer, i scan the sky whenever possible looking for more, so..... went outside to let my dog do his thing before retiring to bed and saw what at first appeared to be a star low on the horizon wsw of me over the rio rancho area of w. albuquerque which is west of road \"528\" where the suburb density drops wanes off into desert. this star was very bright and no other stars were in the vicinity (it's a full moon), and even though it didn't have faa flashing lights, i still figured it was an oncoming plane's lights or something and didn't pay particular attention to it. about 2-3 minutes later, i looked again and noticed that the \"plane\" not only hadn't moved at all, but the bright white light had now changed to red, so i ran inside to get my binoculars (7x50). through the binoculars, i saw what appeared to be a large \"v\" shape hanging in the air pulsing red-green-red-green. rt 528 is about 15 miles from me as the crow flies and at first this thing appeared huge, but in the 15 minutes i watched it, it leveled out - still pulsing red-green until it drifted west to the point where i could no longer see it with the naked eye, but could still see it with the binoculars, and then in a few minutes it got so far away it was gone. anybody traveling south on 528, which goes n\\s, must have seen this thing as it's size was considerable, so i'm hoping for a corresponding report."],"Log Number":"US-03312010-0004","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[],"Date of the Event":"03/31/2010 11:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.97687,+-105.030454(22575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22575) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/31/2010 03:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-105.030454","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.97687","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22575.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:14:00","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
