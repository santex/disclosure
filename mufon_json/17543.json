I opened the sun roof and noticed a small dot moving across the sky, then another and finally a third. I got out of the car and watched these lights for the next 20 minutes. They appeared to be very high up. When the lights banked or turned it was very sharp, acceleration and hovering were not something that you would see from a airplane or helicopter, there were no beacons or flashing lights. I am an avowed skeptic, but I have always wanted to see something like this. Ultimately we just lost track of the lights. I was with a classmate of mine named Troy and he saw them too,when my son came out, he saw them as well so it was nice to have witnesses. None of us could tell for sure what we were seeing."],"Longitude":"-112.068537","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.452047,+-112.068537(17543)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17543) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/18/2009 12:00 UTC"}
