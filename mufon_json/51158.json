As we were about to get into my truck we both noticed at the same time a bright silver orb that seemed to have a distorted field all around it hovering over San Francisco Bay. During our observation ( approx 40 min.)we both seemed to be locked in focus. The object was spinning fast, directly next to Hunters Point Power Station. It seemed that the object was taking power from the Power Plant. The distortion and the inability to remember I had a new top end camera around my head and was unable to use it. Somehow the sphere took hold of our will. The next thing I remembered was that we had left the city and were in Santa Clara when we pulled over and said at the same time \" did you see what I saw\". I can't reason why I couldn't take one picture? Has anyone out there seen something like this?
