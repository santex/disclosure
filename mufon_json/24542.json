It was still very light outside, but some neighbors behind us had started shooting fireworks. We saw a strange red glowing light on the tree covered hill in the distance. At first I thought it was some sort of firework. Then I thought maybe it was tail lights from a car going up the hill slowly. It kept rising past the trees, and then flew in our direction. I then thought maybe it was a helicopter, but realized that it couldn't have taken off in the middle of the trees like that. It was a steady glowing red light. It made no sound at all. As it got closer and was flying over the neighbors yard I could see the outline of a black or dark gray saucer shape. The glowing red light was on the bottom of it. My son ran to get my husband, and we followed it to the front yard and watched it fly off in the distance. We were able to watch it fly for about one to two miles before we lost sight of it."],"Latitude":"37.836456","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-07152010-0018","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.836456,+-86.065522(24542)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24542) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Kentucky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24542.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24542.html"],"Case Number":"24542","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 09:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Flaherty","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Rose straight up off the top of the hill slowly and flew over the neighboring yard.","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","City":"Flaherty","Tags":"City"}
