Was standing there, noticed nothing, no sounds, nothing. Looked up and saw these 3 lights in a triangle. Two ride and a green. Watch for a few minutes did and the thing just sat there. Took out his cell and took a picture. He did not tell anyone except his wife. Today, he we were having a family dinner and he pulled out the phone and said look at this. We all looked at the picture and thought what the heck. I had him send it to my email address so I could make the picture bigger. When you make the picture bigger, it actually looks like 4 circular with a dozen light. The son in law is really not into UFO's so he did not do anything more that just take the picture and forget about it. It resembles a lot of the pictures I have seen on the TV shows."],"City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"45880","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45880.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02242013-0029","Summary":"3 bright lights in a triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"02/10/2013 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/24/2013 09:07 UTC","Longitude":"-93.092552","trends":[],"Region":"Iowa","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
