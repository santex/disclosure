Looked up and a enormous three pillars thing that had interconnecting tunnels between the pillars. It was not vertical or horizontal some where in between. Was gray blackish in color. Looked down at the road to pull over, Then looked back up and it vibrated and was gone. It was big and looked some distance away. no windows or doors could be seen. Feelings were it did not happen, but I know it did. I thought that there is no way some one could support a thing like this and or construct it in a rural area."]}
