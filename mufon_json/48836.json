I noticed something in the sky moving, thought it was geese at first. As I continued to watch I realized the object had a shape to it, and what i thought, for a split second, were geese flying in formation, were actually dim circular lights on the underbelly of a boomerang shaped object . I watched the object fly in a straight line for about 5 seconds, then it completely disappeared. Thought I was crazy for a little bit, but I couldn't deny what I saw. I didn't tell my friends at first, because I didn't think they'd take me seriously. Decided to report what I saw when I read an article about someone who had seen exactly what I did."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48836.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/09/2013 08:19 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.811522","Object Features":"Other"}
