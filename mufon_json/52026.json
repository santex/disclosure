About halfway down the block, I noticed a bright light in the sky to my left, and said something like 'Hey, there���s an airplane.' My friend looked, and pointing out the orange color, said that he didn't think it was an airplane. He pulled out his phone to take a picture, the light was rather small at this point, but quite bright. I followed his lead, and used my phone to record the light. In the video it only showed up in a short blip a couple of times. The light was moving in an arc to the south and as it traveled, it grew in size. The intensity of the light seemed to disperse over the surface area, becoming more dim, and also seemed to undulate, bringing to mind a jellyfish, or plastic bag tumbling slowly on a breeze, though the shape of it stayed constantly spherical. Both my friend and I were rather in awe at this point, and I again tried to film the object, which did not show up in my camera. We thought nearby streetlights might be interfering, so moved down the block a little bit to the west, toward the object. My phone camera still would not recognize it. It was slightly smaller than a dime at this point, and stayed this brightness, shape, and size from the peak of it���s height in the sky until it disappeared behind the buildings at the end of the block across the street to the south. We ran to the end of the block to try and see it again, but it was no longer visible. Some of our friends were on the corner, but hadn���t noticed anything in the sky. It seemed to keep a constant speed during the two minutes or so that we observed it. It also seemed to rise and descend, thought that could have been an illusion due to our point of observation. The most impressive thing about it was the undulating quality of it���s surface, and the fairly swift, but smooth transference to that state from a bright concentrated point of light."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52026.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52026.html"],"City":"Salt Lake City","Log Number":"US-11042013-0008","Longitude":"-111.885387","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"52026","Date of the Event":"11/03/2013 08:59 UTC"}
