I thought a plane or helicopter can not change directions that quick, so I proceeded to watch and then a smaller object appeared coming toward the larger one and they met and kept going. The larger one was gray and shaped like a submarine. It would stop in mid air for a second then move forward and change again. It turned and flew slowly over my house then back to circling around they area. I watched it until it disappeared in mid air."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
