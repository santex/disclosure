the object was moving upwards and to the north but very very slowly.at times it had a purple halo around it like a black light.after watching it for about 20 or 30 minuutes with her she then noticed a second object that was pulsating! this one was gold, smaller but also star like shaped (like an christmas tree topper with many points).it also made the same movements as the other one. at about 9pm i decided to call it a night and went home.this am about 5:30 i went back out to our drivways end to see if they were still there but it was overcast. i could see an occasional star peeking thru the clouds ,then i noticed a tiny light moving over head towrds the north. i pointed my flash light at it and bam it lit up like jupiter for about 10 secs then disappeared or cloaked,it was under the cloud cover when traveling north. tonight we will go back armed with camera and tripod to see if the objects will still be here.last feb we had something similar to this that stayed here for 2 weeks, every night same time same place.my husband thought maybe it was some kind of fixed satelite or station but i think they are not stationary.anyway this will be our familys 5th report with mufon in 2 yrs. we have had other interesting sightings that have not been reported but told to our mufon invevstigator **(name deleted--cms\\sg) has visited our ranch out side austin and witnesed with us unussual activities in our clar clean night sky.my friend ***(name deleted--cms\\sg) who i met on the mufon chat board call where i live ufo alley..... photo one..notice the orbs...the bright one is the object...the 3 rd object u may need to zoom 200% we have more photos if interested..i hope i picked the best ones sorry for this long report and not so great writting skills:)"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.915327,+-97.139132(26573)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26573) map </A>","City":"Flatonia","Case Number":"26573","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
