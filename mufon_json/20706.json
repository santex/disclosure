{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI left work at 12am as I work 4pm till 12am, I work in Union ville which is approx 15 mins from port Jervis were I live, the quickest route is to take the Minisink turnpike then to the Greenville turnpike, I was driving on the Minisink turnpike when I noticed lights in the sky, firstly I thought it was a plane then I noticed it had 5 lights on it from end to end the lights went from blue-white-red-white-blue in that order but the strangest thing was it was turning clockwise slowly and the only sound I could hear was like a cat purring, I slowed the car down to around 20 mph to get a better look then I noticed the size it must of been around 200 feet in length, I proceeded to speed up as I started to get nervous but as it passed over the car the car turned off I came to a stop and grabbed my cell phone and noticed that had turned off too, by this time I didn't know weather to get out of the car and run or stay in my car before I came to the decision the lights had gone out and the car started up I put my foot down a sped up the road not looking back I tell you it was the most unnerving things to happen to me."],"Log Number":"US-11252009-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20706.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20706.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.381444,+-74.686903(20706)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20706) map </A>","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/25/2009 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"20706","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"The object was approx 200 feet in length and there was 5 lights on it blue, white, red, white, blue.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.381444","Longitude":"-74.686903","Date Submitted":"11/25/2009 01:37 UTC","Region":"New York","City":"Port Jervis","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Port Jervis","There were no other sightings in Port Jervis on or around November 25th 2009"]}
