Dull metallic gray angular chevron object with transparent canopy. No lights. 300+ feet length. 200+ feet altitude. Visible only with polarized lenses.","divs":["sighting detailsobject was observed while seated in parked vehicle in large, private business parking lot facing east looking out windshield during bright, cloudless afternoon conditions. driver's side door was slightly open as it was warm. witness was wearing polarized sunglasses and observed object traveling into field of vision from north to south (left to right) for at least 20 seconds about 200 feet altitude or slightly above a four story building. attention was drawn to object due to its immense size (spanned over 300 feet) and low altitude. speed appeared to be similar as commercial aircraft as observed in high cruising altitudes and no noise was detected. color was light gunmetal gray metallic and had dull magnesium-like coating appearing fluid-like or liquid, changing shades of light gray or having a cloud-like haze surrounding it. witness was talking on cell phone to relative at the time object appeared in line of sight and reported sighting to her. out of fear and disbelief, witness remained on phone as long as observation took place, describing series of events. when object was directly in front of line of sight, angular, multi-wing shape was observed most clearly with well-defined, transparent, glassy, dome-shaped canopy on top toward front, very round, like a soap bubble. canopy seemed large for the overall size of the object, occupying approximately one-tenth of object's size and was about double in height as compared to the width of the object. width of object appeared to be similar to commercial jet (727 is 34 feet) and was about one-tenth the length of the total object. shape of object was a five or six-pointed star\\chevron\\hexagon and construction was slightly faceted (not smooth) in appearance. although object did not have a smooth surface, it reminded witness of a stingray animal as it was flat with ample surface area, had larger angular wing-like structures in center, and smaller angular tail-like wings pointing from rear. there were no smooth curves visible except for canopy. shape was difficult to determine due to object being parallel to line of sight and object could have been morphing. surface appeared to be constructed from multiple portions of metal sheeting as seams and ribs were evident but no rivets were visible. no lights, mirror-like appearance or shininess were observed. overall appearance was of a fluid-like dull metallic which witness had never seen before and has difficulty describing. when first observed, thought object was military craft (usaf b2-spirit-shaped, except did not have as thin of nose and had a very visible canopy) until removed sunglasses (high quality non-prescription polycarobonate custom-crafted at optical shop) to attempt better view and object seemed to disappear as if cloaked. faint, whitish outline could still be seen without polarized lenses. replaced sunglasses and object reappeared with remarkable detail as originally observed. witness removed and replaced sunglasses quickly in succession at least three times when first observing object and then removed and replaced glasses again toward end of sighting. toward end of sighting, witness became startled when commercial jet was observed in 45+ degree angle of ascent (taking off from nearby airport) and approached flight path of unknown object as it appeared there would be a mid-air collision. jet flew less than 20 feet above object, crossing over perpendicular (from east to west) to object's path and witness was able to calculate size of object as at least three times the length of the average-sized commercial jet's wingspan. jet was on high angle take-off and was traveling slightly faster than observed unknown object. object never deviated from path and remained constant in altitude. witness exited vehicle after losing sight of object to the south, most likely due to pollution haze, and walked inside building. witness reported sighting to co-workers and later in the week to security personnel assigned to the building."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Chevron, Star-like","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Dome, Patterned Surface, Appendage(s), Wings","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona"}
