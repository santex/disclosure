I was facing north with my head resting toward the sky, almost straight up. Visibility was unlimited with no clouds, light winds from the west and about 90������F. It was a very quiet day with very little air traffic. As I was looking at the clear blue sky I saw a tiny white dot almost overhead about the size of a dull pencil tip at arms length. I looked at it for a bit more and grabbed a pair of binoculars I had nearby, it appeared to be \"metallic\" white in color, oval to round in shape with a dark coloration toward the bottom of the object. It was traveling northeast toward Pasadena-Arcadia in between my location and the San Gabriel Mountains. It was moving slowly so I ran inside to get my camera. When I returned I was able to take 1 photo of the object at about a 95-80������ angle before the roof of the house blocked it from view. I took about 10 min to track about 4 hand widths of sky."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.118499,+-118.209951(43021)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43021) map </A>","Latitude":"34.118499","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"{dr}Facing north, observed bright white circular object about 85 degrees overhead heading slowly toward NE.","City":"Los Angeles","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around September 30th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
