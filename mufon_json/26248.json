As you walked you had to look down because there were spaces about a foot wide between each pallet. I was having a hard time see when suddenly i could see individual bricks. Then the bricks were lit up clear as day. I looked up as fast as i could to see a round blue light wizz over my head about a thousand feet up. Some of the people in the tent even came out because the light was so bright. I just heard about MUFON and figured i report this anyway. theres about ten of us that saw this light and a thought someone else may have seen it and this would add to additional reports. if i ever see anything else, i will certainly report it immediatly."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
