I was not the first to see this event. I was sitting inside and my mother called out the family. She was smokeing and she sees 4 lights that are all flashing at the same time and that are about 10 degrees apart. These all moved at the same rate (about 10 degrees per second with one flash every second) We followed the lights from north west to south west. They suddenly stoped over the tree line and then stayed in place for a good minute. They then suddenly dropped out of sight behind tree line. About ten seconds after we got outside (15 seconds elapsed time from first sight to four members outside) we heard the roaring start. The roar continued for about 10 seconds after the objects sppeared. Aproximit elapsed time 3 minutes. All members saw same thing."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Tawas City","There were 4 other sightings in Tawas City on or around May 9th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38044.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38044.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Tawas City","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/09/2012 10:27 UTC","Log Number":"US-05092012-0025","Country":"United States"}
