I am familiar with aircraft the noise they make , their lights and flight patterns. This craft flew across the airport silently ,it was a black chevron shape craft. The lights were pulsing , not strobing. It threw a orange cone -vortex shaped light on the ground . Then a red on the trees, then white before it flew across the airport into my neighborhood. This did not come from Andover airport , we only have had about 6 night flights in since June 09. I have seen and filmed lots of other crafts recently , within the past few weeks crafts that drop white orbs. Hovering crafts and orbs that skim or fly by .
