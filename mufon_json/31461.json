Very close to my house, we suddenly saw an orange-red orb hovering fairly high in the sky. We stopped at the nearest stop sign to watch it. It moved around in a general, clear path, but it made small oscillating motions. My daughter saw a thin, fuzzy black line going through the circular, red-orange center; I did not see this. We attempted to take a video on my daughter's cell phone but the light was so far away that it did not show up on the viewfiender. The object continued to move further away until it disappeared (disintigrated) into the clear night sky. There were no sounds heard. It was definitely not a plane nor a helicopter. We drove around for a while searching for it, but it was simply gone."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/02/2011 10:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.468902","Country":"United States"}
