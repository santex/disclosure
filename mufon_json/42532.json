I was doing my late night checking of the grounds. I saw a large black triangular craft flying low (just above the pine trees) a few hundred feet away. I was not alarmed. I believed at the time that it was merely a stealth bomber from the nearby Seymour Johnson Air Force base. I observed it for a little while, curious, but with no thought that the craft was otherworldly. I found it strange that the craft had no lights or structural features. It also was moving incredibly slowly without a sound of any kind. At the time I ignorantly thought to myself, \"Well, it's gotta be one of those stealth bombers they just unveiled for the Gulf War.\" Only many years later, watching various UFO documentaries did I realize that all man-made aircraft do make noise and that others had seen the strange, silent, black triangle."],"Log Number":"US-09132012-0014","Case Number":"42532","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"09/13/2012 02:16 UTC","City":"Kinston","Country":"United States","Summary":"Black triangle sighted flying low and slow; looked like a stealth bomber but made no noise.","Longitude":"-77.579225"}
