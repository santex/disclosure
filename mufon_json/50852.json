{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWitnessed what seemed to be something on fire in the sky which was surrounded by 3 smaller bright amber lights. All lights were solid. The center glow stopped shortly after witnessing and the small amber lights started rotating slowly around a point in the sky. Each light followed the same exact path. No sound was audible. Could not see any shape. Not sure what type of helicopter has no blinking lights and just a solitary amber light."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-09162013-0007","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"40.865861","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.865861,+-73.198619(50852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50852) map </A>","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Smithtown","There were no other sightings in Smithtown on or around August 31st 2013"],"Case Number":"50852","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/16/2013 10:51 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/31/2013 09:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50852.html"],"City":"Smithtown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Unknown","Summary":"Glowing amber light surrounded by 3 smaller amber lights","Longitude":"-73.198619"}
