She noticed the object first. It was hovering over the city. It appeared much higher than the rest of the buildings and skyscrapers. It was large and looked like it was far away. It pulsated many colors quickly. I tried to take photos of the object but it did not show up. I think this is because it was pulsating so quickly. It was round and not well defined. The edges were blurry. It was hard to keep track of the colors because of the fast pulsating. I believe it was blue, yellow and red. It was hovering in the same spot for over an hour. We went back and forth from inside to the balcony several times throughout the hour to look at it."],"Country":"Canada","Latitude":"43.239391","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Ontario","Date Submitted":"09/18/2011 03:48 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/17/2011 11:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31884.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31884.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.239391,+-79.887444(31884)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31884) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Circular shaped, hovering and pulsating lights on the Ufo","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle"}
