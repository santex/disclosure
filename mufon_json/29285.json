It was still quite dark out. I was traveling south on Hwy 95 in Bullhead City Arizona. A light amber colored orb caught my eye to the east. It was moving quite slow in a east north east trajectory. It continued over the Black Mountains range until it was out of sight. I called my wife and told her about the event and asked if she would go outside and look to the west to see if she would be able to see the object from her position which is in Golden Valley hoping to see it appear on the other side of the mountains from her position. She was unable to spot the object."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-05282011-0007","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Bullhead City","Summary":"Hwy 95, Colorado River Valley","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
