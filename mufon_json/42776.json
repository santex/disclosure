They were both emitting red and orange lights occasionally changing intensity and after watching for about thirty seconds the faded out completely. Looked for them for another hour and they didn't reappear. Their location was approximately 15 miles away and would have put them over the Long Island sound northeast of Port Jefferson. Their size would be enormous because they were quite large as other aircraft flying behind them of known size indicated that they would be about at least 300 feet across. Their estimated altitude, again, using existing aircraft in vicinity would be approximately 2000 feet and 1500 feet. We observed another UFO in our neighborhood last year on the 31, August 2011. This observation was directly over our neighborhood at the same time in the evening."],"Summary":"Saw two stationary objects glowing orange/red for 30 seconds and then faded out.","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.911038,+-73.039(42776)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42776) map </A>","City":"Mt Sinai","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
