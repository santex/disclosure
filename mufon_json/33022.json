As it came over head it looked semi transparent. It had no noticable wings and was tubular in shape. These type of craft come through this area quite often. However this one was rather large. It was about 30 to 40 feet in length with a dark band in the center and on one end. I didn't know what to make of it. Just thought folks would be interested in seeing this and maybe someone else has seen this before."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"33022","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10312011-0043","Longitude":"-94.471553","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.004352","Summary":"Tubular Ufo Just above tree line.","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/31/2011 10:57 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Raytown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Raytown","There were no other sightings in Raytown on or around October 31st 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
