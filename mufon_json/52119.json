{"Date of the Event":"11/08/2013 07:30 UTC","City":"Hope Mills","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/08/2013 10:36 UTC","Latitude":"34.976642","Object Features":"None","divs":["sighting detailsme, my wife, and 2 yr old son were leavin my aunts house in the southern area of hope mills, nc. my wife (driving) first noticed 1 bigger orangish light hovering at least 300 ft or more above ground level, which looked fairly large and was kind of dull in color, i first thought of a meteor because of color and size, then i noticed it was not moving. that's when the object seemed to either multiply or deploy a smaller brighter orb as the big light simotaniously disappeared from my sight. as the the orb started to move and descend alone i noticed an orange trail very similar to a meteors fire tail, almost identical, but was moving or falling to slow to be one. then as it was falling (in a path similar to a leaf or side to side pattern) we both watched a second orb literally appear out of nowhere, stunned at this point we were both in awe at the orbs movement and color\\fire trail of these orbs when the third one popped up a few seconds after the second we were shocked and i was honestley a little scared and worried as these 3 objects gradually descended to the tree line one by one in different patterns, i turned my phones camera on by this time just to notice that the camera really didnt help, we could see the 3 orbs moving and falling behind the tree line on the video but it doesn't show the brightness or orange\\fire like trail behind them as they fall behind the tree line. we drove the the area for a while, not seeing anything except the smaller plane circling a large area around us. after the 30 minute ride home, that same plane with the same lights was still in the same airspace a mile or so up, a lot higher than then the 100-150 feet it was flying when it flew right in front of us as the orbs were falling. i still can't explain what we saw tonight, but i just hope someone else saw what we did. that was actually our second time seeing orange orbs together, we saw 30+ large orange orbs hovering very low directly over a neighborhood in raeford, nc in 2005, as we passed the lights we lost sight behind trees, made 2 u-turns to drive by again but were not there the second time, about 3 minutes later. twice me and my wife have saw orange orbs and cannot explain any of it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52119.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52119.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hope Mills","There were no other sightings in Hope Mills on or around November 8th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.976642,+-78.938536(52119)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52119) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11082013-0018","Case Number":"52119","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Region":"North Carolina","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"3 orange lights with trails of flames.","Longitude":"-78.938536","Tags":"City"}
