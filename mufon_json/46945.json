{"Summary":"Visiting family in US from the UK","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhen sat outside the house I saw multiple white starlike objects come in from a northernly direction, they were differing ranges of brightness and followed a path towards the south, travelling to the same spot in the sky until they dimmed and disappeared. one of them came in from a north east direction and then suddenly changed direction to line up on a path to the south and then dissappearing in the same location as the others. two of the objects crossed the sky paralell in the sky but opposite directions and disspeared at the same time a few seconds after they had crossed paths. After seeing the first object I felt a shiver in my spine and the hairs on my arms stand on end however I think that this is due to the fact that I had never knowingly seen any objects before and it was both a surprise and excitement. this feeling soon went and after seeing the 7th object I was left feeling excited and very happy to have seen them."],"Date Submitted":"04/23/2013 11:03 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.670445,+-81.339632(46945)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46945) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04232013-0023","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-81.339632","Region":"North Carolina","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.670445","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Hickory","There were no other sightings in Hickory on or around April 23rd 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46945.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46945.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/23/2013 09:45 UTC","Case Number":"46945","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Hickory","Tags":"City"}
