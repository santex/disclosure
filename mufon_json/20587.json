I was a child then, about 6 or 7 years old at the time, I was in the living room when at about 8:20 pm my parents and I noticed some commotion out in the street. We ran out side and I saw all the neighbors on the street pointing up at the night sky towards the end of the cul-de-sac, about 700 feet away. I look up and see very clearly, an huge craft with rows of lights blinking in sequence, white, blue, some green. It wasn���t very high above the houses, probably about the height of a 15 story building. The craft was probably about 500 hundred meters wide may be more! I coudn't believe my eyes, this gigantic machine was just floating in the air shining it's lights, I waited for my fahter to say something like \"oh that's just a blimp with lights\" or something like it but he just stood there with his mouth open. It was a big craft hovering, no sound, and everyone who was out on the street could see it. This wasn���t some bright light in the sky moving behind trees, this was something you could see very clearly, no clouds in between it and us, very close and you could see the fuselage or metal that it was made of because of the reflection of it���s flashing lights on it. The craft wasn't completely flat, it's shape was part concave and part convex, as when you take a piece of paper hold it infront of you and pull the top part towards your face, this curvature is what reflected light illuminating the craft's body. It had a wide row of lights aroun it's outer edge or diameter and then a shorter row of lights above that and another set of lights below the wider row. some other lights blinked very fast others slower. Yes, it was that close that all of us could actually see it's structure, so it wasn't just some set of lights hanging on some wires or some balloon or blimp flying by. I remember very clearly because at the time I had no preconception of what ufo���s were so I looked at it with a clean slate, not thinking it was ���this or that��� , I just observed and took in every little detail. We stood there for a about ten or 15 minutes and some people where saying that this thing had been there for a while now. My parents grabbed me and ran back into our home in fear. They closed all the windows and kept asking each other ���what is that?��� I���ve never seen my parents as scared as they were that night. you could feel the fear or anxiety of everyone who was witnessing the event. After witnessing this event, which must have been seen by thousands that night, I don't know what all the fuss is about the Phoenix lights. It's a pitty that in the 70's camcorders weren't available like they are today because this UFO I saw that night would have been the most undeniable proof of intelligent life visiting earth because of how close it was to the ground, how clearly you could see it's fuselage and all the lights in it, and how it looked like something with mass and not just some massless row of bright lights blinking on an off."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20587.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20587.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/22/1972 08:32 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Gigantic disc with dome, flashing lights white, blue, green.","Country":"Puerto Rico","Case Number":"20587","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.377596,+-66.158037(20587)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20587) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"PR-11182009-0015","Latitude":"18.377596","Date Submitted":"11/18/2009 02:51 UTC","Region":""}
