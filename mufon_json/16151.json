This is not the first time i see what i would normally associate with a satellite just to watch it do things satellites are not supposed to do.Most of the time they seem to be coming from over the Gatineau,Quebec mountains to the north of Ottawa just a couple miles away.I did not take photo's for phone cams are terrible (well mine is anyway) so i don't bother anymore."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.257275,+-85.318914(16151)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16151) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:33"}
