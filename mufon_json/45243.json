We went out into the yard to get a better look and then there were more. It would start as a bright light and then seperate off one another. They were bright lights and at one point looked as though they were getting closer and closer but then would just disappear. There were about 4-6 each time but never landed just disappeared. They would just appear as if out of the clouds. We have never seen anything like this before and are just baffled by it.
