Noticed triangular shaped craft hovering above a nearby street intersection. When it changed position, instantly above another intersection, I observed that there were several other craft that were all 'instatly' exchanging hovering type positions above various street intersections. I, of course questioned what I had observed, until I noticed that there were several other people in vehicles, that had pulled off onto the shoulder of the freeway to observe the craft, just as I had done."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
