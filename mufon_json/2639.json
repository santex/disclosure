I saw anintensely bright light, that appeared to be up on the mountain. As we gotcloser, I realized that it was not on the mountain, but above it. WE initiallythought that it was an airplane, but ruled that out after it did not move. Wewere curious and slightly nervous after we realized it was nothing we had everseen before nor anything that we could accurately say that it was. The objectappeared to be disc shaped, the bright lights, upon closer looking, were chasingone another , moving consecutively, white, red, so on and so forth. The lightswere bright enough going around it, that you could faintly see that it wasprobably silver or gray and that there was a dome shape on top.The dome shape was subtlely lit up with a green-ish light. It only hovered andwe lost site of it as I turned down the street going to my house, which then putthe object behind us rather than to the left side of us as before. I pulled myvehicle over,looked out my side window and could no longer see it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2639.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2639.html"],"Latitude":"36.118676","Country":"United States","City":"Las Vegas","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-115.163586","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.118676,+-115.163586(2639)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2639) map </A>"}
