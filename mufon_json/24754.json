FALL ON THE NORTHEASTERN HORIZON. IT WAS A FLASH OF WHITE-ORANGE LIGHT LASTING JUST A FEW SECONDS. THE METEOR SHOWER CALLED ``THE DELTA AQUARIDS`` PEAK ON JULY 29. I BELIEVE IT M-A-Y HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM..IT FELL NORTHWEST OF SOUTHEAST INDY. BUT IF THIS INFO DOES N-O-T CHECK OUT, IT WAS A UFO. ALSO, THERE WERE 2 HELICOPTERS FLYING NEARBY. THAT IS TYPICAL FOR THIS AREA AND TIME OF NIGHT. THE SKIES WERE CLEAR AND THE FULL MOON WAS COMING UP ON THE SOUTHEAST HORIZON; THE HORIZON O-P-P-O-S-I-T-E TO THE METEOR WHICH FELL NEAR THE NORTHEAST HORIZON. NOW, SHOULD ANYONE ACTUALLY ``RECOVER`` THIS METEORITE, I WOULD LIKE A CHUNK! BUT IF IT WAS N-O-T A FALLING METEOR, THEN I DON`T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. THANKS FOR READING! SO LONG FOR NOW!"],"Date Submitted":"07/25/2010 11:11 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/25/2010 09:40 UTC","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-07252010-0010","Summary":"It looked like a meteor, but maybe not."}
