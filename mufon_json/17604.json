The light would go from dim to bright in about 2 seconds. It would then dart around a bit from side to side and up and down then fade out. This happened over a period of about an hour and a half or so in various locations, but all were roughly about the same altitude. I heard no airplane sounds of helicopter sounds associated with the lights. The number of times it appeared and dissappeared was about 4 to 5 times.
