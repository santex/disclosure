My son noticed an usual object in the sky. Object hovered but at the same time circular lights covered the outside of object and the lights were turning, lots of different colors. We turned onto 34th Street and followed object through a subdivision. There were lights that pulsated in and out. Object then crossed over 610 W. heading to the south and we lost sight of it. We called 911 and asked if anyone else noticed or reported an unusual glowing object. We know helicopters can hover in one spot, this was not a helicopter, there was no noise, we had our windows open and the lights moved in opposite directions, like 2 layers of lights. Have never seen anything like this before. My son is definitely affected, worried, anxious, close to freaking out."],"Longitude":"-95.429451","Date of the Event":"10/15/2011 07:25 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"29.817323","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Houston","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON"}
