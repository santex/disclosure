We saw some fireworks go off in the distance and then noticed a red-orange orb come straight up from behind some trees (but it looked like it was farther away - several miles) and stop. Thinking it may have been part of the fireworks, we watched it, expecting it to blow up. It stayed in the same spot for about 10 seconds and then slowly started drifting east through the sky. As it started drifting, we noticed another orb following behind it, moving at the exact same speed. We all just looked at it, in awe, wondering what it was (even kids were asking what they were). At that time one of us ran inside to grab a camera and filmed it. It continued to slowly move east through the sky and then the first one disappeared behind a cloud, followed by the second one. Please note that in the video, there is a reflection from a streetlight that you can see between the 2 orbs. It was a cloudy evening and you can see the objects disappear into the clouds, one after the other."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Two red-orange orbs float slowly across the sky during fireworks.","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 02:30 UTC","Region":"Washington","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.434681","Latitude":"47.253997","Log Number":"US-07052013-0019","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Tacoma","There was one other sighting in Tacoma on or around July 4th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.253997,+-122.434681(48643)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48643) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
