{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from work today. I was on Rt 30 heading eastbound, and the object appeared to my left, right before the exit to Rt 222. I saw this vertical light rod that seemed like it was glowing from inside-it was very bright.It was stationary at first and then began to move to the left,faded in brightness,came back within what seemed like half a second with 3 rods next to each other- and then completely disappeared.I kept looking at the skies to see if it would appear again-and it did!The last time I saw it, I was on Rt 276 eastbound-right before the Downingtown exit.The object which was in the beginning vertical, turned horizontal and then it looked like a saucer with a lid on top-and the top part of the saucer was not bright but looked metallic.It was very thin, and the bottom part of the object still was glowing.It then disappeared.Both incidents were less than 30 seconds long."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.037876,+-76.305514(13417)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13417) map </A>","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around October 30th 2008"],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-76.305514","Date of the Event":"10/30/2008 03:10 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/30/2008 03:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"13417","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13417.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13417.html"],"Latitude":"40.037876","City":"Lancaster","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10302008-0040","Summary":"Saw Rod Shaped Lights Twice","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown"}
