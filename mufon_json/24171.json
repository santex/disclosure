It almost looked like a helicopter that looks for criminals, but the orb was glowing bright orange. It then pulsed a few times, and as I stood there, it blinked out of sight. I have not drank in 9 years and no drugs, so I know what I saw. I also noticed that what felt like a few minutes was actually 38. I am still very shaken, I have never believed in UFOs or other beings, but my body feels strange and no idea what to do next. Can someone help?"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were 2 other sightings in Austin on or around July 5th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.273023,+-97.741061(24171)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24171) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Longitude":"-97.741061","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24171.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24171.html"],"Log Number":"US-07052010-0024","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.273023","Summary":"Orange ball shining light on homes then pulsed and disappeared.","Case Number":"24171"}
