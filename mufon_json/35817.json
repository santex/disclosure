At first I thought I was \"dizzy\" but it actually moved! The star traveled from south west to north east in an arc and as it moved farther away it dimmed until I could no longer see it. Aprox 45 seconds from the time I noticed it until it had dimmed. Perhaps falling space debris? Very strange---would love to know if anyone else in the northern Ca area of Sonoma saw this as well!"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Sonoma","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-122.451726","Case Number":"35817","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"02/14/2012 06:27 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.292879,+-122.451726(35817)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35817) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02142012-0026","Date Submitted":"02/14/2012 09:41 UTC"}
