{"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watering lawm in front of my home, I have a clear view of the sky and it was a perfect cloudless day. at about a 45 degree angle moving from east to west I see a silent slow moving ridged metalic looking boat just floating across the sky. oddly enough it didnt surprise me nor scare me. without a shadow of a doubt in my mind this was not a blimp, balloon, military or civillian craft. It was like a floating black boat? needless to say it was the most strange thing I have ever seen. since then ive constantly look up in the sky and have seen additional bizare craft but none like this."],"Date Submitted":"01/03/2010 07:36 UTC","Case Number":"21340","Date of the Event":"07/15/2006 07:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21340.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21340.html"],"Summary":"slow movimg metalic boat looking triangle. no sound, no vapor trail. moved right in front of me. saw perfect details","Latitude":"45.640988","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Washington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.640988,+-122.656546(21340)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21340) map </A>","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around July 15th 2006"],"City":"Vancouver","Object Features":"Other","Longitude":"-122.656546","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01032010-0011"}
