It was just after sunset and there was a solid cloud cover @ approx 2000ft, no stars or moon visible. The object came into my view and disappeared after about 45 seconds. Was not able to keep it in view the whole 45 seconds due to tree line and buildings along the route. Driving about 45-55 mph. I realize there is not much information here but I want to report in case there were other witnesses which might have more complete details and thereby have some corroboration."],"Date Submitted":"04/03/2013 07:32 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/29/2013 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04032013-0007","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46568.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46568.html"],"Latitude":"33.955526","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"46568","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.955526,+-79.176928(46568)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46568) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","City":"Aynor","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-79.176928"}
