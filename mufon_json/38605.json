What struck me immediately were 2 things, the color of the object, and the fact that it was stationary. It was easily 2 times the brightness of any other star or planet, and a pale orange color. Initially I suspected it to be an overhead satellite but the object was not moving. It was also too high to be a hovering helicopter. I watched it for perhaps 30 seconds, and then the object faded. It became as bright as one of the surrounding stars and then blinked out of existence from the naked eye."],"Latitude":"50.955732","Log Number":"CA-05292012-0003","Date of the Event":"05/27/2012 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Observed bright orange stationary orb in NW sky from SW Calgary., brighter than any other object in the night sky.
