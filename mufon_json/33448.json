I put on my shoes and took her out, as I walked off my front porch and began to turn toward my yard, I seen a bright light. The second I noticed it, I jerked my head around. That's when it let off a bright flash, almost camera like, and flew off leaving a trail a lot like a shooting star. At first I thought I was seeing things, but my puppy was also staring in the sky whining. We do have a lot of police and news helicopters through the area, so at first I thought it could have been that. But it was completely stationary when it caught my attention, and bolted off at a speed I've only seen jets achieve. I am completely bummed that for once, I didn't have my phone on me. It was definitely worth seeing."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:50","Longitude":"-85.242986","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"35.021966","Date Submitted":"11/18/2011 03:00 UTC"}
