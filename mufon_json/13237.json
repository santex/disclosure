picnic,it was the weekend.we contacted a friend,and asked him to join us.he agreed to do so,but he would come up in his own car,and would meet us there later, with his pregnant girlfriend, at the time(i e-mailed him to ask him the date,month,and year.the reason i did so, was because i did not recall the time line,i e-mailed him a couple of days ago,oct.23.08 to ask him..since,his girlfriend was pregnant.he would remember,he told me 1991,in the summer months,date,time no clue!!!).anyways,we packed a lunch,and were headed to st.jovite,in the laurentians.its a place i use to go fishing,since the mid 80s,with the buddy,that was to meet us later.it was a beatiful day,sunny,a very slight breeze,from west to east.there were some clouds,but few and far between.it was warm.we got to our destination.it was in ste.jovite,in the laurentians.it was ruisseau larose.this stream was fed by lake sauvage,and others...for location purposes.i believe highway 329 or 327 to get there. alright,we take the gear and stuff, outa the car, and head up the path,to a little lake,that the stream made...this took about 30-45minute walk up the mountain,to get there.it was a beautiful setting.the lake was maybe 700ft length by 300ft wide(approx.)we sat at the southeast end,overlooking the lake at its length...watching where the stream flowed into the lake.at that end of the lake,the stream flows down into the lake,the elevation,maybe 45 degrees.this description is for later corrolation,to the height of object off the ground.so were sitting there,enjoying the day,the scenery,and awaiting our friends to come up.as were sitting there,i notice,to my right(say northeast)this object,appox.100\\200ft above the tree line.the object was maybe 2000ft to the right of us.it was moving very slowly up\\down, jagged,erratic,shinny then flat,from east to west.i remember thinking,i know this might sound bizarre.i thought to myself,\"huh!,how people could throw there garbage in a prestine area.i thought what i saw,was a wrapping from a cigarette pack,the cellophane shinny\\flat,with the suns reflection.again,i've learned, that, that was a protection system from the rational, to kinda make sense of the irrational.as i watched the object moving towards the west,moving up\\down,erratically.and, the thoughts of the wrapper.the rational kicked in, and i started thinking, how can it be,there's a slight breeze from west to east,can't be a piece of garbage...100\\200ft above tree line,were up in the woods,its erratic movements,etc.. i had these thoughts firing in mind, as the object moved ever so slowly,moving up\\down, shinny\\flat.i analized.i knew,what it was..i quickly turned to my girlfriend,and said,\"look at that!\".she asked what it was?and said,that she was looking at it,too.i blurted out, at a million miles an hour,my thoughts.i told her,that i thought it was a piece of cellophane,then,that it couldn't be,because it was above the trees,slight breeze from west to east.anyways,the object was moving from east to west.she was in awe,and glued to it, as i was.while, we fired our views at each other.the object continued its path, until it was directly in front of us.it was at the other end of the lake(about 700ft linear).and,from level of the lake(45 degree elevation reference)maybe 200ft above the ground.anyways,the object stopped in front of us,hovered,went from shinny to flat.while it was hovering,we were still captivated,in awe,discussing what we were seeing.when all of a sudden,i reach for my eyes(cause,i could not see)and i say,\"my eyes,i can't see!\" i heard her say the same thing...about her eyes.what i experienced was,as best as i can describe it,like when you have cable problems,and the channel your watching is off air,and all you see is snow,or black and white dots.this is what i saw.i lost time\\we both did.the couple that was to meet us,were heading towards us.i don't know how much time elapsed.i just know we both looked at them,not even mentioning what had just happened.its funny,that,i e-mailed my buddy for date of event\\time.he remembers going but everything else...not much.when we left at the end of the day.my girlfriend and i discussed it,we went to a video store to lookup the phenomenom.we rifled through the videos on ufo's.when she landed on a picture of the object,that ressembled what we saw,she freaked in the store.the object seemed\\looked metallic.its shape was like,kinda\\sorta a diamond,a star,it was shinny,then flat.it looked as though it strecthed from up and down,or from side to side.the feelings i experienced were excitement,happiness,vindication.she was scared,frightened,excited.she did not believe what had just happened.she...is irish\\catholic background,it scared her a great deal.i said vindication,because all the years of telling the first two sightings,and seeing peoples reactions.also,i had told my girlfriend of my sightings,she believed me cause she loved me, but told me one time, prior to our sighting,that people thought,i was like the village idiot.this because, i would tell people of my sightings(the first two).
