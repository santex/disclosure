They weren't blinding at all. I was freaking out on the phone because I thought I'd never see one in my lifetime. The lights weren't moving at all for a second or too and they were perfectly horizontal. The light orb that was behind the other one disappeared and appeared in front of the one that has been there. Then that one disappears and appears again in front of the one that just appeared. Then they both just disappear completely. They were perfectly still lights, not extremely bright, not off extremely far either, and they were in a perfect horizontal line. I could see it because the parking lot was pretty empty and it was already dark outside."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-84.288472","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/05/2012 07:02 UTC","Summary":"2 orange lights hovering, disappearing, and reappearing in the sky","Date Submitted":"12/15/2012 03:42 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-12152012-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.180578,+-84.288472(44567)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44567) map </A>"}
