I saw a light high in the sky followed by 3 dimmer lights. They moved from southwest to northeast then dissapeared from view. They appeared to be very high in the atmosphere, perhaps in space. About 5 minutes went by and I saw them or another set of lights again in the same part of the sky. One rather bright light followed by 3 dimmer lights moving from southwest to northeast. Then they dissapeared from view. This happened in exactly the same way about every 5 minutes for 20 minutes or so. People around me either didn't see them or just were watching the show. My mother was another witness to this. I don't know what these lights were but they were very high, perhaps spacecraft. What struck me as odd was that I saw the same lights every 5 minutes."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
