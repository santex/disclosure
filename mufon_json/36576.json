{"Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile sitting on my patio, I looked up to observe an airplane passing nearby. I then looked up to take in the clear blue sky overhead when I noticed a glowing, spherical object hovering overhead. As it began to slowly move in a westerly direction, I thought it might be a balloon of some sort until it began to make very abrupt changes in its pathway and speed. It alternated from a hover to moving at different angles until it suddenly stopped for a moment and then moved vertical at a tremendous speed until it vanished. At the beginning of my observation of the object I was sure it was just a balloon, until witnessing the movements and the speed of its departure."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"28.123871","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.123871,+-82.347022(36576)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36576) map </A>","Longitude":"-82.347022","Object Features":"None","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36576.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36576.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/19/2012 10:24 UTC","Case Number":"36576","Log Number":"US-03192012-0007","Summary":"Glowing, silver orb","trends":["There have been 105 other sightings in Tampa","There were no other sightings in Tampa on or around March 16th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date of the Event":"03/16/2012 04:00 UTC","City":"Tampa"}
