I have just watched an documentary about aliens in Earth past. My window faces a major airport which I am use to seeing lights in the sky. Though this one caught my eye due to its size and color. It was red and the size was about star-like. I assumed it was a newly born star but as I looked closer I noticed it had blue lights to the left side of it. My younger brothers and cousins also saw the strange light. The object also seemed to wobble a little as it hovered. After about five minutes we stopped worrying about it. Though about 3 minutes later I look back and it was gone. I instantly knew it was a star nor a plane. What I saw matched the description of a UFO!"],"City":"Newark","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"35891","Date of the Event":"02/17/2012 08:28 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.740107,+-74.166317(35891)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35891) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02172012-0024","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/17/2012 09:01 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-74.166317","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","Summary":"A light that was red and had smaller blue lights to its left side.","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Newark","There were no other sightings in Newark on or around February 17th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.740107"}
