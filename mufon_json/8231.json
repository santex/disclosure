don���t know if they will occur again tonight and it is a cloudy afternoon and it is suppose to rain tonight. the following events occurred september 23 and 24th 2007. i was visiting a friends home in iron river and we had gotten up early to start painting her daughters room. we needed another paint roller so we were going to her boyfriends to pick up another one. when we left the house i saw blinking lights in the eastern sky (red and white) i said out loud ���what is that?��� i answered my self and said, ���oh it���s a plane���. on our way back from her boyfriend���s house (we were driving east) we saw a very bright light in the sky. the object had flashing lights like a police car it was less than 1000 feet from the ground. when we got back to my friend���s home, i looked where i had noticed the flashing lights earlier and the object was still there. we could not see the object we saw driving home from her house because of the tree line, so we decided to drive to the edge of town to get a better look at the second object. the object lights were changing. they changed from a horizontal row of (red on the edges, white in the middle and sometimes flashing blue green) to a vertical line, to a steady white in the middle and a glow of red on the edges. we looked around the sky and noticed 5 similar objects in the sky. the brightest and closest to the horizon was in the east, the first one i noticed was at a higher altitude in the south west, there were three at different altitudes and staggered straight up in the sky, one was in positioned at a very high altitude in the northwestern sky and the last nnw and at a lower altitude than the one in the sw but seemed to be farther away. all of the objects were stationary except for small erratic movements. when looking at them through a camera using the zoom they appeared to jump around. it was difficult to tell exactly what shape they were because they appeared to change shape. we were only able to take photos of the brightest one because of the others were not bright enough. in some of the photos it appears to be triangle or have boomerang shape in others it appears to be round. we were using my friend���s digital camera it has a 3.���s zooms lens and is 1.2 mega pixels, so the shots are somewhat grainy and unfocused because of the movement of the objects. at about 5:00 a.m. the object in the nnw sky moved quickly across the sky towards the brightest one, it flew above it and the hovered. my friend said it attached to the brighter on or something, but i did not see it. we observed the objects until daylight. as the sun rose so did the objects, strait up. we lost sight of the other objects before daybreak, i assume because they were started ascending at a higher altitude. we then drove to my friends��� boyfriend���s house again to get binoculars to look at the last object. the binoculars were not very strong but the object appeared to be gray or sliver and i am not quite certain of the shape, again it kept changing. however, we did watch the brightest and closest one until after the sun rose it ascended straight up until it was no longer visible. it appeared we were able to get photos of it in the daylight but they are at a very high altitude. later in the day (sept. 23rd) i returned to bayfield and told my children and showed them photos of what i had seen. my son said it must have been mars or venus, my response was that venus and mars move on the horizon, these objects (least one) did not move for almost three hours, and i���ve never seen venus or mars rise straight into the heavens. at about 8:00 p.m. i was bringing things to my car to take to iron river and looked at the sky to see if what i saw last evening was going to happen again. in the distant sky to the south i saw what i thought was similar to the objects i had seen last night. i showed it to my son and he said it was a twinkling star. as i was leaving about 10 minutes later it was no longer there, i looked to the west and saw i am certain the same type of object (it was not like the very bright one) i had seen last night. my son (27 years old) and daughter (16 years old) were looking at it and he said it must be a plane. after about 5 minutes of viewing the object changing colors shape and brightness, i asked if he still thought it was a plane because it had not moved out of the position it was in. he agreed he had never seen anything like it. i left for iron river at about 8:20 while driving i noticed another object over lake superior in chequamegon bay near washburn. when i arrived in iron river i scanned the sky and although very distant i saw 4 objects. there was a group of three that if you drew line to each object you could form triangle (with the point facing downward) the two on the upper part of the triangle were wsw and ese the bottom one was south. they were fairly easy to identify in the sky, but were still quite a distance and the objects behaved in much the same way as the previous evening. i was not able to photograph the top two, however i did get a few of the bottom one later that evening. the photo is dark but when zoomed in you can see a very colorful lighted something, each photo takes on a different shape. i used cannon power shot s3 digital camera 6.0 mega pixels and 12x-image zoom. i���m not sure if the distortion is from my movement or the objects. i took a short video of the object using max zoom and (i am not moving this time) and you can see how the objects move around, they also take on a ball shape when using max zoom. because of this problem i did not use the max zoom and it was easier to focus the camera with a bigger pallet. the moon was still up and very bright and i did not see an object that was bright enough to continue photographing, so i went to bed. i set the alarm for 4:00 after the moon would set to see if one of the objects would appear brighter and lower in the horizon. i took a short drive to look for the object because the tree line is pretty high at my friend���s house. i got to u.s. hwy 2 turned east and there was a very bright object like the night before. i went east on hwy 2 of town to get closer and away from the streetlights i drove about two miles and pulled off on the shoulder and started taking pictures. i observed two objects south of the bright one and one nw, i also saw in the east (quite a distance away) two very faint lights blue and red in color, with the red closest to the sky. i will also note that the closest object in the southern direction was lighted all blue and did not change color or intensity of color like the others however it did move slightly and change shape like the others. the bright one during the course of the evening was ever changing at times down to one small white light with a red hue. it also changed to extremely bright once during the night and had what appeared to be a red to be some kind ball or light that swarmed around it and then vanished. the object than returned to its original brightness. a craft then came from the west it was making quick turns and appeared to be moving very fast. it then went by the bright object and started mirror the movements of the brighter object and then took off very quickly to the east. i continued to observe the objects and when the sun started to rise the objects started to rise vertically towards the heavens like the morning before until they were no longer visible. i was able to get photos of the bright object in the daylight and took a total of about 200 photos of these two very strange evenings. i am still unsure as to the shape of the objects, because when the zoom is used the object appears round and when i zoom out the object appears to take some kind of shape. either that or the object has the ability to change its shape. i also want to note that i did not hear any noise from the object. i also called the bayfield county sheriff���s office on monday to see if anyone reported seeing anything in the sky and was told there were no reports. i also about 10 years ago saw a similar object on m 28 in the up just past bruces crossing. that time i was able to see that the object was triangle shaped and had blue red and white lights shining down from the corners. my sister witnessed this sighting with me. she is of the opinion that this is the government testing new crafts. i disagree, i don���t believe we have the technology to build an object that has no engine noise and can move as quickly or as agile what i saw. i also asked her why the objects if they were government crafts exit via the heavens. if you have an explanation i eagerly await one. i would also like to note that on the photos taken on the 23rd the date on the photos says the 22nd also the time i believe is 1 hour off. the camera may have been set wrong. sincerely, betty kerr"],"Date Submitted":"09/23/2007 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF =
