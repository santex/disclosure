No lights","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was only about a half hour to 45 minutes after the ball dropped on new years. My mom and I were out front with the dog when she suddenly points up and says \"oh look a shooting.....\" then realizing it wasn't a shooting star. She pointed it out to me and at the time I had a 5mw laser with a visible beam. So I shined the object and it seemed to take a speeding path in almost what seemed to be a zig zag form. while I was shining the laser, you could clearly see the path that this object was taking in the dark sky. It had no lights that we noticed. It was very fast and after a brief moment or two, it disappeared into the sky. At one point it was almost directly over top of us. We were in complete awe, as my mom and I have never seen anything like this in our lives. I had friends call me crazy and laugh in my face, I know what I saw and believe this isn't anything that we know about."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34630.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34630.html"],"Region":"Florida","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01052012-0015","Longitude":"-80.053766","Latitude":"26.617392","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Oval","Case Number":"34630"}
