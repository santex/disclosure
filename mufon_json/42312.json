We all saw it from the front yard of a house. At first we thought it was a plane, it was the same approx. size, but way too brightly lit to be a plane. The entire thing looked like a fireball, but we quickly ruled out a meteorite because it wasn't going fast enough and was maintaining altitude. At one point we considered it might be a plane actually ablaze, but again ruled that out because it was maintaining altitude and a steady speed. It was completely orange in color and very bright. It was hard to say how big it was or how far away it was, but at around the same time we watched it fly across the sky, an airplane also flew nearby, and it looked to be roughly the same size and altitude. We didn't hear anything, did not see it land, or see anything detach or project from it. It just flew across the sky, South to North. I lost sight of it when it proceeded on it's course over a row of trees in the backyard."],"City":"Elko New Market","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"42312","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/03/2012 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-09052012-0008","Date Submitted":"09/05/2012 02:33 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42312.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42312.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Minnesota","Tags":"City"}
