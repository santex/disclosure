A reddish orange light came flying over my house, several thousand feet up. I quickly went through the possibilities of what the light could be and eliminated all of them. It flew slightly faster than a plane, but had not other lights on it. It drifted slightly to my right, then back to my left. It's non-linear light made me realize it wasn't a plane or a meteor. I watched it go over a tree and continue north. The crazy part of this experience is that I yelled at it to stop - and it did. It held still for about 15 to 20 seconds. It sort of came back towards me, then slowly disappeared. Another strange thing was that the while the light was visible, and for several minutes afterwards, there wasn't a single mosquito around me, which is really rare since they are thick right now and I can't be in my backyard without getting several bites every minute. It was truly the most amazing thing I've ever experienced."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/25/2010 10:22 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around June 25th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"23953","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.259373,+-95.995378(23953)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23953) map </A>","Object Features":"None","City":"Omaha","Region":"Nebraska","Longitude":"-95.995378"}
