It was so bright and large that I thought an airplane had caught fire and was going to crash. It took a split second for me to realize I was looking at something I could not identify. It was probably several hundred feet wide and had vents which released an intense amber colored glow. It was long and thin, almost cigar shaped (however I do not believe this to be the true shape of the object). My parents stepped outside just as it \"collapsed\" upon itself. To my suprise it reappeared in a few seconds slightly north but at least a mile away. Its amber glow was still clearly visible. The craft disappeared and reappeared at least once more, even further away. My parents claim two fighter jets flew over the area soon following the sighting. While I heard them, I did not see them. The amber lighted craft has been seen in this area on and off for over a year now."],"Summary":"Large elongated craft with glowing","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fisk","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
