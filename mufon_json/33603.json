A hot summer afternoon, clouds were of course forming. I saw something between two of these clouds, which seemed to be a cloud itself, but it had a more defined shape. It was, as best I can describe it, like the rear half of a stingray. (Triangle with a long point.) I watched it for less than a minute, I guess. The clouds on either side continued building and morphing. The \"object\" vanished in a way I would describe as similar to \"cloaking\" ships seen on television."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.311701,+-79.958162(33603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33603) map </A>"}
