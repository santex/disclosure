Then as i kept driving i noticed that it was moving. And it kept moving toward the mountain around where i live. So i turned down my street and stopped to see if i could hear anything or see blinking lights. I sat for around 5 minutes watching it as it remained silent and flying toward the mountain. I first noticed it because how bright it was and i love looking at the stars every night so it was out of the ordinary. I thought it was a star when i first saw it. I thought that UFO's didn't visit Georgia, but after tonight i have no doubt. Finally after being stopped at a stop sign watching the object with my car turned off, i lost it behind the trees, where i started my car to see if i could catch a better view around the hills. but i didn't."],"Date Submitted":"11/13/2012 11:26 UTC","Region":"Georgia","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"34.081619","Summary":"I saw these three lights looking like a very bright star, but moving toward the mountain, so i stopped to watch.","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.081619,+-84.438957(43897)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43897) map </A>","Case Number":"43897","Country":"United States","City":"Marietta","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"11/13/2012 11:05 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11132012-0014","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
