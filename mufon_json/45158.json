While sitting outside one afternoon, I noted above the treeline, there were hovering lights above the holler from treeline to treeline in all directions. The colors were muted and were pink, yellow and orange . All the family members were outside during this time. My uncle, my mom, my aunt and myself were witnesses. Everyone stayed still for about 10-15 minutes, as if transfixed. Then I looked again at the treeline and they were gone. I asked my uncle if he'd seen what I had seen and he said \"yeah, that's our UFO. We see it all the time.\" Everyone seemed unfazed about this sighting. My uncle, aunt, sister and mom did not react in the slightest at seeing this. No one wanted to talk about it when I asked about it. I told a MUFON member about it approx. 20 years ago."],"Log Number":"US-01112013-0019","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
