It looked as big as a 747! I watched in amazement as the object continued south-southwest and crossed Briarglen Drive. As it went over the houses and trees there it began to descent sort of to the southeast towards the lake, and I lost sight of it. It was elongated with 5 to 8 amber-colored lights located horizontally along the midline of the craft."],"City":"Atlanta","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 95 other sightings in Atlanta","There were no other sightings in Atlanta on or around January 14th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"01/14/2012 08:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"37466","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.88711,+-84.216096(37466)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37466) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/14/2012 11:14 UTC","Tags":"City"}
