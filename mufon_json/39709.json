I saw lots of activity. The attached video shows some of it. Boring stuff, but it shows the activity above us. This was recorded about 1:30 AM on June 22, 2012. Basically I wait to see something happening and then turn on the camcorder. In future I will run with the camcorder on all the time. What I also saw with my night vision on, was a boomerang or gull wing craft streaking throught the sky. It had metallic silvery blue lights at each wing tip. I could clearly see structure to the craft and a bit of reflection from the ground lights. It blew my mind and reaffirmed all of my other sigthings to date. I also saw a small fleet cross the sky. There were about 8 in an unequal V formation with about 4 stragglers behind it. I have not personally seen a fleet before. I feel priviledged."],"Summary":"orbs, gull wing craft. small fleet","Latitude":"53.526275","Case Number":"39709","Longitude":"-113.266144","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Sherwood Park","There were 3 other sightings in Sherwood Park on or around June 22nd 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Region":"Alberta"}
