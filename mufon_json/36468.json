{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw a small orb that looks like a faded light blue star passing over my neighborhood at 9:51pm. It went NW. It's the second time it happens, but this time was just one, and it moved on a straight line. On New Years eve me and my friends witnessed around 12 of them, and since them it's hard to not look to the sky at night. It is so faded it's hard to see if you're not paying attention. It's hard to believe is some kind of balloon because the wind was in a different direction."],"Log Number":"US-03142012-0018","trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around March 13th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"None","City":"Orlando","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"36468","Date Submitted":"03/14/2012 11:12 UTC","Summary":"A small orb passed over my neighborhood","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"28.432127","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.432127,+-81.386225(36468)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36468) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.386225","Date of the Event":"03/13/2012 09:51 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36468.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36468.html"]}
