Stepped outside and continued talking. When it got closer it looked like 3 white lights right next to each other. I told my girlfriend I thought I might be seeing something strange. I thought it might be a plane going to crash or something because it was so low. As it moved over my neighbors house it appeared as the above description. Was very large, not making any sound nor were the lights blinking. It just hovered there. I hung up the phone and tried to wake my mother and brother, the thing was still there when I got back out. I got in my car and called 911 and started driving away. I felt an immense state of fear and panic, horror, confusion and absolute terror. I lost sight of it while speeding away, it seemed to follow me for a bit then took off in another direction. I actually drove across my neighbors lawn I was so scared. It was like living in a nightmare, I hope to never experience something like this again."],"Region":"New York"}
