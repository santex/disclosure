The extremely bright object was moving very quickly and seemed rather large. It was so bright that it appeared white hot. It had the appearance of having a short comet like tail. It traveled from south to north rather low above the western horizon (which for me was a group of trees that line my neighbors property and our street). I watched it for about 5 mins trying to figure out what it was. It was traveling at a good clip. So I ran in a grabbed my camera. I came back and filmed it for a few minutes. When I look at the film on my computer, it is almost impossible to see the sky was so bright. But I was able to save a couple of stills from the film and adjust them so it is easier to see."],"Longitude":"-99.898923","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/14/1951 08:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Extremely bright fireball","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/14/1951 08:15 UTC","Latitude":"31.972159","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.972159,+-99.898923(11247)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11247) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06202008-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11247.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11247_submitter_file1__6-20-08comet.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11247_submitter_file2__Web6-20-08cometadjusted.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11247_submitter_file3__Web6-20-08cometadjusted.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11247.html"]}
