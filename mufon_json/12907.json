I look up puzzled and I saw what seemed to be a UFO. The sighting was near London City Airport so it may have been a plane, but I doubt it. At first I thought it was a plane but then, I've never heard a plane make that noise. It was a humming noise, not like plane engines. When I looked up I was puzzled. It looked very close, lower than most planes. It was a disc dotted with lights. Coloured round the edges with two blue lights at the rear. It flew steadily, going over my house, which is when I lost track of it. That wasn't the end. For the next 20 minutes we saw a massive increase in plane activity, at two points seeing a plane with an exceptionally bright light at the front (goverment search ships, or alien scouts?). This sighting was somewhat unlikely. I do live near an airport, but if there are additional sightings, we may have \"visitors\"."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.512739,+-0.123885(12907)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12907) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"London","Log Number":"GB-10032008-0011","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/03/2008 08:10 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/03/2008 08:10 UTC"}
