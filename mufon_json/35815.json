Towards downtown Hollywood, there was a large, bright (what looked to be on fire) ball. When it moved, it left a trail that is similar to a shooting star. The object would hover, then quickly climb diagonally, then to the side, then drop and shoot up - did this several times, in all directions. It finally appeared to move away quickly and then just disappeared. My neighbor said it started off as 3 balls of fire, but two were gone by the time I witnessed this. Definitely have never seen anything like this before. I grew up in Colorado Springs where there are tons of military happenings in the sky."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","City":"Los Angeles","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35815.html"],"Summary":"Fireballs in sky changing direction quickly","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/14/2012 09:11 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-118.292328","Latitude":"34.067469","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
