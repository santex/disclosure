I assumed it was an aircraft at cruising altitude, but there were no flashing lights as I would expect(and I'm not familiar with intense green lights on a plane). Also, while not moving at blazing speed, it was much faster than aircraft I've seen, covering several degrees of the sky in about ten seconds. I then lost my view of it through my windshield as it was far above my car. Within thirty seconds I had pulled into a parking lot, got out to find it again, but it was gone. When I got home several hours later, I googled \"green light in sky\", found several similar sightings, but no explanations."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.733511","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/10/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10112009-0005","Summary":"Bright green light travelling across sky","Latitude":"30.268663","Date Submitted":"10/11/2009 04:03 UTC","Case Number":"19893","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19893.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19893.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.268663,+-97.733511(19893)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19893) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
