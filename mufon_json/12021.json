At first I dismissed it as the refraction off my windshield, but then as I turned, it remained in my vision. Once I arrived at my house, I realized I was the only one home, but I still went to pursue it. But as I got to the end of my driveway, a fox ran across the lawn directly across the street, startling me quite badly, but I went to go on, and then another fox ran directly behind me across the drive way, and I wussed out, and called it quits. Close to 7 years in this house, and I have yet to be scared, save this night. Anyone else see anything? It could not have been hard to miss."],"Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Cross","Date of the Event":"08/04/2008 11:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.554581","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00"}
