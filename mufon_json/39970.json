Two small yellow lights with a big red shimmering ball of red above and centered. Kind of looked like it was on fire . It hovered for a minute or two, then went straight up for maybe a few hundred feet, stopped for a moment, then slowly moved away from me. It made no noise that I could hear. Wind was variable and was faster than the object appeared to move. Watched it head NNE at a static altitude then after about 5 minutes the lights disappeared. The yellow lights were solid and had definite outlines, perfectly round with no spots, the red orb in the center above shimmered. I thought for a second it was one of those lanterns people launch, but it was clear it wasn't after it started to move. The movements were very straight and were going in a direction different than the prevailing winds. And it was too steady a path."],"City":"Morris","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39970.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39970.html"],"Region":"Illinois","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Red shimmering orb, pulsating, rising streamers, yellow solid lights","Log Number":"US-06302012-0032","Date Submitted":"06/30/2012 11:27 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Sphere","Country":"United States"}
