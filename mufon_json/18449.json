{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were sitting in the hot tub, watching the sky. My husband suddenly said, \"What the hell is that?\". I looked at him and he was looking directly over the roof toward the north. There appeared a bright circular object passing in a southerly direction, directly overhead. We both looked up and followed its path with our eyes from the top of the roof across sky, until we lost sight through the trees. I was facing south and watched it pass overhead as it headed south. In a matter of a few seconds, approximately 3, it was gone, so it had to be incredibly fast. It was many times larger than the stars in the sky. There was no tail, just a bright object, no sound."],"Date of the Event":"08/02/2009 10:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18449","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.37226,+-83.34635(18449)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18449) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/02/2009 10:45 UTC","Latitude":"42.37226","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"bright circular object shot overhead - horizon to horizon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18449.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18449.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.34635","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","City":"Livonia","Log Number":"US-08022009-0014","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Livonia","There were no other sightings in Livonia on or around August 2nd 2009"],"Source":"MUFON"}
