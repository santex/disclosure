I am only now reporting this as I was unaware of the existence of MUFON until I saw a TV show about it just now. Oddly it was about numerous UFO's appearing in Kokomo Indiana on April, 16 2008, and it was very interesting to me as I was in that town on exactly that date. This event happened at night, probably around 21:00 or so. My wife and I were sitting on the front step of the Missionary Baptist Church on Blue Lick road, in front of HTP, just talking about our day. I was staring at a star as my wife was talking and suddenly noticed I was \"mentally locked onto it\". Her voice seemed to fade into secondary awareness and the star became my primary point of awareness as though I were being hypnotized or entranced by it. It was an unusual feeling that I have not had before. Then suddenly it began to move slowly. I asked my wife if she was seeing what I was seeing and she said yes. We both watched it moving slowly toward us. I looked at her, and she asked if I thought it may be a UFO, and I said, \"It's not a plane, that���s for sure.\" We were both very young at the time and I remember making a funny remark, \"If you���re a UFO then prove it.\" We both just looked at each other and laughed��� but it suddenly stopped as soon as I had finished saying this. It remained still for a moment and me and my wife looked at each other and just giggled even though we were a bit afraid and amazed. Then, moving extremely fast, it suddenly darted to the left and then came to a sudden and complete stop. It then darted toward us, horizon to horizon, and just stopped again in less than a second���s time. It did this again two more times, forming a perfect square in the sky and stopped exactly where it had begun. We both were amazed by what appeared to be successful communication with it; and neither of us was laughing anymore��� we were excited and astonished. It then began to move slowly away, and when it reached a certain point, BOOM it flew away so fast it almost seemed to have disappeared. I believe in my mind that there was something like a telepathic link between myself and the phenomenon. First was the unusual feeling, as if it were getting my attention. Second, it correctly chose to make a square in the sky to prove that it was not a plane or meteor; which is exactly what I would have wanted and expected if someone wanted to prove this to me. I suppose it knew this telepathically. This is not the last time this event has occurred. Almost a year ago, on a construction project I was working on for a friend, at night about the same time, 21:00 or so, I was looking down at the ground, when I felt the same feeling. I immediately recognized it and looked up. My friend was there and saw this take place. When I looked up, I saw the same thing I saw almost ten years ago, a moving star. It was if it were tapping me on the shoulder and saying, ���hey, were still watching���. I then explained to my friend how something very similar had happened to my wife and me years ago. I don���t believe or disbelieve that aliens, angles, or whatever it is are visiting us and playing mind games, but I know for a personal fact, from real experience, that the phenomenon is undeniably real. My feeling, my opinion, is that they are not ���space ships��� but some sort of intelligent living beings. I���ve learned to keep this to myself, as others think I am lying or crazy. Words can���t adequately describe the depth of such an experience, and you simply have to see it to believe it. So I never tell anyone anymore. If you want to ���see one���, all I can say is, they are real, they are out there, and I would bet that if you put the right effort into having the experience, you wouldn���t be disappointed. There is a connection between us and them, and they are up to something. I look for interesting things to take place in the near future. I do not wish to be contacted. I just wanted to share the story with someone who could appreciate it. If it happens again, I will write again."],"City":"Louisville","Date Submitted":"11/30/1995 09:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Telepathic link.","Country":"United States","Region":"Kentucky","Log Number":"US-01042009-0027","Date of the Event":"11/30/1995 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.261585","Longitude":"-85.754556","Case Number":"14750","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14750.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.261585,+-85.754556(14750)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14750) map </A>"}
