Knowing there was no tower, or other such lighted structure there, went outside with camera to investigate. There was no noise, thus it was'nt a helicopter. Took 3 pictures, and before I could take more, the BRAND NEW batteries in camera went dead. Watched for 10 minutes then it just disappeared."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Locust Grove","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-84.109083","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","City":"Locust Grove","Case Number":"17734","Date Submitted":"06/30/2009 04:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17734.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17734_submitter_file1__IMG_0253.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17734_submitter_file2__IMG_0254.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17734_submitter_file3__IMG_0255.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17734.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Region":"Georgia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.34595","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Hovering object over woods.","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.34595,+-84.109083(17734)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17734) map </A>","Log Number":"US-06302009-0004"}
