{"divs":["Sighting DetailsJuly 29, 2004 My family and I were camping on Henvey Island approx. 3 miles duesouth from the town of Key Harbour on Georgian Bay, Ontario Canada. My son wastaking pictures of the sunset he did not see a craft in the sky but he didcapture what appears to be a craft on our digital camera. Attached you will find3 pictures that were taken within a period of two minutes. The last image has awhite self-illuminating triangular object in front of the setting sun. My sonnoticed this image a few minutes after taking the picture when viewing thepictures on the LCD screen on the camera back. These pictures have not beenretouched or affected in any way. I had a professional photographer look at theimage to see if he could explain away what was captured with the camera - lightreflection, spot on lens, bird, etc. - he was not able to explain away whatappears to be some sort of self-illuminated craft."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Key Harbour","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"07/29/2004 09:04 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"White self-illuminating triangle caught with digit","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3211.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"","City":"Key Harbour","Longitude":"-80.716667","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.883333,+-80.716667(3211)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3211) map </A>","Latitude":"45.883333","Date Submitted":"07/29/2004 09:04 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Ontario","Case Number":"3211","Country":"Canada","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
