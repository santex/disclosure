{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailsmy son and i were coming back from the mall. it was around dusk, not dark but getting there. we saw this triangle shape air craft just hovering over the express way. you couldn't help but notice it. it wasn't making any noise, just hanging there like someone painted it in the sky. i couldn't really study it because i was driving but my son could. i got off the express way so i could get a better look but when i turned around, which took aprox. 10 seconds it was gone. i listened to the news, read the paper,but it wasn't talked about anywhere. i know people had to have seen it, because it wasn't even dark but it wasn't mentioned."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28505.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28505.html"],"Log Number":"US-04012011-0012","Summary":"saw it hovering over express way","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.015417,+-83.684106(28505)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28505) map </A>","Case Number":"28505","Date Submitted":"04/01/2011 11:01 UTC","Longitude":"-83.684106","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Flint","There were no other sightings in Flint on or around July 10th 2000"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Flint","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/10/2000 07:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"43.015417"}
