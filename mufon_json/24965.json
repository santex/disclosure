{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-08052010-0021","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsSaw 3 star shaped objects traveling across the sky around 10 PM outside of Edgerton, Kansas. At first I thought these objects were satellites. However they were following each other and making 90 degree turns. They came from the North East and went to the South then to South West. They seemed to have been making a square pattern. Not sure what to make of it. I'm going back out tonight to see if they are there again. If anyone else is seeing the same stuff please post it. Thanks."],"Summary":"3 Lights NE To S To SW.","Latitude":"38.818091","City":"Gardner","Case Number":"24965","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.818091,+-94.919727(24965)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24965) map </A>","Longitude":"-94.919727","Region":"Kansas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"08/05/2010 07:26 UTC","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Gardner","There were no other sightings in Gardner on or around August 4th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"08/04/2010 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24965.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24965.html"],"Tags":"City"}
