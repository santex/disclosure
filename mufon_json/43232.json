(about thiry five miles away from us.) All I could see were three square blue lights at the rear (I guess) of the craft. These three lights were horizontally placed about 5-6 ft. apart. I could not make out any size, shape or color of the craft. It was totally concealed except for the three blue lights. I would have to guess that it was traveling around 400-500 MPH. As it neared the far southern horizon it turned suddenly and started heading west while decending quickly. If I were venture a guess as to the landing site, I would have to say Mir Mar, not San Diego. The obsolute amazing thing was that this craft made no sound at all except for the \"whooshing\" of the air as the craft pushed through it. I grew up an Air Force brat and have lived on many military bases from Florida to Okinawa and Japan. I have never seen or heard a craft like this one."],"Summary":"Traveling low with no or hardly any sound","Log Number":"US-10142012-0005","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.217261,+-117.293177(43232)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43232) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/14/2012 02:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
