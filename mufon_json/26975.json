The candle started shooting in the air and my Father was standing next to me . about half way through the candle a red orb like craft with three yellow lights under it flew over our neighbors house . The craft did not make a sound and was flying pretty low . My dad then screamed out whoaaaaa !!! Did you see that? I said hell yea i saw that it wasnt a plane not that low and that quiet . The sighting gave me a chill and I know it was something not from this earth. After the incident i told everyone what we had saw and they basically thought we were nuts. But I know what we saw and my father was the only witness."],"City":"Niskyuna","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26975.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26975.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-73.87719","Latitude":"42.805614","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.805614,+-73.87719(26975)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26975) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:24 UTC","Log Number":"US-12142010-0009"}
