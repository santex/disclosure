It was roughly 9:30 and I noticed a bright orange orb in the sky and having seen them before (most notably in '97) I was immediately taken aback. I watched the one orb for maybe a second or two and then saw two bright orange orbs come out of nowhere. They circled the original orb and then move to hover over it. Forming an upside down triangle. I watched for another moment or two and the botton one faded away. The newest two ones stayed for a moment drifting back and forth and then slowly faded away about 2 or three minutes later. About 10 minutes later, I was watching the sky and saw five bright white lights blinking somewhat like a plane but very, very bright. They were spread pretty far apart blinking intermittantly."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-12312010-0008","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Lakeland","There were no other sightings in Lakeland on or around December 31st 2010"],"City":"Lakeland","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.041825,+-81.940694(27183)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27183) map </A>"}
