This activity continued for about 10-20 minutes before disappearing behind the trees out of my view. When I first saw this, I was sitting in my truck talking on the telephone. I then hung up with the person I was talking to and called my wife outside. We both watched this for about five minutes before we lost sight. Now I live close to a military branch ( Fort A.P. Hill). So this could very well be some kind of new technology our government is working with. I have never seen anything like this and is wondering if there is some kind of explanation? The Camera on my cell phone could not pick it up."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-04122011-0015","Case Number":"28647","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28647.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28647.html"],"Summary":"Sittiing in my truck, I saw a light moving from left to right changing from red to white at incredible speed","Latitude":"37.544305","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
