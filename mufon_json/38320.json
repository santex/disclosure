I am used to seeing planes fly over in to Islip but these were higher than the planes in the usually flight path to land and were moving in all kinds of directions at a high rate of speed for their distance and altitude. Some were brighter than the others and all same blinking lights. I had never seen anything like it. It caught my attention right away because it looked so different than the usual planes in the area. Some other people stopped to look on as well. I looked online and there were the same orange orbs reported in Brooklyn the same night."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05212012-0005","Date Submitted":"05/21/2012 12:15 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Bohemia","Longitude":"-73.106012","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38320.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38320.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/20/2012 09:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.773205,+-73.106012(38320)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38320) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"About 8 very bright orange orbs that also had blinking triangular lights moving around Long Island sky near Islip airport."}
