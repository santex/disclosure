We were facing south, some overcast clouds when we noticed what looked like 2 stars that made eyes, with a cloud nose, and cloud mouth. We were laughing that it looked like a face. It was a perfect face. Then all of a sudden the right eye of our face started moving from south west to east. It was perfectly round and not very far away from us. An approaching for landing 747 jet passed under it ( we are in the path for the airport)and we think that's why it started moving east. It was under the cloud cover as we watched it perfectly move into a cloud and lost it. It was not out in space at all. It was sitiing there in our face that we saw. So wierd. We see this stuff all the time. I have reported several of these sightings."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"16049","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in West Jordan","There were no other sightings in West Jordan on or around March 14th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
