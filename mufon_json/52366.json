I thought it was strange. still looking up, I notice a boomerang shape object with 8 to10 lights along the objects length, the object looked grayish or transparent in the nite sky. I believe it to be traveling approx. 4 to 5 times faster than an airliner. Altitude approx.15000 to 20000 ft. Traveling south to north and kept the same heading. I watched for 35 sec until it was out of site. I tried to debunk this observation, but couldn't. I am excited and feeling lucky that I witnessed this incident and believe it to be a craft that was seen in Phoenix Arizona. I feel a strong need to report this and hope someone else did see this"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Salem","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"45.027085","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Boomerang"}
