Looked directly at the object and it lasted about a second felt like a lifetime and it was gone. No Direct way to tell size or distance due to lack of surrounding objects. What was odd was how the light went away it didn't fade or change direction it was stationary the whole time. It just was gone. I am not a believer of Aliens but this freaked me right out. Wonder if it is some kind of military object or something I dont know just would like to know if someone else saw something tonight."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.214067,+-84.552761(15668)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15668) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/22/2009 11:10 UTC","Longitude":"-84.552761","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15668.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15668.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/22/2009 11:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02232009-0001"}
