I looked up and initially thought it was a fire moving along wires that pass in that area. I quickly ran to the front door and opened it and saw that it was much higher in the sky than I had thought...appearing to be the height of a small plane passing overhead, below the clouds. It looked like an orange ball of fire. My friend saw it as well. The flight was steady and in almost a straight line, traveling from south to north. traveled perhaps a BIT eastward, but primarily northward. We watched until it grew smaller (as it became more distant) and disappeared in the northern sky, looking like it went into the clouds. It did not appear to be descending, but kept a steady elevation. Light did not brighten or dim, but remained constant. It appeared to be an orb, like a fireball."],"Latitude":"42.300965","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"44279","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Kalamazoo","There were no other sightings in Kalamazoo on or around December 1st 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.300965,+-85.609909(44279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44279) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date Submitted":"12/01/2012 10:18 UTC","Log Number":"US-12012012-0015"}
