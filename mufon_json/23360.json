In the eastern sky I saw something that looked like a star descend at a veryfast speed to the point that you only saw it again when it stoped for a second. I thought I was tripin cause I really don't believe in what I haven't seen before. Then this star looking thing was still very high in the sky and it traveled from east to west above me with this amazing speed that you couldn't see it until it stoped again. Then it just vanished. I know what I saw. I don't know what it was, but it darn sure wasn't a plane. Also at the time I seen this there wasn't a star in the sky yet."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-99.892353","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Summary":"It looked like a bright star in the distance.","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"23360","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"31.973979","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"05/18/2010 10:38 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/18/2010 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05182010-0018"}
