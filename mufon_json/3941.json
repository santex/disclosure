At that time I was living with my parents on a dairy farm, and in the early morning hours my mother and I would both take a break and go out to see it. One morning Mom and I both said \"There it is!\", but we were pointing at different objects. There in the sky were not one, but two star-sized lights. One was in the lead of the other, but on a parallel orbital path. The best way to describe this is that one was approx. 6 inches behind, and in a path approx. 1 inch westward of the leader, as seen from our vantage point on Earth. They continued in this formation until they had both disappeared from sight. I can no longer remember what the month or date where, but it was a perfectly clear night, not all that usual here. We didn't make any sort of report of this for many reasons, but for the most part because A) We didn't know where to do so, and B) The ridicule factor of being \"UFO nuts\". I have no idea if this info is of any use, but here it is."],"Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-10022005-0009","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon"}
