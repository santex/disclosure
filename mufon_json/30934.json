Evan wilderness area. The area we were hiking in is located 8-10 miles north of Grant, CO off of Guanella Pass Rd. We have a before and after photo, in which we cannot ascertain the identity of the object in one of our photos. If possible we would really like to have a second set of eyes to review the before and after photo. I can be reached @ 720-583-0569 for any further info. My wife, who is a serious skeptic of these cases has really come to question her beliefs in these matters. We are both open to any further questions.
