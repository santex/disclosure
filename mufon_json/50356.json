I was the sky a lot to monitor the clouds. I was told there was an airshow being held this weekend and did notice more planes than usual. But what i saw as i looked around shocked me. I saw three very tiny white dot's extremely high up in the sky. This side of the sky was the all blue part. I noticed the three dot's were equal distance from each other forming a 'v' shape. My first thought was \"star's?\" Couldn't be- it was day light. Second thought was satellites but again, no. I knew they were way, way too high up to be a plane or what not. I then noticed a 4th one in front of the formation but of greater distance away and towards the left. I took video aand photo's but after the last picture was taken i couldn't see them any more. I have tried hard to zoom in on the photo's to show proof but my cell phone isn't the best."],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Everett","There were no other sightings in Everett on or around September 1st 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.988085,+-122.197229(50356)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50356) map </A>","Tags":"City","Region":"Washington","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","City":"Everett","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50356.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50356_submitter_file2__IMG20130901162332.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50356_submitter_file3__IMG20130901162335.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50356_submitter_file4__IMG20130901162336.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50356_submitter_file5__IMG20130901162400.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50356.html"],"Case Number":"50356","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
