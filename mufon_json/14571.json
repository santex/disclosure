I was looking up at the constellation Orion when some clouds to my left cleared. Once the clouds moved away, I saw a sky-blue light that was stationary in the sky. At first I thought it was just a really bright star, but I have never seen a bluish star before. As I sat there, looking at this thing, the light coming from this object became more intense then would fade back to it's original brightness. The object would continue to do this, from going dull, to an intense brightness. This lasted for about ten minutes and it would never move. In the end, the light became super bright then faded into the darkness of the night sky."],"Date of the Event":"11/24/2008 11:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-12282008-0009","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","City":"Tyler","Latitude":"32.35679"}
