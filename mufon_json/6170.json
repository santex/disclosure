{"Longitude":"-119.231393","Region":"California","City":"Bridgeport","Summary":"A very large, silent, silvery object flew slowly by the crest of the Sierras. No sound was made and we could hear a very high jet and an airplane in the distant but thi thing made no noise as it glided low and slow over this point near the Sonora Pass.","divs":["sighting detailsi have camped out around this area for the past thiry years and have done numerous extended backpacking trips----as high as three weeks at a time.i have seen many things i cannot explain other than it was an un identified flying object. but always at night. the fishing has been so good for years in this place that a friend of mine has made this quite the gathering spot for us men who never grew up. last year, there was at the height, 85 of us camped out in a canyon 4 miles north of the town of bridgeport, california.just over the hill from hawthorne, nevada. about twelve years ago, our campsite then was in a canyon along the little walker river. just one canyon south of the marine camp and we were \"buzzed\" by them on their night manuever's with their blacked out and relatively quite helicopters. i have seen an entire mountain range glow from two bright objects that did things no helicopter could and then flew out towards space and dissapeared at an incredible speed without making a sound. on a beautiful, clear, calm day a group of about 15 of us did our traditional hike to an alpine lake (emma lake)on the eastern crest of the sierra.three of the next generation (one an ex-marine)had brought snowshoes and snowboards and hiked to the top of emma peak (3208 m) and those still at the lake were just fishing and following their progress when this absolutley huge thing came into view from behind emma peak and glided accross the distant horizon. i, like an idiot, had a camera around my neck but instead of taking a picture of it, all i did was question the two guys right next to me what they thought it was. i yelled at the group accross from us who had their backs to this, to look up and tell me what they thought it was.they were too close to the steep hillside and could not see anything. the guy on my right said he had binoculars in his backpack and i started digging through it while still questioning these two guys if they heard anything and what they thought they were looking at. the guy on my left said he heard a plane and i pointed at the plane flying 4 miles just east of us and said yeah you hear that plane but what about that thing up there? the first thing i dug out was his camera and got it out of the case only to see it was not the binocs and by the time i got his binocs, i saw this thing for only long enough to say it was not like any blimp i have ever seen. and it slowly drifted behind the mountains going to the crest of the sierras. the total to travel this approximately mile long horizon visible through the saddle was just about 2 1\\2 minutes. just a stroll in the park. from the beginning of the sighting until it dissappeared. how or if it crossed over the sierras is beyond me. by the size of the trees (thirty feet tall) in the saddle that you could see this object through, our best guesstimation of the size of this would be well over 300 feet long. (two trees at it's width) at one time, it nearlly filled half the sky seen through the saddle in the mountain. it was shaped more like a cigar than a blimp and flying on a slight tilt in the direction it was headed. it could have been a disc seen only on it's edge. but it was not like any blimp i have ever seen. and it had to be just skimming the mountains.barely clearing the range. only a fool flies that low in the sierras and during the same time a high flying eastern bound jet (30,000 feet?) could be heard as well as the single engine plane flying around 10,000 feet going north to south following us highway 395. between the mountain ranges. this thing was travelling west bound right up the little walker river canyon not more than a mile away from us and not making a sound. there were no windows. no bottom carriage. no rear stabilizers.no markings. it appeared to have a stubby small wing-like object in the middle. and by small, this is relative as it would have been huge, as big as a single engine plane would not this object itself been so big. the wing was visible easily with the binoculars. no exhaust. no lights blinking. no red on the right returning. it just kind of shimmered.like glowing mercury. kind of like the objects (toys) you could hold up to a light source and they glowed. the three who saw this could not say what we saw this day."],"Date of the Event":"06/15/2006 11:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-01152007-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6170.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6170.html"],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.255704,+-119.231393(6170)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6170) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/15/2006 11:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"38.255704","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bridgeport","There were no other sightings in Bridgeport on or around June 15th 2006"],"Case Number":"6170"}
