Looking north I noticed a small white object floating and moving very slowly away apparently near but under the rain clouds in the area. Object appeared the size of a printed period held at arms length, quite small. Distance might have been a few miles and altitude a few thousand feet above the ground. I was watching the rain clouds and happened to see the object. Object could have been a balloon blowing horozantally instead of ascending. Feelings were curiosity. Object seened completely non threatening. Object moved slowly away and I lost sight due to trees low on the horizion."],"Log Number":"US-05282007-0006"}
