{"City":"Beaver Falls","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["sighting detailswe got out of our car and were heading into the house. i saw a bright object above the tree line off far in the distance. it was a bright white light, it did not seem to flicker or change. i'm not sure of the directions, but from where we were standing, it was travelling left to right in my field of vision. it wasn't going extremely fast, but seemed faster than a normal plane. i didn't think that it was a normal plane, because there were no red\\green lights. about 2 minutes later, an actual plane, following the same path as the object appeared from the same location we first saw the object. this plane had the red\\green lights that i would expect from a standard plane. both the plane and the object were visible for another minute or so. the object then left our field of vision (to our right), with the plane still following the path the object took."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"14746","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Beaver Falls","There were no other sightings in Beaver Falls on or around October 17th 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Date of the Event":"10/17/2008 07:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.31363","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-01042009-0023","Summary":"Bright object above horizon travelling, followed by plane/jet.","Latitude":"40.75572","Date Submitted":"10/17/2008 07:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.75572,+-80.31363(14746)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14746) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14746.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14746.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City"}
