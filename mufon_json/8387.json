{"divs":["sighting detailsthe year was 1978. i was 16, and, i was the leader of my jrotc class and we were on bivuoac with other jrotc groups from our region. there were three one-hundred man tents as i recall. the tent poles for one of the tents were left behind, therefore, some groups had to sleep uncovered. i was in such a group, and, it was my duty to call taps for our tent. our tent was laid out on the ground and the rotc members\\students took up places in a somewhat organized fashion. lights-out\\taps was at ten p.m. and soon everyone was either in the tents or, as in my groups case, on top of the tent in their sleeping bags and being relatively quite. i looked over my charges to ensure compliance, and prepared my self to go to sleep. while i was lying in my sleeping bag, i was looking up at the stars and remember them to be vast and bright and breathtaking. (i lived in the city, campbell - a suburb of san jose, and though one can see stars at night, this experience was comparable to being in the mountains with little or no city light obstructing the beauty.) very soon after i as staring at a huge, and i mean huge ufo hovering silently overhead. the was no commotion around me, no other individuals 'responding' or 'gasping' or anything such to alert me that i was not the only individual to be seeing this thing. i lay there quiet and awe-inspired. the object (from my vantage point) was round, like a large disc. there were orange lights on the perimeter, small in nature, and on the underside, there were large lights (maybe five or six and again, orange in color) in the shape of bars. i was reminded of the simon says game where players have to depress colored bars in a sequence in response to a pattern set by the machine. the player who could follow the sequence without missing a 'note' would move on to the next round. anyway, this thing hovered there above us in complete quiet. i tried hard to focus my hearing to above me, searching for traces of any aircraft sounds. no sounds were emitted from this object. the object seemed to be only a stone's throw above us, and had it been on the ground, i estimate that it's size would have engulfed the three tents combined. i don't remember how long i stared at this thing before it started moving to the north. there were no indications of its intentions to move. no flashes of light or other significant mechanical notifications that the object was going to move. i was lying down with my head facing west and i followed the crafts movement to the north by first moving only my eyes, but soon i had to move my head as it traveled further and further toward the mountians to the north. my internal compass may be off - i do not know if there are mountains to the north or to the east of fort ord. notwithstanding, i turned my head to the left to follow the object into the distance. as i was watching the craft become smaller and smaller as it approached the 'horizon', i noticed stars moving far, far off in the sky, and i at first assumed a meteor shower or shooting stars. soon however i noticed a pattern to the 'stars' movements and took more concern over them. the initial craft was now becoming a bright star as the others, and when it reached the mountains (or beyond) it 'met up' with the other stars\\lights\\crafts and fell into formation. here, obviously, one needs further description of the other stars\\crafts. there were five other crafts that i witnessed. three came from the western sky and two came from the eastern sky. they, all five of them, seemed to 'dance' in a formation. this dance lasted mabye half a minute, maybe more. what picqued my interest further, was that they appeared to be in a formation much like the thunderbirds would do when i went to air shows in tampa, florida. not the same formations, mind you, but the same idea. i recongized this because the two on the right were mirroring the three on the left, but, the two on the right were missing a 'third'. but for that missing third, the formations were identical - left and right\\west and east. then, as the first observed craft neared, the five stopped and hung in the sky, and, when the first craft met up with them, it took its place in position with the two from the east and then, all six went into a dance, and after just a few seconds, if that long, they all sped away on different paths, in a pattern much like we depict the rays of sunshine - and furthermore, they sped away at a speed that defies measurement. i have no reference to relate the speed to. upon their exit, i let out a moan or a whoa, or something of that nature in awe of what i had just spent a good part of time witnessing. to my astonhishment, another student\\memeber rotc comrade let out a moan\\groan\\sigh at the very same moment. we were orientated in such a way that our heads could have touched and our feet at opposite ends. much like the pages in a book and our heads situated at the spine. we both got up on our elbows and turned to face each other and, i don't remember the exact words, but we inquired of each other, ever-so-quietly if they have just seen....yeah, you too? yeah. i don't recall ever using the words ufo, or spacecraft or anything like that. in fact, we did not make much of a fuss about it verbally for whatever reason. i can say though, that i was not comfortable admitting this\\reporting this to anyone for fear of ridicule and the fact that the other kid that witness these same events was a class clown and had i the power, i would have kicked him out of the class long ago, because i took the class seriously and with great respect and he, on the other hand, took nothing about the class seriously. it was merely a way out of pe. we never discussed this experience with each other, and to my knowledge he has only discussed this with a very small group of people that we know. in fact, i only learned about his discussing the experience some twenty years later when i was married because i related the experience to my wife and to her astonishment, it was very similar to the experience he told her years and years earlier. i have never reported this incident, nor have i looked up anything regarding fort ord and ufos or any connection thereto. if such a report exists, i have no knowledge of it."],"trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Monterey","There were no other sightings in Monterey on or around October 10th 1978"],"Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Monterey","Case Number":"8387","Summary":"Fort Ord Bivuoac with JROTC 1978","Latitude":"36.603718","Date of the Event":"10/10/1978 10:05 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/10/1978 10:05 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11172007-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.603718,+-121.888876(8387)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8387) map </A>","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-121.888876","Object Shape":"Disc","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8387.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8387.html"],"Tags":"City","Region":"California"}
