The movie didn���t keep my interest and I began to look at the stars as it was a very clear night. While looking up toward the NW, right below the Big Dipper I saw 3 lights in a perfect triangle moving at speeds much higher than an airplane would go. I thought they might be meteors and they seemed to have the speed that meteors have. The middle light (forming the point at the lead in the direction of travel) was the brightest or biggest. I couldn���t tell which. I didn���t see anything but the lights. There was no streak like you would see with a meteor. The lights just appeared and traveled a little ways then they blinked out. They were traveling WNW."],"Tags":"City"}
