I was looking at the stars like i usually do when i decide to follow a plane thats heading north and then my eye catches an object moving south east. At first i thought it was a falling star until i pointed it out and we all agreed that it was moving too slow to be anything like that. So we kicked around the notion that it could be a high altitude jet or a satelite...that was debunked by what happened shortly after. While saying it was way too high to be a plane and moving at that speed at that altitude youd die from the gforce AND ON A CLEAR NIGHT WITH NO CLOUDS i simply vanished....or changed direction to leave the atmoshere so fast my naked eye couldnt detect it. I am a very rational person and so are my friends we believe in ET life and do not let our human emotions and thoughts get too wrapped up without looking at the FACTS...there is something happening and only certain people on a certain frequency in life will be able to pick up on it. If you come investigate i promise you wont be disappointed.
