As I was driving around the on-ramp from Manchester trafficway to I-70 Westbound I noticed a VERY large craft in the sky over 435 & I-70 intersection. There were blinking white lights blinking simultaneously on what seemed to be the outer edge. I was going to pull over and take a video of it but I would have been late for work so I just kept driving away from the object watching it in my rear view mirror until it was out of sight. The object seemed to be hovering periodically then moving at a slow rate and very low altitude. I called my wife and told her about what I saw and said, just wait, you will see this on the news pretty soon and voila, here are all of these people describing the same thing and Fox 4 news is going to report \"strange lights in East Kansas city area\" tonight!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.104646","Date Submitted":"10/06/2011 10:02 UTC","Longitude":"-94.570737","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 9 other sightings in Kansas City on or around October 4th 2011"],"Summary":"I-70 and Manchester Trafficway","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.104646,+-94.570737(32403)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32403) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","City":"Kansas City","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 08:06 UTC","Region":"Missouri","Case Number":"32403","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32403.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32403.html"]}
