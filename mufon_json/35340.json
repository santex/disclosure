I noticed an object traveling at a very high rate of speed... it caught my interest because of its lighting was bright and constant... It didn't dissipate or disappear like a shooting star would have done. Although there is an airport in the area, when airplanes begin their dissent their speed slows down considerably, this did not happen at all... the object travelled across the sky with what seemed to be a small trail. The object was shaped like a white cigar with a brown band around the middle. It was a clear morning, star lit and no clouds at all in the sky. The object travelled well above the tree line as far as I could see... The object is unexplainable...."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/29/2012 07:54 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
