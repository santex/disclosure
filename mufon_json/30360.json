(Not even the sound of cutting air at the speed it was traveling) At the time about 1139PM EASTER STANDARD TIME as it traveled over my house at aprox. 500mph I had 15 seconds of view time and my son had about 8 seconds of view time. We saw the craft so well we could identify a single power source attached to the 3 cylindrical housings containing 7 vents for directional propulsion venting blue flames or blue heat giving the appearance of 3 lights. Possibly a plasma engine? However I have no explination how something of such mass could maintain current speed, altitude and silence."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"30360","City":"Sidney"}
