I'd been sitting on my terrace at my country house, when I noticed a strange flying object above. This attracted my attention because it was flaming and firstly I thought that it was a burning detail part of a plane and maybe something had happened. But the flaming object had been flying in a straight trajectory. After that I called my friends and parents and it had changed trajectory slightly to the left and started to fly away ahead and up and we could make out that it was one object looked like it was made up of three flaming balls (one big and one small one on the each side). That was very interesting to watch and after I became very interested to know what it was. I've made a picture to try and illustrate what I saw."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"Russian Federation","Date of the Event":"07/09/2011 10:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
