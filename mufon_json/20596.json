We traveled east from Rogers AR on highway 12 into Madison county then took highway 23 north into Eureka Springs AR. Enroute to Eureka and on the return trip my wife snapped several pictures of the clouds as it was a partly cloudy day. Upon returning home we downloaded the digital photos to our computer and it was then we noticed the object in the sky. Using photo processing software I cut the area out containing the object and made a second photo and tried to enhance it with the software. The enhanced photo contains an enlargement of the object that is pasted into the lower right corner. I am including with this report both the original and enhanced photos.
