The object was teardrop shape and looked as though it was on fire with something trailing beneath it. There was no noise apparent. It followed an arcing direction and I lost sight of it after approx. 2 mins. over the horizon. It appeared to be fairly large as it was very visible in the sky and looked very high up. I called my husband to come and see it as I was not sure what it was and wanted his opinion. He saw it very visibly and was not sure what we were looking at - whether it was a weather balloon, plane on fire or something else."],"Object Shape":"Teardrop","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/07/2012 12:43 UTC","Log Number":"US-07072012-0004","Summary":"Red glowing object in sky over Virginia Beach Va","Latitude":"36.854036","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40429.html"],"Case Number":"40429","City":"Virginia Beach","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.854036,+-75.970235(40429)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40429) map </A>","Longitude":"-75.970235"}
