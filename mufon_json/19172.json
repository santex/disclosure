{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Seoul","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis photo was taken at one of the temple in Seoul,Korea. It was around 1pm and several shot was taken around this statue. But only it apprear only on this shot.(other shot was taken in about 15seconds before and after) Size of the statue is about 23meters frome the ground. Lens I used to take this picture was Samsung 16-45mm for pentax k20d. (pls refer exif data) When I saw at first time after shot was taken(after download the pictures to my computer at home), I suspected it as a kind of insect(moth or others)but comparing the size of the statue, it is way bigger than any kind of insects. Actually if it was a moth or any kind of insect, it is impossible to verify with the size appeared on the photo cosidering the distanse from where I took the photo. When I took this photo, there were no one but me around this budda statue. I don't know whether this is a kind of UFO or anything like that but it is very odd and I want to know what it is. When I took next shot after this picture(about 15-20sec later), it was gone.
