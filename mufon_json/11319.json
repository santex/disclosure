It was so bright it drew my attention right to it. It was moving faster then any air plain I have ever seen. About half way across the sky it just stop and hung there about 15 to 20 seconds. Then it just was not there. I have seen f4 phantoms traveling at supersonic speeds and this was moving more then twice that speed. It made no sound, I was waiting for the sound to catch up and waited for the sonic boom, it never happened. I do not know how anything can be moving that fast and then just stop. Points: 1. working on our farm 2. it was a bright as a arc welder, white light not blue 3. a missile or military jet 4. thin silver tube shape 5. just sat there on my tractor and watched it, my feeling was you don't see that every day. 6. it just disappeared on its own while I was looking right at it."],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"40.186203","Log Number":"US-06262008-0012","Region":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.186203,+-84.283344(11319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11319) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"11319","City":"Demming","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/24/2008 01:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.283344","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11319.html"],"Summary":"Saw fast moving object suddenly stop and then disappeared."}
