Initially couldnt identify as meteor? Or what? Watched it cross the horizon at abt airline cruising altitude from Northern most horizon to Southern most horizon. As the 4 adults discussed it for 5 minutes, we then noticed a second large orange orb following the exact same trajectory from N to S. very obviously not a plane, comet, meteor, helicopter, etc. No sound, no trails, moving very distinctly along the same paths."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 10:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-07082013-0021","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48813.html"],"Latitude":"35.952285","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nolensville","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
