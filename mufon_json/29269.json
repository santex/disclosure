He lives on Malden just north of Wilson in Chicago. Four of us were there and someone thought it looked like a balloon. This seemed inconsistent as to the way it was traveling, in my opinion. The ���balloon��� was approx 100 ��� 150 yards above our heads traveling due north in a straight and steady pace. It was traveling approx 20-30 mph. I would say it resembled a Chinese lantern in terms of the glowing, soft light. It appeared smooth in texture. I watched it travel until I couldn���t see it anymore and when I was losing sight of it the sky had a glitter effect where I thought the object should have been in the distance. I was very impressed and curious about the sighting, whereas my friends just sort of dismissed the event. (!!)"]}
