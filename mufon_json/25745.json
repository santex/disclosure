As fast or faster than a satellite. this was not a plane. I lost sight of the object when it just disappeared in mid air 4 inches above the tree line. it happened an hour ago, as im typing two all black military helicopters came flying in the same flight path but in the opposite direction. prob a coincidence but interesting."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.015786,+-75.698534(25745)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25745) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10082010-0012","Date of the Event":"10/08/2010 02:30 UTC","Latitude":"40.015786","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
