It's size was about as big as a flying crow. First it looked like a bended stick to me, that was steadily flying with its wide part facing the direction it was going. It was still pretty dark outside so i didnt see any more details other then the orange glow. very strange. This is my 3rd sighting from the window, but I was surprised because I've never heard of flying sticks. It's usually orange orbs seems like."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.60933,+-122.325381(25785)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25785) map </A>","Tags":"City","Summary":"A bright orange glowing stick/boomerang flew by window in the morning about 10-15 feel away from me.","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There was one other sighting in Seattle on or around October 6th 2010"],"Longitude":"-122.325381","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25785.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25785.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/06/2010 06:40 UTC","City":"Seattle","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"25785","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Latitude":"47.60933","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/10/2010 11:45 UTC"}
