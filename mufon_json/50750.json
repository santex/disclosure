Then once the front light passed me I saw another light on my far right and another one slightly to my left going over me. I noticed from the base of the lights that the craft was a flat black and not making any noise. Also that the craft was going about 60-80 miles an hour 90 east over the tree tops. I first thought it was a Stealth Bomber but because it was so low and made no noise or that it could even fly at that low of speeds is crazy. I'm just mad that I didn't just pull over a chased the thing and take pictures. I'm just reporting this just incase anybody else saw the same thing that night."],"City":"New York","Date of the Event":"09/09/2013 01:50 UTC"}
