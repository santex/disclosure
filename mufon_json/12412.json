I live directly under the approach path to Logan Airport (east of my location) in central mass (templeton, ma). they were just pure white orbs and they were NOT convention aircraft in any way. this is my first EVER sighting of an aerial anomoly. I took no photos of the sighting."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Sphere","Date Submitted":"09/07/2008 04:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12412.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12412.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Date of the Event":"09/07/2008 04:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Massachusetts","Summary":"saw white orbs in formation + saw orb split into two","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Other"}
