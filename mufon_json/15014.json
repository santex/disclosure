During 20 minutes of observation moved about 5 degrees from west south west to a more westerly point, before disappearing below a line of hills. I have previously observed such an occurance in that direction but knowing there are no habitations in that area for more than 10 miles I am confident that they are not in anyway earth bound."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15014.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15014.html"],"Summary":"Sphere - bright light with red lights at bottom of halo.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.793063,+-105.312209(15014)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15014) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Montana","Longitude":"-105.312209","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"01/19/2009 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"46.793063","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Terry","There were no other sightings in Terry on or around January 19th 2009"],"City":"Terry","Case Number":"15014","Date Submitted":"01/19/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01202009-0009","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City"}
