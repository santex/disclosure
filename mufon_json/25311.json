I was traveling down Route 309 towards Wilkes-Barre (northbound) and noticed the sky was clear and blue. As I began to approach my exit, I saw what I thought was a plane flying over the area. I was on a path where planes from our local airport would pass. AS I got closer, I thought maybe it was a blimp. But as I got even closer it looked block like. It was just sitting there. I think the craft was small no more than 10-15 in length. the craft was box shape and was rectangular on the side and square on the front. The craft was basically black with white edges. I believe I was about a mile or two away. There were not too many people in the highway and I came up to a red light. I turned onto the exit and noticed my view changed. I was looking into the craft and saw two white lights. (it reminded me of landing lights on a plane.) the craft did not have wings, and it wasn���t a helicopter. I lost sight of the craft when I turned off the highway. I did look for a safe place to pull over to take a picture but I was not able to do so. I am a frequent satellite watcher. I have seen several UFOs in the past."],"Date Submitted":"09/05/2010 11:40 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.21242,+-75.893066(25311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25311) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25311.html"],"City":"Ashley","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.893066"}
