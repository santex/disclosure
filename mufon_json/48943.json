We were walking to our cars in the busy parking lot and I observed a weird orange orb. I thought it was a meteor traveling but it lasted to long about a minute for it to be a shooting star or meteor. It was traveling fast. Faster than an airplane but slower than a meteor. It was really high up in the cloudless sky. I said look whats that and my mom observed it also. We just stood there and looked at it for about a minute. Then it just dispeared into the sky. It was traveling upwards at an angle it seemed to dispear into the atmosphere in a second."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Rancho Cucamonga","There were no other sightings in Rancho Cucamonga on or around July 12th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07142013-0019","Summary":"Glowing orange orb traveling upwards and then disapears in the cloudless night.","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.115289,+-117.590838(48943)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48943) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle"}
