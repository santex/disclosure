Instead, Ithought I would stay awake untill my parents went to bed. I noticed it was thereby feeling the presence of an unknown object. Then a strange whirring sound. Ilooked out of my bedroom window to see a bright light in the sky emmitting astrange cloud or mist. Then the large light flashed and dissapeared and in itsplace, 5 or 6 smaller UFOs appeared in its place and started dancing information.Me, my brother and sister witnessed this event after I woke them up.After about two hours of watching this, I went to notify my parents but theydidnt believe me and when I returned to my room, the objects had vanished aswell. I was astonished and scared stiff when I saw these objects but yet I wasstrangely compelled to keep watching. I was also very excited. While I waswatching, my head started to ache and I felt dizzy. After, when I went to sleep,I kept recalling the event in my dreams only I was much closer to the objects."]}
