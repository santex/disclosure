Three helicopters in a triangle formation passed overhead in a southwesterly heading. At first as they began to pass over I noticed that the trailing helicopter was quite some distance from the front two. Then, as they began to pass over I could see that the void between the leading helicopters was not empty at all; there was a black briangle shaped craft without any lights flying between the leading and trailing helicopters. We were only able to see the craft because it was darker than the slight overcast we had that night. I am absolutely convinced that the helicopters were \"escorting\" this craft for some unknown reason."],"Longitude":"-86.576887","Summary":"Witnesses saw triangle accompanied by helicopters","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"03/11/2006 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05072006-0005","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.523121","Tags":"City","trends":[],"Region":"Tennessee","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.523121,+-86.576887(4754)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4754) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4754.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4754.html"],"Case Number":"4754"}
