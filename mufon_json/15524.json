I tried to wake up my husband and he would not get up. This thing looked like it flew even lower and was coming down the street towards towards my house. I was too scared to get up so I layed there and hoped it was gone. It had to be close because light filtered into my room. At first I thought it was a helicopter but there was no noise and it was way to bright with a bluish light. I fell asleep right after that I think and then I woke up again at about 4:30 and things seemed normal so I went to the bathroom. What was it? Anyone else see it?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15524.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-02162009-0017","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.78076","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Pittston","There was one other sighting in Pittston on or around January 1st 2009"],"Country":"United States","City":"Pittston","Summary":"i woke up and saw a large,extremely bright flying object through my bedroom window.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.329663,+-75.78076(15524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15524) map </A>","Latitude":"41.329663","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"01/01/2009 03:15 UTC","Case Number":"15524","Object Shape":"Oval","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
