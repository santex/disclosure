Was coming inside caught a view of red lights in the shape of a triangle. Thought how is that plain flying like that? More like floating ,moving slowly, while keeping triangular shape. Seemed to turn slightly, slowly, changing shape. Then returning to triangle shape. Seemed to descend a little, noticeable cloudy substance appeared underneath which cast a shadow of what seemed to be a mass. Thought what new stuff is the air force testing these days? Cool.
