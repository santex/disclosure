I looked up and wax immediately intrigued by a larger triangle formation approximately 300 feet above ground. The lights (three of them) were bluish-white and had a strange glow to them. I knew immediately they were not stars ANC they were definitely not an air plane. There was no sound coming from the object at all. After staring in awe for approximately 2 minutes one by one the lights disappeared."],"Date Submitted":"01/22/2012 02:14 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-122.769585","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Santa Rosa","Summary":"Three lights in a triangle formation appeared and then one by one the lights disappeared.","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Latitude":"38.466526","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"12/31/2011 12:00 UTC"}
