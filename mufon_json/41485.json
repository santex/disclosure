{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailson 08\\05\\12, at approximately 2110 hrs., my son and i observed a bright object moving through the sky from our living room window. we walked out onto our deck and could see a large round white light traveling northeast over the hopland mountains(town of hopland). the object was much brighter than any stars or planes in the area and it appeared to be very high up. it made no sounds as it traveled. through high powered binoculars we watched it continue over clear lake, until it disappeared behind bartlett springs mt.(town of lucerne). it never deviated from it's path. it was a clear night, with no wind and i estimate it took it about 4 or 5 minutes to cross the horizon. the object was much brighter and bigger than any satellite i have ever seen. it's possible it was a space station?"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"39.058853","Date Submitted":"08/06/2012 08:28 UTC","Summary":"Bright whit orb","Date of the Event":"08/05/2012 09:10 UTC","Case Number":"41485","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-08062012-0018","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Lakeport","There were no other sightings in Lakeport on or around August 5th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.058853,+-122.911186(41485)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41485) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lakeport","Longitude":"-122.911186","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41485.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41485.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
