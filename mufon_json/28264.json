I just happened to look up into the sky, as I often do to watch the stars and the occasional jet inbound to Offut Airforce Base or Epply Airfield. Within a couple of seconds of looking into the sky, I say the triangle shapped object. It was moving fairly slowly and approx. 500 ft to maybe 1,000 in the air. I relate the height to the height of the large power poles with have in the park area behind our house. There was NO noise associated with this object! Also, there was a reddish-orange hue that seemed to trace the outline of the object. I also could faintly make out some rough yet unknown marking on the bottom of the object. There were no blinking lights. There was just the hue to it. I did started to tell my wife to look..look at that...what is that? She kept saying...what...what? I would point into the sky but by the time she walked down the stairs and onto the patio, the object had passed far enough north that the object was behind the roof line of our house. That oddest thing was the NO noise and hue of the object. No blinking lights. Any plane flying that low would be moving much...much faster that this object was. The movement was very smooth and in a straight line from south to north."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28264.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28264.html"],"Longitude":"-95.993188","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.260463","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"03/16/2011 08:25 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
