{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis occurred just outside Gulf Breeze, FL at what was once Camp Big heart, nowGulf Islands Natl. Seashore (navel Live Oak). 3 of us on a Boy Scout camp-outhad wandered off around midnight to go sit on a sand dune and smoke cigarettes. We had been there a while when we noticed the object slowly moving from east towest over the intercoastal waterway. It traveled very slowly -less than 10 mph. We were all transfixed on the object until it pulled even with us, whereupon weall freaked out and ran back to camp. This object looked exactly like theobject later reported in the infamous Gulf Breeze sightings."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Gulf Breeze early seventies","Longitude":"-87.161197","City":"Gulf Breeze","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Date Submitted":"11/30/1969 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.358184,+-87.161197(1038)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1038) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Gulf Breeze","There were no other sightings in Gulf Breeze on or around November 30th 1969"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1038.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1038.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1038.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/30/1969 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.358184","Case Number":"1038","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
