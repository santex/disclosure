I took 5 minutes of video showing light trails and objects above horizon. I re-set cam in same location and position shortly after sunrise shooting another 5 minute clip. I re-set cam in same position approximately 9:30, for contrasting shot of earlier sightings, shooting 3 minutes followed by another 3 minute clip after changing the sharpness of the video on cam's internal adjustments, trying to get a better resolution. In each of the videos, I see what I had noticed as lights and shapes rising from the horizon between the buildings, center of frame. Lights and objects were visible with the naked eye as well as the camera, moving up, circling, then departing at high speed to the west for the most part; some departing to the east or south.
