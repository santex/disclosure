I thought it was the top of a very high antenna until I got close. I parked the car and stared at it for about 15 minutes. No noise, movement, smoke etc. came from it. I got tired og waiting and got in the car and began driving again. I drove about 1,000 feet and stopped the car again because I couldn���t leave without looking some more at the light. When I stopped a second time after about 5 minutes the light began to descend towards the first low foot hills at the rear of the National Guard Base. The light made no noise, no smoke no side to side movements just a slow decent as if it were on a cable. When it reached the first foot hills a few miles away, I could see the trees and land clearly illuminated by the sphere of light. It descended behind the foothills and disappeared. Iam a security manager for a multinational company, an ex 1st lieutenant in the Army and in the National Guard and have seen all types of planes and helicopters, both day and night. I have never seen something like that before. In Ponce my mother, father and aunt along with others close to the seashore at night saw a flying disc on its side like a wheel. A friend also in Ponce at about 3am along with her adopted son saw two balls of light unite with a third ball of light and then the one light flew off."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"07/22/2004 11:30 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Salinas","There were no other sightings in Salinas on or around July 22nd 2004"],"Region":"California","Case Number":"6519","Tags":"City","Summary":"saw a bright light above a national guard military base","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6519.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6519.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"36.677737","Longitude":"-121.655501","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Log Number":"PR-03072007-0008"}
