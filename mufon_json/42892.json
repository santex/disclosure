It was blinking different colors like a satellite but to low in sky, and wrong colors for a plain. I went inside got my camera and a laser pointer, and went back out.This was not the first time i had seen this (light). It was closer to me then and i started filming it,it was changing colors at that time.(first video). I went to check my camera to c if i could get a better setting to tape with.decided to hell with that and just tape. Which is when it went from changing colors to a solid white light. IT seemed to float through the sky that's how slow it was moving. But didn't make a sound. the noise on the video ( the clicking)is the sound of the laser pointer. The brightness changed as it headed east. then it got duller and duller. even though the camera did not pick it up, I could still see it and kept pointing and clicking the laser at it. It got to a point that it just fazed out. Like it dimmed the light till it was out, not becouse it was far away. I got pissed off because i didn't have a better camera to tape with. the date on the videos is wrong, i have never set the date- time mode. Unlike the first report i made to mufon ( which turns out was Venus ) this didn't return every night for weeks. phone # only good after first of oct."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-91.762967","Summary":"flashing light ,like a satellite ,that changed to a white light","Case Number":"42892","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Spooner","There were no other sightings in Spooner on or around September 20th 2011"],"Latitude":"45.870687","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/29/2012 12:31 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:00:58"}
