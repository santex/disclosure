One of the objects was smaller than the other. The two objects always stayed fairly close to one another."],"Date Submitted":"03/11/2012 12:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36379.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36379.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.010071,+-85.751767(36379)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36379) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"03/10/2012 10:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.751767","Case Number":"36379","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pendleton","There were 2 other sightings in Pendleton on or around March 10th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
