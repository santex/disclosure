I noticed it at 6 Mile and Sheldon and could still see it at 6 Mile and Ridge Rd to the southeast. At first I thought it was a bright star, then I noticed it was dipping down in the sky. It changed in color from blue to violet to green to red. It moved about the sky like a fruit fly in a random pattern though staying in a small area of the sky, dipping below the horizon then coming back up. The brightness varied, changing from very bright to invisible. I pulled over to watch the light, and after rolling down my window, I did not notice any sound though it seemed quite far away. The light disappeared below the horizon. About an hour later, I noticed the light was back and behaving the same as before. I watched it slowly dip below the horizon again and didn't notice it any further. The clouds rolled in."],"Summary":"While driving, saw colored light, changed color, randomly moving about the south sky","Log Number":"US-03242013-0003","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Plymouth Township","There were no other sightings in Plymouth Township on or around March 23rd 2013"],"City":"Plymouth Township","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46374.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46374.html"],"Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"46374","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/24/2013 07:58 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.380043,+-83.507718(46374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46374) map </A>"}
