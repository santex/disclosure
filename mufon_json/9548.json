{"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.754755","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"very slow moving object flying low with no noise at all","Region":"Texas","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were outside because of the nice weather we were having just talking and looking at the sky when my wife noticed a very slow moving light coming towards us from the southwest traveling northwest. As it approached us we noticed it made no noise at all. It passed directly over our heads at approximately 1000 to 1500 hundred feet. Shortly after it passed over our heads the object came to a complete stop. Then the light went out and then we noticed a red glow or light underneath it go out nearly simutaneously. We never seen or heard anything else from it as we stood for at least 10 minutes just kind of freaking out wondering what the hell we had just witnessed. But I invite you or anyone from MUFON to come to Runaway Bay and take a look at the sky here at night because we are seeing a lot of very strange things in the sky and would love to share it with you to prove this place is a hotbed for unexplained lights and I believe are UFOs."],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9548.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9548.html"],"Latitude":"33.210116","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02122008-0002","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.210116,+-97.754755(9548)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9548) map </A>","City":"Bridgeport","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bridgeport","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"01/17/2008 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"9548","Date Submitted":"01/17/2008 07:30 UTC"}
