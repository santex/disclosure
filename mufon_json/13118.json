Hamilton area. It first appeared as a long cigar shaped object then as I kept watching it changed into a ball of light pinpoint then it faded from view. This all happened in the course of 3 minutes from 11:20 am to 11:23 am. I tried to see other motorists also saw it but was not sure if others had seen it as well. This is the first time that I have ever seen something like this. When it was it's long cigar shape it was a whitish grey then turned into a ball that looked like a star in the mid morning sky.It wasn't spectacular looking but it was definitely not a vapor trail of an airplane from what I could tell. I don't know what it was but I am curious if anyone else saw it.
