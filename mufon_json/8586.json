A very large low flying craft (perhaps 80 feet long) containing many different colored lights and producing a very odd mechanical whooshing sound suddenly appeared from the left side of their field of vision and slowly hovered around the perimeter of the house in a straight line. They \"all\" felt as if they were being observed. They all felt a sensation of fear when they realized the object was not an airplane. They had no desire to observe where the object was heading after it left their field of vision. (They were all scared) They reported no wings on the low flying craft that was below the tree line at the rear of the home. They never heard or saw anything like it before."],"Case Number":"8586","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Dome","Longitude":"-74.70405","Region":"New Jersey","City":"Upper","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Upper","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"12/03/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12102007-0001"}
