(7:30 pm 2-1-12) Saw one object in the east. ( we were 9 miles from Ocean but it seemed that object was over the water). It was stationary, at about 80 degree angle....but appeared to be dancing, changing shape, then regrouping. Kept watching silently. Realized it was not a blimp or helicopter. Looked to my left, and saw another similar or possibly the same configuration over the North County Airport. Same actiivity......Thought we saw another color...looked like a ribbon on the end of a wand....dancers use....making a sideway figure eight...but then it became one \"star\" again. Called NC airport when we arrived home...got recording. It closes at dark. Only used by small planes and helicopters. Hesitated calling Sheriff, or newspaper. They deny everything anyway."],"Longitude":"-80.230394","Case Number":"35411","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.879152,+-80.230394(35411)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35411) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02022012-0008","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in West Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in West Palm Beach on or around February 1st 2012"],"City":"West Palm Beach","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"02/01/2012 07:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
