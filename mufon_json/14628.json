With a disposable camera I never visually seen anything. But last week when I was going through my photo DVD I found a picture of an object over Chicago. The uploaded picture is a raw unedited photo. Not much to look at, just looks like a line with an orb below it. The mark on the left side of the photo is a defect in the lens. I've uploaded two pictures taken seconds apart both out the same window at different angles. I can not elaborate on this sighting as I did not physically see this object. First frame is the one with the object, second frame it is gone. Not much distance between the two."],"Disposition":"Hoax","Region":"Illinois","Case Number":"14628"}
