{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was making a furniture delivery for my work around 3 p.m. on Friday, the 28th of May, 2010. I was in the delivery truck as the passenger, heading south on I-15 to the town of New Harmony, Utah. About 12 to 14 miles south of Cedar City I was glancing around towards the mountains to my left hand side, and a good distance above the mountain tops I noticed what first appeared to be a small plane. It was hard to get a good look at the shape and size because it was a metallic color and there wasn���t a cloud in the sky to block the sun, which caused a glare off of the object. I watched it for some time without saying anything to the driver, thinking it was just an ordinary plane. Over the course of time I watched it, it didn���t seem to make much movement or gain any distance towards or away from us, aside from a few very small side to side type motions. Something about it made me keep staring for a while but I still never said anything to the driver of the vehicle. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that we were coming up on some traffic, so I looked a head for no more than 3 seconds, then turned back to look at the object again but it was completely gone. Where the object was in relation to its surroundings, there was nowhere it could have gone to escape my line of sight within just a few seconds. It wasn���t until then that I felt alarmed enough to say anything to my co-worker, who didn���t think much of the situation. About 30 to 45 minutes after the sighting we were headed back north to Cedar City and spotted a number of dark and unmarked vehicles wit US Government license plates, as well as a fairly low flying military plane with some large attatchment on the bottom of the plane that looked like some type of radar or satelite device."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"24363","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Cedar City","There were no other sightings in Cedar City on or around May 28th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/28/2010 03:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/08/2010 09:31 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.49065,+-113.215949(24363)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24363) map </A>","Country":"United States","Region":"Utah","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07082010-0021","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24363.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24363.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Cedar City","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-113.215949","Summary":"Strange flying object over nearby mountains, it didn't appear to be moving.
