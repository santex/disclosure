When we approached Cambridge on the 401 I saw a large bright object low on the horizon to my left. I thought nothing of it for a while until I began to get closer to it near Highway 6, near Guelph. It was a large bright light pulsating just above the horizon. I watched it for a while and realized it was not moving in any direction, only getting brighter. A second light appeared parallel to the first object but not as bright. By this point everyone in the car has noticed the two lights and keep a steady eye on it. I grew up in the area and have taken this route many time so I ruled out any kind of tower. The second light disappeared after about 2 minutes. We continued to watch the light for another 15 minutes, getting cut off by tall tree lines and hills for a few moments. My friend in the back had eyes on it when it finally dimmed down to a deep red and disappeared completely. We managed to watch this light for around 30 minutes without any kind of movement."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.81733","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Large Pulsating Orb Outside of Toronto","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.81733,+-79.334061(33526)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33526) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
