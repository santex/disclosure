{"divs":["sighting detailsprior to january 31, 2009 i had a healthy interest in ufo���s. i watched ufo hunters religiously and every other tv show that might be on regarding the subject. but that was pretty much it. that all changed at 9:00 pm monday night the 31st of january, 2009. i was watching the bachelor, the jason\\molly fiasco. we have a large window which is to my left. we live in the country in northern california, so we���re talking relatively dark. a new moon reported on january 26 with a quarter moon on february 2nd. so we���re in the middle���. what i���m trying to say is it wasn���t pitch dark outside. as i���m watching tv, out of the corner of my eye to my left hand side i see what i can only describe as a big round whitish-yellow light. it ���dips��� down so i can���t help but see it. needless to say, i was startled. i couldn���t imagine what could possibly be that large, only 15��� away from my window moving in the air! i���ve been struggling with how to describe it, but it was about the size of a tire. we have two yellow labs, both jumped up when i jumped out of my seat. i don���t recall them barking, they just got excited, because i was excited. still unaware of what the heck i was dealing with (a helicopter?) i went to the front door which was directly behind my chair. i went out to the covered porch, down the stairs and looked immediately to my left and up. i still have trouble wrapping my mind around what i saw that night. but here goes���.. i���m hard of hearing, but the first thing i did was check to see if my hearing aid was in my ear, because i heard no sound, but, there was a definite electrical buzz\\feeling in the air. as i turned to my left and looked up i saw directly above tree level, perhaps 40 feet a craft. it was floating, best way to describe it, floating forward very slowly, perhaps 5-10 miles an hour. by the time that i was able to get outside, down the stairs, and was able to observe it, only the back end of the craft was visible to me. it was, and still is the most incredible thing i have ever seen. it was a real space ship. it was definitely metallic, burnished kind of metal. white, blue, red lights adorned the back of the craft. because i only saw the back end of it i���d say the size of it was a big car. not as big as i would have imagined (had i thought about it at all). as it floated over my house it continued over the trees and was lost from my sight. from that night to this day i have become totally immersed, via the internet, in finding out everything i can about ufo���s. i���m a daily mufon reader. trying to find out if anybody else had a similar sighting. what excites me and frightens me at the same time is that the ship made a point of ���knocking��� on my door, i.e. coming down to less than 15 feet from the ground and shining the light in my window to get my attention. it wanted me to know about and become involved with ufo���s and the only way to do that was by doing something dramatic. my husband works in the city but i called him, after i recovered sufficiently, to let him know what happened. it���s been hard for him to grasp, but i���m a level headed 58 year old woman and he believes in me. a few close friends know but i don���t really talk about it with anyone anymore. i didn���t tell my story until now because, well������. same old story���. who���s gonna believe you? if you harp on it too much, you become ���weird���. thank goodness for the internet. few days after this happened i went and bought binoculars and a camera."],"Summary":"January 31, 2009 sighting in Northern California","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Oroville","There were no other sightings in Oroville on or around January 31st 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-121.551029","Date Submitted":"10/26/2009 04:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.516635,+-121.551029(20144)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20144) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/31/2009 09:00 UTC","Case Number":"20144","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Latitude":"39.516635","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10262009-0013","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Oroville","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20144.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20144.html"]}
