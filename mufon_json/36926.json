{"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn September 1, 2010, I arrived home after work around 6pm. I went to the backyard and noticed a flock of small yellowish birds on the tree. There must have been about 75 ��� 100 of them. I had never seen these birds much less a flock of them hanging out on our tree. I was amazed and amused at the same time. I was thinking how beautiful they were when suddenly I noticed this white cylinder object just moving ever so smoothly and softly above the treetop. It was gently moving horizontally towards the south. It was a cloudless, sky blue, sunny day and this object was quite visible. I noticed no noise, no trail of smoke behind it. It had no lights at all; it had a perfect square in the center like a window but with no glass. I was astounded by the sight and could not believe what I was seeing. I could not move at all. I was mesmerized by this object. I did not video even though my video cam and camera was within 15 feet of my presence. My daughter was about 25 feet away from me and I did not even call her to come and witness what I was seeing. No thought of anything came into mind about videoing, calling someone, nothing of that sort. I was just in awe following the white, cylinder object until I could see it no more. If you go to youtube.com and type in white cylinder ufo, you can see what I���m talking about. The video with the electrical lines going across on the video shows a better description of what I saw. This is not my video but shared by someone else on youtube. I���m merely just showing that I saw an object very similar to that one. This way you have an idea or know what I���m talking about at least."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-03272012-0028","Date Submitted":"03/27/2012 04:54 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/01/2010 06:15 UTC","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Harlingen","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"26.198091","Case Number":"36926","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Harlingen","There were no other sightings in Harlingen on or around September 1st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.198091,+-97.688313(36926)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36926) map </A>","Summary":"Cylinder white object with center square slightly popped out; it flew so soft and smoothly.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36926.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36926.html"],"Longitude":"-97.688313"}
