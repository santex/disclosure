It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, took 8-10 sec. to travel half way across the sky. As it was more overhead could see another object following in the same path and same speed approx. 12-15 degrees behind the first. I did get a short video on my phone just as they vanished overhead, did not fade like satellites do as they move across the night sky. Just vanished as seen in my video. My wife was witness as well. Did anyone else see this? Contact me..."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Golden Valley","There were no other sightings in Golden Valley on or around October 9th 2012"],"Summary":"Bright Lights, 2 objects tracking in same path, approx. 12 degrees apart, going at high rate speed.","Date Submitted":"10/10/2012 11:28 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Arizona","Case Number":"43129","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"34.903334","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43129.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43129.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/09/2012 07:46 UTC"}
