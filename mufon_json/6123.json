This object could not have been larger than a mini-van, and was approximately 100 feet from my position. I got such a good look at the object that to this day I can remember just how clean and perfect it looked. My skin still get's goosebumps thinking about it. The object made no strange movements, it stayed straight and was perfectly silent. This sighting was my third, but most important to me since it was my only daytime sighting. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and was crisp spring morning. The object traveled south west, and appeared to gain altitude as it disappeared. I noticed the object at about 300 feet up, maybe less and only 100 or 200 feet from my location. We have a military base across the street from the sign shop, Camp Parks U.S. Army Reserve. I have always thought that the object was leaving that base."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"White Egg-shaped Object Slowly Passes Overhead","Date of the Event":"03/15/2001 11:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/15/2001 11:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Egg","Longitude":"-121.935792","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6123.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6123.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Dublin","There were no other sightings in Dublin on or around March 15th 2001"],"Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Dublin"}
