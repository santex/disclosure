TV presenter John Inverdale was interviewing Tennis celebrity John McEnroe, both men were sitting down facing one another. When the camera viewed them both from the side a glowing object could be seen in the sky over John McEnroe, some distance way. The camera operator viewed the object twice, but; the third time the camera viewed the men; the camera operator had zooomed in to avoid filming the object. Which indicates that the camera operator was aware of the UFO. The object appeared to be hovering. I thought the object was maybe a helicopter."],"Longitude":"-0.120395","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash, Oval, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Summary":"UFO over Wimbledon Tennis 2008","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"11312","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11312.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11312.html"],"trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around June 24th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-06262008-0005","Date Submitted":"06/24/2008 10:57 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"England","City":"London"}
