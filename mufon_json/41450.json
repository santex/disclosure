At first I thought it might be the sun coming thru the clouds but the color seemed odd It was hard to keep looking as I was driving, I looked again this time I could clearly see the sun and to the far right I noticed now three of the bright light disks in formation with no cloud cover, I could not tell if they were flying or stationary. I looked to see if other drivers were looking, when I glanced back they were gone."],"Tags":"City"}
