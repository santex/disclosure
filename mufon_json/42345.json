{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Glowing fire ball going fast over head","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/06/2012 08:48 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was at night around 9-10 pm my wife and I were on our way to return some movies. I always look up when I go outside as I look up in the sky toward the moon I see a glowing ball with what looks like fire around it. I asked my wife what the heck is that? she seemed a little surprised and said what the heck is that. From what seemed like about 300 or so feet high above us it came moving fast over head from southeast straight over head toward the northwest toward Canton Ohio area. My wife first said that looks like a Chinese lantern but it was moving real fast I would say as fast as an air plane but it made absolutely no noise at all, And was moving against the wind. We continued to watch it as it seemed to get higher and higher until it went above the clouds. My wife then turns to me and says what the heck was that? I said I have no idea. I was quick enough to take a quick pic with my cell phone. When I in zoom it looks like a giant ball of fire."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.902443","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"42345","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09062012-0019","Latitude":"40.418887","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42345.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42345.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.418887,+-82.902443(42345)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42345) map </A>"}
