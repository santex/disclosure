The object was immediately noticeable and drew the attention of myself and two of my friends that were with me. The three of us immediately said it was a UFO. The object was a blue disc that emitted a small cone of light from the bottom, though the cone was only a few feet lower than the object. It came from above my house, moving in an exact South-East alignment before abruptly darting South and disappearing. The whole encounter only lasted about 3 seconds. As soon as I saw it I couldn't take my eyes off it, and immediately after the hair stood up on my arms and neck and the three of us couldn't believe what we just saw. At first I was confused and panicking, then became somewhat fearful and felt as if something else was going to happen, though nothing ever did."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52157.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52157.html"],"trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Riverside","There were no other sightings in Riverside on or around November 10th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.955163,+-117.409846(52157)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52157) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.955163","Case Number":"52157","Summary":"Blue disc of light moved from above my house then changed direction quickly.","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Riverside","Object Features":"Unknown"}
