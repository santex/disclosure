{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-71.056513","divs":["sighting detailsthis object appeared out of the corner on my eye as a boomerang shape, roughly 1\\2 degree across (the size of the full moon), moving from west to east. it traveled at about the same speed as a conventional aricraft, but it was apparently very low (judging by it's speed) and did not make any sound what-so-ever. one would have expected some engine noise at such a low altitude. there were no aircrfaft lights visible through the entire journey across the sky. i thought maybe otis air national guard base was receiving a stealth fighter."],"City":"Boston","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20159.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Flyning rather low overhead","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.362731,+-71.056513(20159)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20159) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/01/2003 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"10/27/2009 08:54 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"20159","Log Number":"US-10272009-0009","Object Shape":"Boomerang","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Boston","There were no other sightings in Boston on or around June 1st 2003"],"Latitude":"42.362731","Region":"Massachusetts"}
