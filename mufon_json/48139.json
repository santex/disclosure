On the way back up the driveway I noticed 3 red lights in the night sky coming down from the Pittsburgh area. I knew right away that it wasn't a jet because of the red lights and the way it was gliding. The red lights on each end were slighly smaller than the middle one. And I would say that the craft was of good size. As large as a Jet or bigger. The red lights I would say were probably 12 to 2o feet in diameter, estamating from the distance that I saw the craft. For it was about the same as a flight leaving the airport. Also no sound. I was the only one that saw it. But it was the speed in which it left our atmosphere. It moved so fast I never saw it take off and I was watching the whole time. Two to three sec. later I caught it moving out into space and it looked like a tiny star."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Ohiopyle","There were no other sightings in Ohiopyle on or around July 18th 2010"],"Latitude":"39.85214","Case Number":"48139","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-06142013-0024","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.85214,+-79.491928(48139)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48139) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48139.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48139.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/14/2013 11:28 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/18/2010 10:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"Sighted 3 red lights, object appeared to be gliding, in 1 sec. it looked like a star going out into space.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-79.491928"}
