I looked up very quickly because I thought it was a satellite or a shooting star, but to my surprise it was much, much too large to be either, much bigger than a plane reflecting light from something. It was incredibly eery and I didn't know what to think because I'd never seen anything like it or believed I ever would. To put it simply I was astounded. I gawked at it as it moved quickly from the center of my vision, where I first saw it descending, into the tree line and disappeared. It was also unlike any color I'd ever seen in the sky, like a very bright greenish blue, almost white. I felt very creeped out in a crazy way after this event."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
