several mornings when it was -25f- suddenly and surprizingly. and i thought, \"who brought cold air in?\"- as a sort of joke- because the extreme temperature was not normal- with the conditions we were having in general. during this time i was on trip home in car (toyota) driving from thunder bay, via dog lake road- and my youngest daughter beau was with me in vehicle: she is 16(just short of 17th birthday) and sitting in the front passenger's seat. as we passed the large culverts which are situated in the mackintyre river- just across the road from a major gravel pit- she said to me that she saw \"circles floating in the river!\". it was late afternoon- 3:30\\maybe 4:30? and we were in a bit of a rush: i was taking her home, and planning to return to town, as another daughter: age 21:mother of a 3 yr old and a newborn pre-mie who was still in neo-natal icu at hospital- i was planning to go back to her house for the night. so, i did not stop, turn around to go back and see.\\ my daughter described the circles as \"looking like big white innertubes floating in the water\" or \"like a mushroom cloud- as in a nuclear explosion: when it fans out and looks like a tube- like that.\" it was about 8 days later that i was once again in transit, bringing my daughter home from town, this time at about 9:30 a.m.- and she mentioned that the circles were still floating in the river. i stopped, turned around and went back for pictures, and also took videos: as much as i could with my digital camera. we were in awe of what we were seeing. and it took time to process- at first impression, we thought perhaps the circles were forming, there in the pool- but as we continued to ponder the sight, this explanation just did not seem adequate to describe how they formed.\\ and it was like being in a state of shock: as though- what it is- you are realizing, and yet- slow\\ like numb- or half asleep- coming out of fog- to realize just what you are seeing. we wandered about, taking a few other pictures, then headed homeward on backroads- observing and checking out other beaver pools\\ rivers etc. because you are thinking \"perhaps there are more elsewhere?\"- at the same time realizing- you have never seen anything like this:!! ever- anywhere- in person\\ on film\\ in a magazine\\ or a book.. not anywhere> then, we came home and downloaded the pictures and videos to computer,and then cleared some other pictures off of camera, and charged batteries- and just watched, and wandered, and sat and considered... thought about who to talk to\\ what to do... began to think perhaps we should contact some sort of news?? but by this time, day was late and light (it was dark and cloudy all day) was too far gone for further observation. next day: tried contacting the \"argus\" at tbay university: thinking- \"colledge newspaper\\ liberal- connected to science- might want to investigate?!- and not be inclined to censor...\" but when i called there, i was told that they had closed their department for christmas break- \"keep an eye on them, and contact us in january or february if you see them again\" and this just sort of- surprised me, and put me off- i then debated whether to try contacting the public newspaper- chronicle journal- but was unsure whether they were still there... didn want to send someone on a wild goose chase... had to go look first- and it is perhaps 16kms from where i live- almost 1\\2 of way to town\\ we got ready and went back: and there were only 2 circles left in the eddy- 2 large ones, and a misshaped medium one, and a small one... so we took more video, and wandered about and took other still shots of area... there had been no melting conditions between the previous day and this: so i was baffled as to why- so many were now missing. we had had a small dusting of snow: enough to show that a deer, a wolf, a couple rabbits, a squirrel- had gone through the area- but no moose tracks< car treads, people prints- no other traffic. and none near the river banks of any sort. then i managed to make my way down to the river edge, and i was able to snag one of the circles with a stick, and pulled it to the bank, and we had a closer look- and took pictures- to show size, diameter, and make up(i pulled the disc about 1\\2 way out of water, and daughter took picture of underneath side with light shining through). i did not pull it all the way out: as i did not want to break it. i took my glove off- and felt the ice with my bare hand- and had daughter do the same: and we observed that it looked like frozen bubbles, and felt somewhat like styrofoam- in texture. i eased it down into the water, and gently pushed it back out into the pool: and i was sad as i saw that it no longer rotated in the same rythm as before: it had lost its natural momentum- it felt like an, ���h darn- i killed it`- sort of a situation. there was an aura of sacredness- to the entire experience. i did not want to break or take one away from the river. in the hours, days and weeks that followed- i showed the video to various and sundry people, and observed actions and reactions... still wondering where or who to talk to- most would look, and say, `what the hell is that���!!���`... and i would say, -these are ice circles- in the mackintyre river... i went to the chronicle journal- asked to see an editor- and whoever it was i saw, sent me to the radio\\t.v. station. i went to the radio\\t.v. station- and the referred fellow- was intrigued when he saw the film- but it was the next day ( dec2, 2009 )- and i had looked on my way into town, and saw that the remaining 2 circles were now gone: and still not really melting conditions: we had had more cold\\ more snow- and when he heard they were no longer there- he said, -it is hard to make a story about something that no lonter exists.- -and - we would need to get our own footage...- and then he wanted to make a copy of the video from my camera- and i let him do that- he took the camera, queued to the spot- to his office while i waited in outer waiting room- and brought it back after. i felt like i was making a major mistake in that- but no files were missing- i still get a sick feeling in my gut, though- just thinking about that- anyway, onward and forward.... at some point i managed to upload some of the video and re-sized pictures- to the web- phantomsandmonsters.com and facebook- and youtube... i am thinking that there may yet be remnants of the circles in the pack ice, downstream from the pool where we first noticed them. we had a snow that filled the ponds with a couple inches of slush: just within 36 hours of our filming: and then the deep cold set in: and it is only beginning to melt- now- in past 32 hours. what intrigues me the most is how- the experience is rather dream-like. comprehension is inhibitted by social and emotional- conditioning or other factors- but when one tries to actually explain- how- such things formed: one comes up with ideas of answers that are not- shall we say- socially acceptable- in normal circles. when facing a riddle- the simplest solution- no matter how improbable or unbelievable- is most probably the answer. sherlock holmes. the discs were made of frozen bubbles: mixed with tiny white hailstones: looked like the water was touched by a rod- or rods- that were the temperature of dry ice or colder: causing the water to boil, and freeze instantly- and the number: 9 almost identical circles: to me it suggests a configuration of some sort- of 9 feet or legs- and the smaller circles may have been touch points of hozes- just a theory. from the size of the discs: about 30inches across each- if placed in a pattern of 3 isoscolyse triangles- comprising a fourth triangle in center: distance would indicate a base of about 15 feet across- a size that would fit just within the eddy where the circles floated... and having played with the dots- concept- in paint, and then put at an angle- in the stretch-scew mode- created a configuration which- if superimposed above the pictures of the circles: matches. - - -- - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ---- - - - -

shatner... ���nd wanting me to give them my videos for their production. < i am still looking for someone with an honest, scientific interest in investigating the actual facts of the situation. it would take a skidoo or perhaps a helicopter: search the river downstream (perhaps less than a mile) to see whether the circles are frozen in the ice at the next beaver dam or snag. considering the nature of the find- it seems important to me."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Country":"Canada","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Thunder Bay","Case
