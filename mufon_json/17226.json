There were 14 to b exact, they were stationary, other than the fact that they changed formation over 8 time while I was observing them. They did not move across the sky until 2 hours later when we observed them moving quite fast than all coming to a stop, and than moved again until the disappeared. I have been in the military for well over 18 years (retired). What I had saw was not a weather balloon as I have seen plenty in my lifetime while stationed around the world. These lights in the sky had intelligent moving about them and seemed like they were changing formations about every 15 to 20 min. I had my whole crew come to look at them as well as other employees at the warehouse that I work. We all agreed that the objects in the sky were odd and nothing any of us had ever seen."],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/28/2009 07:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17226.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17226.html"],"Case Number":"17226","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.452707"}
