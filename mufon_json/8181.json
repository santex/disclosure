I was impressed by how fast it was moving and how quickly it turuned. I looked for it some more didn't see it. I went back into my apartment and got online to report it."],"trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 2 other sightings in New York on or around October 21st 2007"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10212007-0002","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"8181","City":"New York","Summary":"fast moving","Date of the Event":"10/21/2007 03:08 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.722673,+-74.004583(8181)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8181) map </A>"}
