I looked to the east by occasion and then I saw this amber light that was too big to be a star or planet. It wasn't pulsating, but I can infer that it was very bright. I stared at it for 2 minutes and then it faded away. When I saw it I knew it was something abnormal. I told my parents after it faded and they didn't really buy it."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41077.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41077.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/22/2012 11:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Summary":"I saw a gloing light appear stationary for 1-2 minutes and then vanished.","Log Number":"US-07222012-0030","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
