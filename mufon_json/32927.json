I was standing at my front door facing west to get pictures of the snow to email to my husband who was out of town. When I zoomed in on the object I noticed that it had an unusual shape. In the second picture it had change it shape or direction but was in the same general location. We live just to the south west of a US Army Post. We have a lot of military craft fly over but they are all painted dark green or black and make a lot of noise. There is also a small air field to the south of me but all of the planes that go over from there make a lot of noise. I didn't hear anything. It seems too shinny to be a bird. I was wondering if you could tell me what it might be."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.434942,+-105.000728(32927)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32927) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/28/2011 04:17 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"10/27/2011 06:30 UTC","Longitude":"-105.000728","Summary":"Silver object captured in picture on the left side just above the tree branch","City":"Penrose","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"38.434942","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Penrose","There were no other sightings in Penrose on or around October 27th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10282011-0011","Case Number":"32927"}
