I was in Meridian Hill Park and saw a strange light moving slowly across the sky heading South. It abruptly turned left to the East then after a while appeared to be lowering, then the light went out. i couldnt tell how high up it was, but i dont thik it would be too high becasue you couldnt see anything else ecept the moon last night. My friend who was with me had seen a diamond shaped UFO up close as a 10 year old and also seen others said \"that's how they move\". It was strange, if anyknown has any info on what that might have been or if anyone else saw it, that would be great."],"Summary":"A light like a planet on an overcast night moved accross the sky, took a left and then lowered and went out.","Case Number":"17209"}
