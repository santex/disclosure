There were four lights moving across the sky. I thought at first that they were some kind of bird that was glowing, or fireflies that had been somehow magnified; however, I quickly noticed that they were repeating a pattern. They would meet in the middle and then spread out into four corners. As they spread out, their shape became more oval. They moved fluidly. I had never seen anything like them before and for a moment, I thought they may have been spirit orbs. We observed them for several minutes, then my daughter became frightened and we went inside."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Strange lights in the Sky","Region":"Oregon","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13894.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13894.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-11222008-0009","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/21/2008 06:20 UTC","Case Number":"13894"}
