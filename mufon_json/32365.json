I had gone to get a new alarm clock, I needed to replace my old one, because my old alarm clock doesn���t work anymore. After when we���ve parked the car on the side street heading toward my apartment, my buddy and me had notice a bright shining object up in the sky looking towards the east sky over by Midway Airport. I���ve pulled out my camera phone, and taken two different angle shot of two short video shots as I was documenting this event, of this unknown bright object up in the sky. As we walked up mu buddy had noticed the object was moving towards us very slowly, but to me it had just hovered hanging there towards the east. None of us don���t know what it really was, because we could not really identified it; it could of have been a planet, a star, a satellite, space junk, or even a top secret spy drone that could be used to capture video images of the gang activity in the Chicagoland area. A few of my neighbors was out in the parking lot over at my apartment complex fixing a flat tire on his truck. He said it was just a bright star, however nobody doesn���t know what it was what we had seen. I do NOT know what this was that I had seen last night, can anyone please tell me what me and a few others had seen last night up in the sky���"],"City":"Bedford Park","Case Number":"32365","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bedford Park","There were no other sightings in Bedford Park on or around October 4th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"10/05/2011 10:35 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"A Bright Object Up in the Sky at Chicago Midway Bedford Park Area","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-87.771361","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32365.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32365.html"],"Log Number":"US-10052011-0012","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.774078,+-87.771361(32365)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32365) map </A>"}
