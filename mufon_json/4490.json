Off to the west, I could see four bright yellow lights that appeared to be a few thousand feet off the ground. I turned off at exit 108 and parked my vehicle on the side of the road. The four lights moved independent of each other. One light rose very high in the sky in a very short amount of time (less than ten seconds) before fading out. The other three lights moved across the sky staying probably a few thousand feet off the ground. They moved from south to north and then appeared to move towards the west as they grew dimmer. They then each rose very quickly into the sky and faded out much like the first one. After looking at a map, I would estimate that I was about six miles to the southeast from the boundries of Fort Carson and I would put the lights at about ten to fifeteen miles away. They were very bright, but not extremely large. I would compare their size to that of a light on cell phone towers at a distance of about five miles."],"Summary":"Bright Yellow Lights Dancing In The Sky","Case Number":"4490","City":"Fort Carson","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/25/2006 10:15 UTC"}
