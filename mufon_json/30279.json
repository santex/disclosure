So i got up and went into the kitchen for moment, than decided to walk out and sit on the steps of my backdoor to see how light it was outside. It was still pretty dark but I could barely see it begin to brighten. While I was looking up at the stars I noticed a star-like object moving east. At first I thought it was a shooting star because of the hieght. It was REALLY high up there. But was NO shooting star. Was clearly not a plane and im pretty sure it wasn't a satellite. It was moving at a good rate but not too fast. I watched it move east untill it just dimmed out of view. It appeared to kinda dim untill I could almost not see anything, than it reapear to normal. And again, very star-like. I watched it for about mabey a minute and was thinking ''no way'' the whole time. Because it was so far up there, and the rate it was moving, it could have been traveling at 800 to 900 mph. Thats my geuss. And yes I did try to wave at it."],"Summary":"Small star-like object moving east.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Sherman","There was one other sighting in Sherman on or around July 21st 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/21/2011 05:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07212011-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30279.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30279.html"],"City":"Sherman","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.642202,+-96.60031(30279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30279) map </A>","Longitude":"-96.60031","Latitude":"33.642202","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"30279"}
