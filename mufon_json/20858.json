At the same time my daughter yelled \"what is that!\", we stared at it as we were passing by. It was really close to us kind of hovering i guess, my daughter turned her head i looked in my rear view, side view, and turned my head to look out the window again, but it was gone, we lost sight of it as if it just disappeared. I seen like whit lights all around it if it were like the body but as if it were made of like a plastic material. it was the size of two or three cars but shaped oddly round but high. my daughter says she just seen white and round and thought it was the size of two cars. She is eight years old and started crying that she didn't want the earth to be attacked by aliens and is afraid they will come for her because she is the one who seen them. I felt like i couldn't believe my eyes but it was too close to be a mistake i clearly seen it."],"Region":"Colorado","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20858.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20858.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/03/2009 04:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"11/30/2009 05:15 UTC","trends":[],"Longitude":"-105.772367","Summary":"my child and i seen ufo near 50 feet away we stared at it as we passed we turned around to watch it and it disappeared wont know if it went up down outward it was like white with lights or reflectors","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.552751,+-105.772367(20858)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20858) map </A>"}
