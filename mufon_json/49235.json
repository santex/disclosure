It was round at first and seemed to be moving fast. I initially though it was something falling from the sky because of its speed and shape. It was not consistently round enough to be a balloon and it was moving parallel to the ground swiftly. It seemed to either change shapes as it moved away or was spinning or turning."],"Summary":"A black oval object which was spinning or changing shape flew above"}
