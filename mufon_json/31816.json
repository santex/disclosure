At first I thought it was a green firecracker, but it was flying horizontally. It didn't last long, less than a minute. I've never seen anything like it before. It looked like a green fireball and dissappeared into thin air. I couldn't think of a practical explanation for the object I saw. It was fairly close to where I was standing outside in the backyard. I later looked online and thought maybe it could be a military flare, but I don't know of glowing green military flares. I felt confused and wanted to make sense of what I saw, but I couldn't. I was at my parent's house, but I was the only one outside who witnessed this event. I wished I had it on video but it happened so fast."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09142011-0016","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Flash","Longitude":"-111.999422","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31816.html"],"Case Number":"31816","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.503828","City":"Phoenix","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
