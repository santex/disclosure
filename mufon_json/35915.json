To my left suddenly appeared another flickering star light that ascended to the sky towards my direction and upwards. faster than an airplane but not 'zooming fast'. i watched until i was physically shaking too much and was afraid i'd get a migrain like i had in previous sightings. I couldn't stare any longer so I came inside. Odd though, that it wasn't like I had never seen them before, so it didn't have that same \"wow\" effect. it was somehow like they were telling me something i already knew. i would have taken a picture but they were too high in the sky and my camera would have never captured it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.542243,+-69.640045(35915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35915) map </A>"}
