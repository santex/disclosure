{"Weather Factors":"None","divs":["sighting detailsthis is my second report. i will send the completed report form to my local field investigator. aug. 19, 2009 - 01:29. i had just fed our big dog, who will only eat at night. i was standing on the deck, looking at the sky. i was looking through binoculars at a cluster of stars at approx. 80 degrees above the horizon, southwest. suddenly something large, red and reflective passed through my field of view. it was traveling exceptionally fast, close and it startled me. i stepped off the deck and into the yard, where another object, then another flew overhead. they were not birds or bats. such creatures do not usually produce light. these objects seemed to be rectangular and had a dim, reddish glow. i became unnerved by these objects and was about to go back inside, when i looked up and to the east. there was a brightly lit object moving due west to east at 80 degrees. by the time it got to 40 degrees east agl (my vantage point), it vanished. the object was like two orbs connected by a rod, much like a dumbbell\\barbell. the light was pure white, with what appeared to be a short flame at the end of the rear orb. there was no meteor-like tail. it did not disappear like a meteor does when it burns up. it was more like disappearing into a dark tunnel. there was no sound associated with this object but as i recall, something might have been \"dripping\" off the rear orb. that could explain the orange-like flame. it seemed to me, that the object was very large and within close proximity to me, between 500 and 1,000 ft. the object in the depiction i am sending is close to actual size of the object as i witnessed it for 2 brief seconds. i can say that if my spouse had seen this with me, i'd have had to shovel his bottom jaw up off the ground. he has only seen one strange object in the sky (he was alone at the time), and still isn't sure what it was. total time of sighting these objects, approx. 1 minute. 1. i was outside with my dog, looking at the sky 2. i saw the first object when it passed through my field of view, while i was looking through binoculars. something made me stop from going into the house, to turn and look at the dumbbell shaped object. 3. my first thought was, \"oh, no!\" fear. 4. the first objects were extremely fast, yet close to me, within probably 30 feet. they moved so fast i only caught glimpses. the white object moved in a straight trajectory from west to east and vanished. 5. my first reaction was to get back into the house as quickly as possible. why i stopped, i do not know. after i saw these objects i felt very uneasy, still do. 6. the bright white dumbbell shaped object vanished and i beat a hasty retreat into the house. where the other objects went, i don't know."],"Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Fireball, Sphere, Square, Rectagular, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18840.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18840_submitter_file1__8-19-09_barbellUFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18840.html"],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Breckenridge","There was one other sighting in Breckenridge on or around August 19th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"18840","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Several rectangular, dimly glowing reddish objects and one white dumbbell/barbell shaped glowing white object","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/19/2009 01:29 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/19/2009 01:29 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.762247","City":"Breckenridge","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.762247,+-98.89917(18840)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18840) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08232009-0017","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.89917"}
