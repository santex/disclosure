We were watching a movie then it started to rain. So we looked out the window,then we watched the movie again. Then my friend went to one of the windos, and I had the urge to go to the other one. Then I saw two big orange lights and one blue alltogether falling from the sky at an angle.It lasted about 5 seconds. Then I looked closer, and I saw a very faint silver line over them. Then it disappeared behind a big tree."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"7829"}
