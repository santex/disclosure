{"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI am in total disbelief at what i witnessed this evening, i was in my garden with my friend we were looking up at the stars when we saw an unidentified flying object... we tried to debunk what we were witnessing playing with the theories could it be a helicopter?. We dismissed this as the object was flying too high... Plane maybe?. Again too high both coupled with the fact this was one solid glowing light and no flashing lights this object moved seemingly slowly from south to north and finally vanished from view, within minutes 2 jets appeared close to where the object had vanished and flew in opposite directions (one east and the other north west) and within seconds 2 more jets flew at high speed directly over my house from west to east i am astonished its thee most surreal thing i have even seen. I am now a firm believer that we are not alone."],"Region":"","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Grimsby","There were no other sightings in Grimsby on or around April 16th 2013"],"Longitude":"-0.114551","Object Shape":"Blimp, Boomerang, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.551023,+-0.114551(46803)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46803) map </A>","Case Number":"46803","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46803.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46803.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/16/2013 09:37 UTC","City":"Grimsby","Summary":"Myself and my friend witnessed a ufo then 4 jets!!!","Latitude":"53.551023","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"04/16/2013 07:33 UTC","Log Number":"GB-04162013-0016"}
