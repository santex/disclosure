I never saw anything like the object before. It was spherical in shape and emitted an orange glow. The object was moving steadily from the SW to the NE at variable speeds, at times ascending and then descending. Four objects were seen in total travelling in the same direction approximately a minute or two apart in similar paths. The objects disappeared from our field of view. All of us were stunned and surprized as we had never observed anything like this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49418.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49418.html"],"Longitude":"-74.144032","Date of the Event":"08/02/2013 11:20 UTC","City":"Kearny","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Kearny","There were no other sightings in Kearny on or around August 2nd 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Myself and 2 others saw bright orange spherical objects moving in sky.","Tags":"City","Case Number":"49418","Date Submitted":"08/03/2013 01:06 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
