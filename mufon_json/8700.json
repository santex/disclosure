(if that makes sense) i began to figure it was maybe a planet or like, what ever yanno? tried to remain scientific about it. i kept my head about things and stayed calm. i mean i was certain i would never see something like a ship or whatever in my lifetime. as i figure these sightings are rare?? right? i didn't want to really think it was anything but a planet or whatever. so i called a friend who follows star and planets and things from an astrological nature. i thought maybe some strange mercury retrograde thing making me think this planet was a moving backwards. she would clear this up and i could laugh at him over the next 20 years saying \"hey honey remember when you thought jupiter was a ufo\" type thing, right? well...she too saw it! and agreed it was moving. her boyfriend (a total skeptic also agreed this \"thing\" appeared to move) we called several other people (mom's, sister's, nephew's, friends) all agreed it wasn't a \"explanable thing\". and that it was moving in an interesting manner. it is still there in the sky at the moment i write this. as i wanted to get online someplace and see if there were sightings. so i cannot say when it left. i'm still wondering if there is some other explanation. i would like to see if there are other \"sightings\" of this and if we're just looking at something else. i did want to note (at 11:07) husband came in to report he thinks he saw a shooting star. thought this might be interesting to note."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.762823,+-86.399717(8700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8700) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"12/25/2007 08:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8700.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8700_submitter_file3__Avon112_25_1800.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8700_submitter_file4__Avon212_252300.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8700.html"],"City":"Avon","Disposition":"IFO"}
