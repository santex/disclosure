My wife called to me and pointed at the sky. She pointed at the cloaked object in the sky. I saw what I can best describe as a very shinny metallic orb in the sky with what I can best describe as a semi oval horseshoe crab shape with two oval light in the tail area. During the few seconds of our sighting the object crossed through a cloud an this revealed its shape as it moved through the cloud. The cloud appeared to flow like water over the object. We lost sight of the object when our view was blocked by a tree in our yard. When we walked around the tree it was gone. We both felt like we witnessed something that should not exist."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48288.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48288.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/18/2013 06:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.844415","Object Features":"Dome","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
