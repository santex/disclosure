I hear the strange noise. It is not a plane we live near the airport and I know what planes sound like. She tells me it was just above the trees near a cloud and went up high and over the building with the noise. Her words were: It looked like a FAKE alien UFO! I had her describe it and draw it. She stayed at the window looking for it again."]}
