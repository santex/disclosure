There, beside the building was a bright star-like light that just stayed in one position as long as we watched. This was near noon time. If it had been a balloon, it would have moved in the wind, itjust stayed still. After many meditation-like attunements with unknowns, it seemed like their verification- we are really here. I have been told many things that I have found strange and ridiculous - I am a Watcher - I am part of the Galactic Federation - undercover. Well, I guess I'm not undercover any more and perhaps it is time to come out. They have been good to me, kind and understanding of my niavity but always answering my questions. I think that is the most important fact, my questions are always answered.
