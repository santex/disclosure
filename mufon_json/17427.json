The top and bottom of this cross changed colors to red, blue and green. We thought it might be Venus as it was that bright. This was not a plane or helicopter as it did not move. There was no noise that we could hear. We watched if for approx. 25-30 minutes and it never moved. I called the radio station KFYI to report it to them and when I came in for my camera and returned the object was gone. We live in the San Tan Mountains and we have a very clear view of most of the valley. We are always watching the skies here. Respectfully submitted, Wendy L.
