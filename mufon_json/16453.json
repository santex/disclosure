It seemed as large as a half-moon. During it's pass I noticed a bright red color in the center. It had three white trails behind it. This object was only in sight for 4-5 seconds and I lost track of it when it disappeared beyond the trees. I'm wondering if anyone else observed it and what was it?"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","City":"Brandon","Summary":"Cylinder shape neon green fireball, three white trails.","Weather Factors":"Windy"}
