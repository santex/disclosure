In the Boundary Waters there are no bright lights across the lake. In a matter of seconds it moved great distances. It looked like a big headlight but just one. We would watch it then look away and in moments it was in a very different place, very far from where we last saw it. After some time, we lost track only to turn around and see it making its way up the cove toward us. We were very scared and had no idea what it was. It was about 12 inches in diameter. It stopped and crossed the penninsula stopping over the one tent out of three where someone was in. It hovered over that tent for some time than in a flash was gone. The next day we told rangers about it and they told us it was a firefly???"],"Log Number":"US-12282008-0018"}
