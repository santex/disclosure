As I was walking back into the house, I looked north, and right near the little dipper(?) there was this bright immobile \"star\". As I was watching it, the \"star\" slowly dimmed out to nothing like it was on a dimmer switch. It hadn't moved at all before it faded out and after it went out I stood there for a few moments to see if the light may have been part of an aircraft's running lights. But the light never came back on and there was no other movement in the sky."],"City":"Eureka","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20045.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20045.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/20/2009 11:00 UTC","Longitude":"-124.154003","Log Number":"US-10202009-0009","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"it was like a bright star or bright planet","Case Number":"20045","Source":"MUFON"}
