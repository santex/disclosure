{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my porch after work. I looked ahead and saw \"the moon\" I don't ever remember it being in that spot.It had a distinct face. ok whatever.. I watched it move enough for me to have to keep tilting my head back. At one point, I closed my eyes because I know the moon doesn't move that fast. I opened them and looked again and saw it shake. Then move up and a little to the right. I freaked out and came in the house."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.718972,+-80.049205(13642)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13642) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/09/2008 12:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/09/2008 12:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11102008-0017","Longitude":"-80.049205","Case Number":"13642","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in West Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in West Palm Beach on or around November 9th 2008"],"Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13642.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13642.html"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Looked like the moon moving fast.","City":"West Palm Beach","Latitude":"26.718972","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle"}
