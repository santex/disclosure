{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 6:40 pm last night I was laying down outside, listening to my ipod and looking up at the night sky. As I laid there I noticed a VERY bright round light, almost like a planet, moving VERY slowly in the sky. As I watched the object coming closer to me I took out my earphones and noticed that the object made NO sound. As the object flew over me I could see that it was round and was so bright that it looked like it was on fire, white fire. I watched the object for about 4-5 minutes moving slowly coming from the south and going north. I then watched the object shoot across the sky and was gone in less then a second. There is a military airbase, MCAS Miramar, just south of me, so I am used to seeing and hearing planes and helicopters flying over. I also attended the MCAS airshow about a month ago and know that all the aircraft I saw there made a lot of noise when it flew over. This object never made a sound, even though the speed at which it took off should have broken the sound barrier."],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.716959,+-117.156175(26334)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26334) map </A>","Case Number":"26334","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-117.156175","Country":"United States","City":"San Diego","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"11/03/2010 03:53 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Latitude":"32.716959","Log Number":"US-11032010-0020","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26334.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26334.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/02/2010 06:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Very bright round object seen in the sky in the Sorrento Valley area of S.D.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There was one other sighting in San Diego on or around November 2nd 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
