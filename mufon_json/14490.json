The three photos are in sequence from my front porch facing North. Unfortunately the second photo is blurred, but you can still see the object. As you can see by the third photo, the UFO is missing. I have no idea how high the object is. Most UFO activity seems to be in the afternoon after 2:00PM and before 5:00PM."],"City":"Winston-Salem","Date of the Event":"12/22/2008 03:27 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.10194,+-80.238276(14490)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14490) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"Second day of taking random pictures of the sky.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.10194","Case Number":"14490","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-80.238276","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12222008-0008"}
