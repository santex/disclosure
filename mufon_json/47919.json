I think there may have been a very faint trail behind it but I'm not positive. For a split second I thought it might be a shooting star. We watched it heading in a straight path, going pretty fast until it was out of sight, which took about a minute. Just after it was out of sight another one came from the same place going the same direction, and we lost sight of it behind a tree. We waited for it to come out on the other side but it didn't. I felt excited, I've always wanted to see a UFO and I couldn't believe it. Shortly afterward at about 2:30 am we went outside for a cigarette and saw a third this time heading the same direction but coming from a different spot in the sky. We watched it until it went behind some dark clouds that we didn't notice at first since the sky is fairly clear tonight."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47919.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47919.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"47.66228","Case Number":"47919","City":"Spokane","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.66228,+-117.417827(47919)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47919) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/06/2013 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.417827"}
