I'm an Investigator, went to downtown LA to investigate him and expose him except UFO's did appear. This last time 8-12-11 I videotapes zooming by at an very high speed several UFO's during the 5 hours I was there with many other people. I also filmed solid light changing colors while in the sky in mid day. Things are strange in this world, it's time to pray. My personal opinion is that it's not man made and it's not from other planets but from the grand deceive. The light in the sky eventually disappeared after about 15 minutes."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Riverside","There were no other sightings in Riverside on or around August 12th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Flash, Saturn-like","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Log Number":"US-08232012-0007"}
