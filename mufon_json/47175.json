My daughter said what the heck is that Mom?! I thought it was an invasion. They were moving slowly towards US, then one broke away from the cluster to get in front. Then I got in my car and my girls said mom they are gone. I asked where and they said they went up and were just gone. We were excited bewildered, although my 6 year old was really scared! I didn't see them leave because at that moment I had to pull foward to order.
