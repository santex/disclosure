{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile looking out the window, I saw a silver object that must of been many miles away and many feet in the air. The object was reflecting sunlight, so I assume it has a reflective surface. It was moving from NE to NW in a straight line, but slowed down for a bit before moving on. Shortly after, I saw an aircraft following it. I assume it was some kind of government surveillance drone, but I'm not 100% sure."],"Latitude":"40.719793","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-73.997103","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"New York","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"09/25/2012 01:25 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/25/2012 02:46 UTC","Log Number":"US-09252012-0009","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"It was a silver object moving accross the sky that had sunlight reflecting off of its surface.","Tags":"City","Case Number":"42814","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42814.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42814.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.719793,+-73.997103(42814)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42814) map </A>","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around September 25th 2012"],"Country":"United States"}
