{"Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn early June 2006 we were staying at my wife's mothers mobile home while she was on vacation in Hawaii and I was looking out the bathroom window smoking a cigarette when I noticed a large black object approaching from the north so I banged on the wall for my wife and daughter to go to the back door to see the object and then I ran from the bathroom to the back door where my wife and daughter were now observing the craft. We watched as the craft slowly approached our location, it took a couple minutes for it to get directly overhead and we watched it until it was directly over the mobile home and we were about to loose sight of the triangle shaped craft so we ran from the back door to the front door which was about 20 feet straight through the mobile home and it took less then 2 seconds but by the time we got out the front door the craft had completely disappeared and there was no sign of it anywhere anymore. We thought it was very odd that a craft we had watched slowly approach our location for a few minutes could disappear without a trace in 2 seconds or so, the craft was a large black triangle with a couple lights and was at least 200 feet wide across the back of the triangle, it was so close that if we were standing on top of the mobile home we could have almost touched the bottom of it and even though it was late at night and dark it was so close that there was no mistaking the shape and color of the craft and could clearly see the entire thing as it slowly flew straight over our heads at a very low altitude and then it vanished without a trace.."],"Case Number":"46220","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Tooele","There were no other sightings in Tooele on or around June 10th 2006"],"Summary":"Large black triangle flew from north to south over mother n laws trailer30 feet over our heads","Region":"Utah","Latitude":"40.514612","City":"Tooele","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46220.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46220.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/10/2006 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-03152013-0012","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-112.309454","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.514612,+-112.309454(46220)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46220) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/15/2013 01:42 UTC"}
