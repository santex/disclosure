(3.2 megapixel). i tried running in after snapping a few picturephone photos of it, grabbing my old telescope. the viewfinder was not setup properly, and by the time i got it usable the object was gone. object was south of my location, which is the northwest side of houston. mapping it, locate beltway 8 and gessner road. from there it would be southernly. i was up most of that evening, being that i continued to hear typical local sounds such as traffic, gunshots, kids racing loud cars, but my favorite was waking up and only hearing the sound of a helicopter. that's when i had realized, i've heard a lot of aircraft activity. i don't normally hear anything but the occasional one here and there after sundown. they were the larger, slower, cargo style aircraft. c130 maybe? then the helicopters i can't say for sure, but they did not sound like a huey. i heard but couldn't find it a couple times, and the few times it had passed by i found it with a spotlight on. it was moving too high\\fast to be a littlebird by local leo, who i don't even think use or have. i thought that it made more sense that they left it on, and were not using it. i am not sure if this high traffic volume of military aircraft has anything to do with this ufo. i found it important to say that in my opinion, it does not. there have been a few nights here and there where i've seen it before, though, usually they flyout northeast in sometype of formation, and once the main group is gone, it's over. only strange human flying object event i had, was that i heard a small plane. there is hooks airport near by for them, but i've never heard them at 4am. i was in and outside of the house a lot that night, hearing typical break-in warning sounds, and checking around the area with flashlight for harris county jail's next member. so for a lot of these human craft experience, i was outside and able to get a clear view around for it's location. i could not see the small craft, only hear."],"Date Submitted":"01/08/2011 06:02 UTC","City":"Houston","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.82213,+-95.57223(27315)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27315) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27315.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27315_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27315.html"],"Latitude":"29.82213","Log Number":"US-01082011-0019","Date of the Event":"01/08/2011 07:00 UTC","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Short sighting of object that changed shape","Longitude":"-95.57223"}
