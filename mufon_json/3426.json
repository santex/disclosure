I was driving home from a friends house, maybe 20 minutes ago, about 9:30 EST. I was stuck in traffic and I looked into the sky above. In the sky, coming fast from the west was a strange sight. It looked like 4 craft in the air, unlike anything I d seen before. They flew in a formation, but it was easy to see 4 distinct shapes. The had lights on them. 2 of the lights were flashing multicolored, the other 2 were bright white. As they made there way across the sky, I heard a sound that went like \"loooooooo\" It doesn t seem like anything of a human convention, but it might be some military thing. I am vetry shook up now though, so I decided to report thjis in, in case it is something more. -Jamal Bradford Miami FL"],"Date of the Event":"03/20/2005 02:59 UTC","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around March 20th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-80.217669","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Hoax","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.794969,+-80.217669(3426)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3426) map </A>","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Miami","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3426.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3426.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"3426","Latitude":"25.794969"}
