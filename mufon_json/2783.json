Then 3 other circular objects either came out from behind or from inside object and hovered in a square shape in the sky. That's when I informed my co-workers to look up into sky. We all saw the 4 light in perfect square hovering in sky appeared to be about 1 to 2 miles up and away from us. then the 3 circular objects formed what looked like straight line then flew extremely fast outwards in different directions from the original object. within a minute or less they returned to the original object and appeared to have entered the object or went back behind it. Then without any sound or change in structure it shot straight to northeast and then what looked like very extreme speed went straight up and disappeared very rapidly. There was no markings or planes in area no clouds for lights to bounce off of and the sky was dimly lit with very few stars."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Columbia City","There were no other sightings in Columbia City on or around August 31st 1999"],"Log Number":"","Date of the Event":"08/31/1999 08:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.157269,+-85.488313(2783)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2783) map </A>"}
