After eating lunch we walked to a location overlooking the Salt River, to look at Roosevelt Dam and a new bridge, over the Salt River Canyon. For some reason I looked up in the sky and was amazed to see several white orbs moving in random directions, and at a high rate of speed, in the sky. We watched the orbs and then noticed, what can best be described as filaments, also moving in random directions across the sky. The filaments were changing shape as they moved. Both the orbs and filaments would appear and disappear. The filaments were definitely not contrails. They moved rapidly and randomly and changed shapes. They also appeared and disappeared rapidly. As a former commercial pilot with thousands of hours of flight time, I am positive contrails do not look, or act the way the filaments we saw did. The filaments were very interesting to watch, as they were sometimes stretched out and then would sometimes curve into arcs, like a rainbow, or into other shapes. As mentioned both the orbs and filaments appeared and then disappeared. This appearing and disappearing was not because they were moving and went out of sight. Sometimes the filaments and orbs would hover and then, as we watched, they would disappear. Several other visitors came to the overlook and saw us looking up and asked about what we were looking at. We pointed out the orbs and filaments and they also saw them. We watched this display for about one-half hour, before we had to leave, in order to return to Phoenix. The dirt road from Roosevelt Dam to U.S. 60, is called the Apache Trail. This road is very narrow, with hair pin turns and winds along the Salt River. This is a dangerous road to drive after dark, so we had to leave the overlook, or we wouldn't have made it to U.S. 60 before dark. The attached picture was taken by my friend and shows both the orbs and one of the filaments, this was the only good picture that showed both types of UFOs in the same frame. The picture is also interesting because an eagle, that was souring in the sky above us, was caught in the frame with the two types of UFOs. We sent this picture and others, to Dr. Paul A. Scowen PhD, in the Physics & Astronomy Dept., at Arizona State University but he said the resolution of the digital photograph wasn���t good enough, to determine what we were seeing. I also notified the Salt River Project and Bureau of Reclamation, both involved in the operation of the Roosevelt Dam, of the sightings. I also let them know of our filming activity, at the overlook, when we returned with video camaras, at a later date. I look forward to getting your feedback on this picture. Have you seen this type of UFO previously in any reports, or are we seeing something that can be explained? I have returned to this overlook on two other occasions and have seen the filaments again but no orbs. On one of these trips, my friend and I took high resolution video cameras with us, in hope of getting footage of the objects we were seeing. The filaments we did see appeared and then disappeared, so quickly, we could not photograph them. Also, the number of filaments we saw was greatly reduced from the number we saw the first time we were at the overlook. I can best describe my feelings during and after the first sighting as being excited at the opportunity to observe this phenomenon. Being able to see the filaments on different occasions also made me realize this was't a one time event. On the second trip, with my friend, where we took video camaras, we were both disappointed, at not being able to capture the objects on film, with good cameras. On the trip I made alone, to the overlook and two, or three, of the filaments desended below the canyon rim, I was scared. I have a Masters Degree, was in law enforcement and a commercial pilot and I can't explain what I saw. My undergraduate degree is in biology and I taught biological and physical science and again, nothing in my experience can explain what I've seen at this location. On the trip to the overlook, that I took alone, two or three of the filaments descended below the rim of the canyon and were between where I was standing and the canyon wall. From the size of the rocks, I estimated that the filaments were approximately 60 ft. in length. The size of the orbs could not be determined, on our first trip, because we couldn���t tell the distance they were from us. I believe MUFON is serious about UFO investigation and I will be happy to take one, or more, of your staff members to the location of the sightings. Because I have seen the filaments on three different occasions, I think that there is a reasonable expectation that they will appear there again. I would suggest going to the site sometime early in January of 2011, in order to best duplicate the date, and weather conditions, when we first saw the orbs & filaments. I am retired, so I am available at any time you want to go. Another consideration for going in January, is that, at that time there were literally dozens, of both the orbs & filaments, in the sky."],"Longitude":"-112.066327","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply"}
