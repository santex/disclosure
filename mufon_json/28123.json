{"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-116.210602","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was just looking at the stars with my Android sky map app and i noticed about 5 star like lights in a perfect angular formation traveling over me from south east to north west. It wasn't making any noise that I would have heard if it was a plane especially since it appeared to be flying closer to the ground then airplanes normally would. It looked also like a silhouette of a perhaps larger stealth structure in the form of a v shaped wing or some large wing typed craft."],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle, Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/05/2011 07:01 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03052011-0027","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Indio","There were no other sightings in Indio on or around March 5th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/05/2011 11:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28123.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28123.html"],"Summary":"Saw something glide over me - unsure what the darn thing was","City":"Indio","Region":"California","Case Number":"28123","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.726787,+-116.210602(28123)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28123) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"33.726787","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
