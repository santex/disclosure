Finally I woke up at 5am made coffee and went onto the balcony to smoke a cigarette. My balcony is facing north- east. The sky was clear of clouds and the night was quiet. I saw 2 perfect circles (in perspective)close to each other.They were not moving. Both were indentical in size and clarity. They both had lights that were flickering.Hence I could not count them, but they were arranged in circle as well. I took a picture with my 35mm camera and checked every 5-10 min if it was still there. I took another picture at 6am. Finally, around 6:30am to 7am it was gone. I was not feeling disturbed, nor threathened. Just amazed and curious. This is my first sighting."],"trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784751,+-119.410202(9388)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9388) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"9388","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"California","Summary":"2 bright circles close to each other"}
