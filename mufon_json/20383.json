{"Date of the Event":"11/08/2009 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-80.018966","Region":"West Virginia","Summary":"Large bird like object moving @ high speed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside having a smoke and noticed something shiny out of the corner of my eye. When I looked I immediately realized that it was not an airplane, the light from the sun setting was reflecting so brightly it appeared golden in color. I ran in the house and grabbed the camera, I managed to get off one shot. Fortunately it turned out relatively good considering the object was several thousand feet away and traveling about twice the speed of a passenger plane. The object was about twice the size of a passenger airplane also, and it made absolutely no noise as it flew almost right over my house. The object looked very similar to a bird but did not appear to moving mechanically. It was traveling in an almost straight line away from the air force base in Kingwood WV. If further investigation is required, please call the phone # given so that I may approve over the phone."],"City":"Grafton","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20383.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20383.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.340925,+-80.018966(20383)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20383) map </A>","Case Number":"20383","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"39.340925","Object Features":"Wings","Date Submitted":"11/08/2009 05:54 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11082009-0011","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grafton","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
