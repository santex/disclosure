Our place is in the approach path for SeaTac and I was watching the planes approach from the north. I look almost straight up and that is when I saw the object. It was very high, far above the flight paths of the transpacific flights we see from time to time. This was a large black triangular object that did not move for approx ten minutes. It stayed staionary. I'd been looking at it for a few minutes when my wife asked me what I was looking at. I asked her if the could see it, and if it was moving. She said she could see it and that it was not moving. we watched the object for about ten minutes and it then began to move to the south west. The rate at which it moved we very very slow. Based on the height at which the object was it must have been very large, at least the size of a 737. Feel free to contact me via email. Thank you, Omar Reyes"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.61062,+-122.322171(10929)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10929) map </A>","Longitude":"-122.322171"}
