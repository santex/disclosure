the experienced cpatain thought it might be some new technological breakthrough of the us navy being tested off shore as he said happened at times when he was on active duty on rotations from puerto rico to guantanamo back to south florida . well about that statement finished , events proved it wrong as we saw all four or five lights join underwater to become one full lighted larger object which came out of the water perhaps five hundred meters away .we heard water fill some void and splish splashes as the large circular object hovered above the water , yellowish foam had light it enough as was just a few feet above sea level and just suddenly flew off in the blink of an eye. we were all shaken but and didn t know what to do with this and really it challenged all of our realities so we were really reticent to talk about this.as soon as the object was out of sight , light and power were back on , and we were able to join the canadian landlords and get to their place. the subject did come up as we explained why we were later than expected.their place only six hundred meters away didn have any trouble with it s generator.they listened at told us that they had seen some funny stuff around at times and didn t want to speak about it further either. we just went back to our normal lives after that and have never spoken about this experience ever again at any occasion. thaat s about all i can remember from this frightening experience."],"Date of the Event":"05/25/1989 06:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Log Number":"BS-03192008-0002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"The Bahamas","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9973.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9973.html"],"Region":"","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Nassau","There were no other sightings in Nassau on or around May 25th 1989"],"City":"Nassau","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.06,+-77.345(9973)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9973) map </A>"}
