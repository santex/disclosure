I saw a craft in the south-eastern portion of the sky. It was starlike, glowing like a star with no flashing lights and moving very swiftly in a straight line over my house. I observed the craft for aprox. 30-45 seconds, until it went over my house and the roof blocked my view. I have seen craft similar to this on several occasions over my hometown."],"Log Number":"US-06252011-0013","Date Submitted":"06/25/2011 10:54 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"One craft over my house","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"Kentucky","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.558006,+-83.381544(29721)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29721) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"29721","Longitude":"-83.381544","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29721.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29721.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
