In the distance could be heard the sound of my neighbors ATV driving around the undeveloped wetlands adjacent to my property. Suddenly my dog began acting erratically, pulling on the leash to go back inside and turning his head toward the sky, looking this way and that. I spoke to him asking what was wrong and looked around to see what was disturbing him, other than the noise in the woods. That is when I saw a peculiar winged creature flying from out of the woods across the front of the house. The creature���s wings were about three inches across. The wings were transparent and rounded at the ends. If you formed a ���c��� with your thumb and forefinger and then touched your thumb nails together, you would have a rough estimation of the shape of the rear wings of the creature. The wings were not fluttering like a butterfly or vibrating like a dragonfly, which are two common insects in my yard. The creature was gliding, with perhaps a slight vibration. I only saw the creature for the length of time it took to fly to the end of the house. Once it got beyond the house into the open area of the front yard, it disappeared. My eyes were on it the whole time. I was not able to see any of its body, just the back wings from below as described above. By the shape of the wings I assumed it was a four winged creature. My thought after the being disappeared was, ���That must be what people see when they say they have seen a fairy.��� I felt elated seeing this creature. It was nothing I had ever seen before."],"Object Shape":"Other"}
