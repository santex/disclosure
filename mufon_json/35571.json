Upon reviewing the photos I discovered two \"very unusual\" beings sitting on my landing watching me through a mirror that reflects into both rooms. Every person that I have showed this picture to says, \"it looks like aliens.\" This has really bothered me and I would really like this picture to be examined by someone that can tell me what I am seeing in this photo. I have to say these \"things\" look like nothing I have ever seen nor want to see. I hope they are not here all the time and I don't know it for I never have taken pictures of anything on my TV before this day."],"Log Number":"US-02082012-0012","Summary":"I caught a picture of two unknown weird alien-like \"things\" in my house sitting on my stair landing.","Case Number":"35571","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other, Unknown","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.119576","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.968647","Date Submitted":"02/08/2012 09:13 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/29/2011 10:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"N/A","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35571.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35571.html"],"City":"San Diego"}
