I noticed lights moving to the north of me. There were two and they were close together. The first thought was birds in flight, but, they don't have lights. Second thought was remote control planes. They usually fly with the standard aircraft lights. The lights started to perform a maneuver, similar to a lazy eight, during the maneuver the lights disappeared. My thought at that time was that \"This is not right.\" The lights reappeared and started moving to the south, they passed east of my position. One of the lights took up a wingman position, behind and to the left of the lead. They continued to the south, they seemed to be climbing, they eventually faded out, instead of going behind the hill. When first seen the lights were lower the outline of Glassford Hill. After passing the color of the light was golden."],"Date of the Event":"06/02/2011 10:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Prescott","There were no other sightings in Prescott on or around June 2nd 2011"],"Summary":"Lights in Formation","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"06/03/2011 03:14 UTC","Log Number":"US-06032011-0002","Case Number":"29356","Longitude":"-112.466232","Latitude":"34.542204","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Prescott","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29356.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29356.html"],"Region":"Arizona","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other"}
