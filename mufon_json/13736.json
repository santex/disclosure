After observing it hanging in place for a few seconds the golden light began moving at an increasing rate. It picked up speed rapidly and disappeared leaving a streak of light. It was similar to a shooting star except that it was a golden color and wasn't moving for the initial few seconds of observation and the light pollution in the area would have prevented the viewing of shooting stars."],"Longitude":"-111.887907","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13736.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/14/2008 11:45 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/14/2008 11:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-11152008-0019","Tags":"City","City":"Salt Lake City","Summary":"Glowing Golden star-like orb Hanging in sky and then bolted off","Latitude":"40.763069","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.763069,+-111.887907(13736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13736) map </A>","Case Number":"13736","Sighting Duration":"00:00:12","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
