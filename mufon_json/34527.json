It continued for hours. I began noticing lights in the woods where lights dont normally shine. The lights would shift in color from red to orange. When I first noticed the lights I focused a pair of binoculars on one of them and I saw 3 or 4 greys. One of witch was much taller than the others. As soon as I noticed them the light went out. Through out the evening the light would go on and off again. I didn't notice a particular pattern. At first I was creeped out and quite scared. Quickly a calming came over me and I had a conversation with the entities. It was nothing more than an introduction and small talk. I viewed the entities from my pourchc. I felt like I could walk into the woods and have been fine but I was to chicken the event went well into the night. I got sleepy and went to bed. I haven't gone into the woods to investigate. I don't want to disturb anything and I don't want possible radiation sickness.
