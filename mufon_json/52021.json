Sky was pretty clear. Observed on southwest a huge oval shape light. The significant observations were the size, the fact that was very windy but the light was perfectly stationary. There were no blinking lights. There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. the height of the object was strangely lower than any planes that fly in the area. And, Just to validate that it was not an astrological body me, my sister, and my wife went to observe the website after one hour and 40 minutes and it was no place to be seen. Me and my wife have also observed two red lights hovering together in the same area. These red balls were much smaller and they were moving. The red balls were much lower then the most recent huge, oval shaped yellow light. The most recent yellow light was not a helicopter, it was not a plane, it was not a satellite, and it was not a star or any astrological body. I am pretty familiar with all of these in a night sky."],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Oval","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52021.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52021.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"52021","Date of the Event":"11/03/2013 07:00 UTC","Longitude":"-84.541436","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around November 3rd 2013"],"City":"Lexington","Latitude":"38.110974","Sighting Duration":"01:04:13","Summary":"Huge oval shape bright faded yellow light.
