{"divs":["Sighting Detailswe were walking our dog when my husband said look thats a ufo! and i said no way it just looked like all of the rest of the stars to me but much brighter. i said maybee its a planet. it was high up. he said it couldnt be a star because stars twinkle. we stood and argued about it for 5-7 mins as most couples do. it was stationary the whole time, and then it just started to move. although im not sure how fast as i said befor it was quite high up, it was clearing distance fast. then it wasnt bright white anymore it had a red light that was very small in comparison to how the white light looked befor and it was pulsating a very very bright white. like a strobe light. my husband tried to find a pattern in the strobes but couldnt. it moved very very far across the sky from south to north then seemed to stop and stay in place a few minutes, then it was gone from sight"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.489982,+-104.521967(42310)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42310) map </A>","City":"Gill","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-104.521967","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42310.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42310.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Gill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-09052012-0006","Date of the Event":"09/04/2012 08:30 UTC","Case Number":"42310","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"40.489982","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"09/05/2012 12:21 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Summary":"saw a ufo in gill co"}
