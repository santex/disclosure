It continued to sound in short blasts of first one, and then three \"trumpets.\" Each 'blast' lasted from 3-6 seconds and could be physicaly felt as well as heard, it also caused both of my cats to run and hide under my bed for the next half hour or so. It was kind of scary, i didnt see anything, i just stood there, transfixed by this unearthly booming. After about 3 minutes of these intermitent blasts it simply stopped."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44657.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in East Bridgewater","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
