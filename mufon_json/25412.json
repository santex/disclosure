I looked up and saw this very bright light (white) going by overhead, altitude about 3000 - 5000 feet or less, Object was taller than wide with no wings, it made no noise and had no strobe lights like a plane would have. I just stopped and watched this object going from west to ESE in the sky at a steady speed not very fast and not too slow. My wife came out on the porch and I told her to come look at this UFO. She laughed at first then she came down and we watched it go ESE then it sped up very fast and disappeared. The whole experience lasted less than 4 minutes. I am an avid photographer and go to many airshows. This was not an aircrat it made no noise, had no strobes and took off at a rate of speed I never witnessed. My house is in the country I see many satellites and planes go over heard at night and this was no plane. Note the planet Jupiter was just rising so it was not Jupiter."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"25412"}
