I went back in the house and got my camera and a pair of binoculars. The object was still there when I came back and it was moving slowly in a NE direction. I figured it was a weather balloon, but decided to watch it anyway. The sphere, or circle was white and had a glow. It moved slowly for another minute and then...stopped. The sphere remained stopped for about 15 minutes in the same spot, so I had plenty of time to get photos with my digital camera(I realized it could not be a balloon since the wind would have moved it along). The object was a few miles away so the shots were taken by using the zoom on my camera. There was no sound and the sphere appeared to be about 8,000 feet up. The object then moved slowly going south and out of distance."],"Case Number":"22303","Date Submitted":"03/15/2010 03:49 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"White Sphere","Date of the Event":"03/14/2010 04:10 UTC","City":"Pasadena","Weather Factors":"None"}
