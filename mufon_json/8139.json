(thinking it was my boss). tr: hello, you can call me tr, i am with the osir. paul: osir? as in the office of scientific investigation and research? tr: yes. are you still conducting the pre-investigation at mt. shasta? paul: yes, october 13. tr: where will you post your story first? paul: on the forum at hpi. tr: anywhere else? the hpi forum is not an open forum, will you post it at your own site jazma online!? paul: yes.tr: do you plan to fictionalize the story or are you reporting the story as truthful? paul: truthful...why? tr: if you and your team see anything of significance, we may be in contact with you, we may want to talk with you. are you okay with this? paul: sure. tr: thank you. paul: can i contact you while i am at the summit? tr: no, we will wait for your article, if needed we will contact you. paul: okay.tr: thank you, goodbye. paul: goodbye. as i looked back on my phone, the numbers were 0000 indicating a secure line from the government. i am aware of the 0000 because with a government job i had, i had to deal with the fbi all the time. when the fbi called, it was always 0000. if this is not the osir, then it is someone in the government that is curious on our findings. it could even be norad for all i know. the interesting thing is...why would mt. shasta have ufo cams on the mountain, if someone isn't really interested. osir in the ufo community is rumored to be government funded and some suspect the funds come from the cia. dan ankroyd in the 80s came out with a television called psi factor based on the activities of the osir. here is the official osir website: http:\\\\www.osironline.org\\to better understand the osir, which for the longest time was a covert agency, which recently went overt and then back to covert status, see this article:http:\\\\www.unexplained-mysteries.com\\viewnews.php?id=65179i believe the osir website that we now see, which is overt is actually a group of people who have taken on the name osir and they are not the real osir, but of course this is my opinion. i later learn from paranormal investigator chris grissom, that this telephone call could have been hoaxed and the 0 numbers could have been done by telephone spoofing. rats! i thought i had the real men in black after me! like jim phelps of mission impossible's i.m. force, i am going over the bios, profiles and photos of some of the hpi paranormal investigators and i am amazed at the variety of members we have in hpi with very interesting backgrounds. holly delaughter's ex-father in law is country music hall of famer hollis r. 'red lane\" delaughter. donna reynolds is a witch of the sacred fire circle and going through her emails, she tells me that i should check out their festivals and write an article, she goes into details to tell me the upcoming festivals they are having, like: dark moon circle on wednesday, october 10, 2007; full moon circle on 10\\26; wanda's autumn bazaar at her shop in elk grove on 10\\27; an all-hallow's eve event at her shop on 10\\31; and their samhain celebration on 11\\10. donna at the last minute had to cancel, due to some serious issues she needed to take care of. we do have some interesting 'characters' in hpi. now to the pre-investigation at hand. the date is october 13, 2007, saturday. roll call for paranormal investigators\\ufologists\\cryptozoologists: paul dale roberts, lead investigator\\scout, michele stump\\researcher, chris grissom\\technician, nicole rae pollard, holly delaughter\\psychic, kelley tuttle\\guide\\psychic, bruce roseberry\\guide, glennis roseberry\\guide\\mt. shasta historian, hanako zeidenberg. the reason why i gave us all titles of ufologists and cryptozoologists, because we all earned our merits for being a cryptozoologist by tracking bigfoot and a ufologist by ufo skywatching this night. let's talk about the history of this magic mountain, we all know as mount shasta:mount shasta was formerly known as strawberry valley, berryvale and sisson. a long history of mythology surrounds the mountain, including legends of lemurians, atlanteans, secret commonwealth citizens, dwarfs, fairies, bigfoot, and space beings who materialize at will. the indians believed mt. shasta was a portal to other dimensions. bigfoot of course is associated with ufos and is considered an interdimensional being, that can walk into this reality and his own dimensional reality at will. mt. shasta is a very special place to say the least; it represents much more than just a mere mountain. mt. shasta can be considered as one of the most sacred places on this planet. the mountain is a mystic power source for this planet. some people theorize that it is connected to a leyline, similar to stonehenge in england. it is a focus for angels, spirit-guides, spaceships, masters from the light realm, wicca and the home of the survivors of ancient lemuria, which sank under the waves of the pacific ocean a little over 12,000 years ago. the last of the lemurians and some believe the last of the atlanteans (of atlantis) retreated to underground caverns in this sacred mountain. people who have been in the caverns, claim to hear the sound of machinery. in the 1930s, little people with bags of gold would come out of the caverns and trade their gold for goods provided by the farmers. for those gifted with clairvoyant abilities, mt. shasta is embraced in a gigantic, etheric purple pyramid whose capstone reaches far beyond this planet into space, and connects us intergalactically to the confederation of planets for this sector of the milky way galaxy. this awesome pyramid is also created as an inverted version of itself, reaching far down to the very core of the earth. you can call mt. shasta the entry point of the light-grids of this planet, where most of the energy comes first from the galactic and universal core before it is disseminated to other mountains and into the grids. most mountaintops, especially tall mountains, are beacons of light, feeding the light-grids of this planet. strange lights and sounds are often seen or heard on the mountain. lenticular clouds, shadows and outstanding sunsets add to the mystical aura of the mountain. several tunnels stretch far into the interior of this majestic mountain. people come here to seek out the present-day lemurians, survivors of the sinking of the continent of mu. yes, our lemurian brothers and sisters are real; they are well and physically alive, living in the subterranean city of \"telos\" beneath mount shasta, so legend has it! the lemurians, atlanteans were a highly evolved race of people, that surpass our own living styles with their advanced technology. many people believe that these ancient civilizations were visited by the gods (extraterrestrials). prior to the sinking of their continent, fully aware of the eventual destiny of their beloved continent, the ancient lemurians, using their mastery of energy, crystals, sound and vibrations, hollowed out a vast underground city, with the intention of preserving their culture, their treasures, and their records of ancient earth's history; history that has been lost since the sinking of atlantis. lemuria was once a vast continent, and larger than north america, connected to parts of california, oregon, nevada and washington. this large continent disappeared overnight into the pacific ocean over 12,000 years ago in a vast cataclysm. all inhabitants of the earth at that time considered lemuria, the land of mu, their motherland, and there was much weeping on the earth when that happened. about 25,000 lemurians at that time were able to migrate into the interior of mt. shasta, the most important of their various administration centers, prior to the sinking of their motherland. they are still here in tangible, physical, immortal bodies, totally unlimited, living a life of pure heaven on earth. american indians believed that mt. shasta was of such immense grandeur, that its existence could only be attributed to the creation of a very \"great spirit\". they also believed that an invisible race of little people, about four feet tall, lived along its slopes as guardians. these wondrous little people, often referred to as \"the little people of mt. shasta\", are also kind of physical, but not quite, and they are very often seen visually around the mountain. they are third dimensional beings like humans, but they live on a slightly higher level of the third dimension, such as third and one half level, and they have the ability to make themselves visible and invisible at will. i think i explained enough about the history. now let's talk about this pre-investigation to this sacred mountain. 07:30 hours: chris grissom & michele stump arrive at my doorstep. we pack up my vehicle 'ghosttracker' and hit i-5 north towards redding. we arrive at starbucks at 1400 eureka way for a briefing at 1300 hours. i explain to them the history of mt. shasta and the purpose of our investigation. the reason for our investigation is merely to seek the truth. kelley tuttle, a resident of redding, discusses other information about mt. shasta to the team and will guide us to the campground, being prepared by bruce & glennis roseberry. kelley who was very enthusiastic uses white shoe polish and writes on the three vehicles heading to mt. shasta 'hpi paranormal' across the back windows. the mib won't have a hard time spotting us out. kelley equips each driver of the three vehicles with walkie talkies. we convoy up to the campsite with kelley leading. during the whole stretch everyone is talking on the walkie talkies about this and that in regard to mount shasta. i glance down at the book holly loaned me called 'the lost civilization of lemuria - the rise and fall of the world's oldest culture by frank joseph.' michele stump, our historian\\researcher doesn't waste time going through the contents of this book. as we head up the mountain, there was one black government type of vehicle going down the opposite way. the woman in the car, wore dark sunglasses and a suit with black tie. what was odd is i am going up towards the mountain and she is going down the mountain and our eyes connected as we passed. well, it just seemed odd. after that odd glance with the possible mib, we chatted more on the walkie talkies and talked about how the weather gods were on my side. the skies were very clear and it was a warm day. there were many naysayers that thought this day would be cloudy and rainy. it rained hard on friday, but i did a general george s. patton prayer for good weather and it worked! i also told everyone how i stopped in the small town at arbuckle and i was waiting forever for this pick-up to move and finally gave up and crossed over. i look back and a colusa county sheriff pulled me over. he said i didn't yield. i explained politely the situation and he ran my plates and let me go. whew! besides the walkie talkie chatter, i had to listen to michele and chris argue about the 49ers and the cowboys. michele had her 49er jersey on and chris had his cowboy jersey on. we met up with bruce and glennis at black bear restaurant and bruce and glennis lead the convoy to the campsite. it was a perfect campsite, we had a clear view of mount shasta and the open sky. i went over the equipment that was assigned to everyone. let's go over it here: paul: listen up sound enhancer, police band walkie talkie (not used), cell phone, digital camera, binoculars, 2 flashlights, 1 red laser light. note: laser lights and flashlights are to signal ufos, some ufo groups use this method to signal ufos and they in turn signal back. i signaled the morse code for 'hello'. holly & nicole: 2 digital cameras, emf detector, 2 cellphones, 2 listen up sound enhancers, 2 laser pen lights, audio digital recorder, video camera, telephoto lens (cannon & rebel cameras), dowsing rods, video camera, 2 flashlights. note: nicole became a spotter for bigfoot using binoculars. hanoko: digital camera, cell phone, tent, sleeping bag. note: hanoko became a spotter for the group surveying the hills with binoculars. michele: tent, digital camera, cell phone, binoculars, telescope, night scope. glennis: digital camera, cell phone, 2 sets of binoculars, tent. chris: flashlight, cell phone.kelley: tent, emf gauge detector, retracting telescope, digital camera, binoculars, digital audio recorder. as we set up tents, gathered rocks for a makeshift fire site, i looked upon the hillside and saw a long-haired topless woman moving about frantically. i instantly thought, could this be a lovely nordic alien woman moving about the bushes? i had to go up and investigate. it was actually nicole, with her long lady godiva hair, she threw off her top because she ran into a nest of wasps. she actually got stung 15 times. she was like a champ and after i took out the wasps out of her hair, she continued to assist everyone in gathering firewood. while we still had daylight, we did a bigfoot scouting mission. our objective is to gather any bigfoot hair or dung samples. we were to look for any bigfoot nesting area and try and locate some bigfoot footprints in the mud, in which we would have took photos of the footprints and placed plaster of paris around the footprint for analysis. the spotters were nicole & michele for this scouting mission, both using high-powered binoculars. during this mission, i was also looking for angel hair (associated with ufos. ufos are known to deposit angel hair that is almost like a spider's web. it disintegrates quickly - no angel hair found). as night fell, everyone shared snacks and beverages. i brought cheese, ham, ritz crackers, cheez-its, pepsi. kelley treated us to apple streudel pastry. other members brought a variety of snacks to munch on, as we prepared the telescopes for observation of mount shasta and the open night skies. during this night sky watch, we signaled the skies with our laser pen lights and high-powered flashlights. signaling ufos was not successful, we did not obtain any signals back. during this ufo investigation, i had hanoko drive the ghost tracker (i was tired of driving) to the local store for necessities for the group. after driving around in the pitch darkness for a good long while, we decided to go back, before we got lost. it's amazing how all of the streets look the same in the deep woods of this alpine forest. hanoko was having a good time, this was her very first ufo\\bigfoot investigation and we talked about how we first arrived i threw on some halloween music 'thriller by michael jackson' and finally some rick james. when another camping party told us if we can turn down the music, i said to everyone���.'oops! that brought me back to reality, i remember we need to do a serious investigation up here', as i turned down the music. hanoko and i, never did find that store. we had a couple of mishaps that we now look back at and laugh. i am reminded by this team, that whatever happens in mt. shasta, stays in mt. shasta! so, i will not disclose those hilarious mishaps. most of the group stayed up most of the night, i had a whistle, so in case anyone fell asleep, i was going to blow my whistle and wake up the group if i saw a ufo during 3am to 5am. guess what? i fell asleep, i was so disappointed in myself, that i could not stay up for that long. i literally passed out in my car, it must be that high altitude. this was an exciting pre-investigation and the whole team had felt like family. michele felt a spiritual connection to this mountain. i was saddened that michele lost her $900.00 wedding ring at this campsite. she lost it by taking off her gloves. in the morning time, we looked and looked and it was nowhere to be found. i made contact with shannon 'ms. macabre' mccabe, president of h.p.i. and told her about our findings, i placed her on speaker phone as she talked with this group. unfortunately, we did not capture an alien 'gray' and hogtie it for positive proof that aliens do exist, nor did we gather any dung samples to place on shannon's doorstep the next day. none of us received an anal probe either. after i told shannon about my findings���she could only say one thing���'rock and roll!' it was nice sitting around the campfire, telling jokes, talking about the legends of mt. shasta. glennis and bruce who frequently visit mount shasta, had so many historical insights about this magic mountain. glennis explained to us how a group of indians were massacred near and around mount shasta and that perhaps there is a lot of residual haunting activity at this location. i thank the guides, kelley for leading us to the campsite and glennis and bruce for preparing the campsite for us! we could have not done this mission, without their assistance. i thought to myself, since people claim to see lemurians, dwarfs, aliens and fairies, couldn't all of these creatures be the same thing. they are all described as being small people. could fairy circles be the equivalent of crop circles or ufo landing sites? hmmm. the only tall creatures that exist near mount shasta are the nordics which are compared to as angels, because they are tall, pale and have long blonde hair. then there is bigfoot, which is supposingly 10 to 12 feet in height. in the morning, as we all were about to head out, nicole and holly said they were having breakfast with glennis and bruce at the black bear restaurant and were going to drive up the mountain towards the caverns sunday morning before heading home. we cleaned up the campsite and everyone gave each other a farewell hug and discussed future scouting missions to places like whiskey hill in redding and some other haunted sites. since i was tired, i let one more person have the honors of driving the ghost tracker home. i let chris drive the ghost tracker home as i took a power nap. chris drove himself home and then i drove michele back to my house to retrieve her car and she was heading home with a million errands to do. on our way back, we got a call from hanoko, she left her sleeping bag in my trunk and we were able to pull off the side of the road, where she was waiting for us to get her sleeping bag. thank goodness for cellular phones! the next time we investigate mount shasta will be next summer and we're bringing a bigger team up with us! findings: paul: using binoculars spies a large animal behind a tree. could be a large deer. i saw a fast moving object (bright light) shoot straight up from the horizon near mount shasta and disappear. many of the team members were able to see the billions of billions of stars in the night skies, the milky way, the big dipper and satellites moving across the night sky. the night sky was gorgeous. kelley: her psychic abilities causes her to feel dread at a hollow out tree. later on this evening, she spotted what she thought was a ufo, fast moving object that disappears as fast as it appeared. object appeared as a star. her emf meter went off on its own during the bigfoot scouting mission. holly: feels a presence further up the hill during the bigfoot scouting mission. hanoko: spots 2 ufos in the night skies using binoculars. they moved swiftly in a linear pattern. both ufos moved swiftly from point a to point b and vanished. both ufos are separate incidents. bruce: spots one ufo, didn't get full information on his sighting. bigfoot scouting mission: scouts: nicole, holly, hanoko, paul, kelley, michele. headquarters with walkie talkie was chris grissom. three scouts hear strange shrieking cry from their listen up devices. bigfoot is known to make screeching sounds. no dung samples obtained, the closest dung sample was deer dung and i wasn't about to pick that up! one location of our scouting expedition, we discovered no birds chirping, which we thought was unusual. it has been said that if bigfoot is nearby, birds will stop chirping. holly feels that there is a presence further up the hill, but we decide to turn back before it gets too dark. we also heard a loud rustling noise, but that could have been a large mammal. now as i close this article, i want to mention i received a nice email from tommy netzband of the san francisco haunted haight walking tour and he thanked us for tagging along on his tour and enjoyed the article i wrote about his tour. it was a pleasure tommy!
