At 6:10 Pacific time, I observed a unidentifed craft, in what s still daylight, fly over Almadan vally in San Jose. It had four lights, positioned like on the tips of a dimonand, 2 of them which were blinking several colors. It slowly crused across the sky, making a \"looooooooo\" sound as it zoomed away from me.
