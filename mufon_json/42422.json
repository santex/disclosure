{"Object Features":"None","Country":"Canada","City":"Newcastle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving into a McDonalds parking lot tonight and yelled at my mom to stop. We looked at the light and i kinda freak out in excitement because I saw it again but as we turned to each other thinking wtf and look back after a second it vanished and when i say a second it was litterly like a slow blink that quick. I have seen these hovering lights about 4 or 5 times this year this is the second time it has quickly disappeared into thin air after spotting it and looking away for a quick second. the other times i have spotted one of these it would slowly hover upwards into the sky and a very bright light and slowly became a very dull small light and disappears and then i saw flashing lights like airplanes but were flying a lot faster than an actual airplane. this is weird and i thought i was crazy and seeing this but its happened so many times this year."],"Region":"Ontario","Date of the Event":"09/09/2012 09:55 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"CA-09092012-0024","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Newcastle","There were no other sightings in Newcastle on or around September 9th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42422.html"],"Summary":"big yellowy white bright light in the sky hovering and then looked away for about 2 seconds and it was no where to be seen.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"42422","Longitude":"-78.591936","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.907234,+-78.591936(42422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42422) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.907234","Date Submitted":"09/09/2012 11:26 UTC"}
