I looked up at the sky directly above me and it looked like a giant star was zig-zagging across the sky. it flew in a south east direction towards the moon in a zig zag pattern. When it appeared to be directly in front of the moon it began to descend then abruptly disappeared. The object was far brighter than any star i have ever seen and stood out next to the moon. My father also witnessed the object. This was no comet or meteor. It was no plane or helicopter or balloon. The object moved way to fast and flew way to high to be anything of the sort."],"Tags":"City","Region":"North Carolina","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Yadkinville","There were no other sightings in Yadkinville on or around June 10th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.744637","Date of the Event":"06/10/2012 04:15 UTC","Latitude":"36.102144","City":"Yadkinville","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06102012-0030","Summary":"Bright object that looked like a very large star.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.102144,+-80.744637(39120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39120) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/10/2012 05:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
