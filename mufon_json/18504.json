It looked to my wife and I as if it was something burning up on reentry. The first part broke into 5 or so pieces rather bright lasting around 30 seconds. The second part was a single glow that was much brighter. The altitude and angle of the object was extremely distant and high. The color was a bright orange like shade. The event occurred about a hands distance from the moon and Venus to the south at about 3 o'clock visually (if you were to hold your hand about 1 foot from your eyes)."],"Case Number":"18504","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Looked like something burning up reentering the atmosphere in 2 seperate visuals.","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/05/2009 08:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.94847,+-104.678319(18504)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18504) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Santa Rosa","There were no other sightings in Santa Rosa on or around August 5th 2009"],"City":"Santa Rosa","Date Submitted":"08/05/2009 08:45 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18504.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18504.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-104.678319","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New Mexico","Object Shape":"Circle"}
