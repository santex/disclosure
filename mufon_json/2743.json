It had the same color and intensity of a star. We saw it descend from the edge of the atmosphere looking towards the northeast. It moved downward for almost a minute before it turned at about 90 degrees and headed back out of the sky accelerating as it left. It looked like a ball of white light but it seemed to move in a coordinated manner. We stood there and watched in amazement not sure of what it was that we were seeing. I am still unsure. I think that if a being or person were inside it, as it was a solid object, they would have been killed by the rapid change of direction it made. It seemed to defy gravity and not to have the limitations of flight that known manmade objects possess."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Indiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2743.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2743.html"],"City":"Argos","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Argos","There were no other sightings in Argos on or around August 1st 2000"],"Longitude":"-86.241463","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
