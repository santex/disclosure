{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were camping in Big Thicket on the Turkey Creek Trail. We were laying on the ground looking up into the sky while there was plenty of daylight left. There were no clouds in the sky so we could see very clearly. As we were looking up we saw a red neon boomerang appear and disappear maybe 5 times in a southern direction. It was traveling from the North. We were on the southern half of the trail a couple miles shy of the halfway mark. I have no idea what it was but I know that I have never seen anything like it."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20141.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20141.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"20141","Region":"Texas","City":"Big Thicket National Pres","Date Submitted":"10/26/2009 02:13 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/23/2009 06:00 UTC","Latitude":"31.976169","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.976169,+-99.900493(20141)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20141) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"solid neon red boomerang","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10262009-0010","Longitude":"-99.900493","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Big Thicket National Pres","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
