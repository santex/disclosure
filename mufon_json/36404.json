At first i thought that these was just two stars,it made me wonder and look at them more because i never seen this star cluster before and as i watch them for about 15 mins the began fading in out from bright white to light blue one at 1st then the other. they faded out came back and about a two mins later one faded out followed by the other. I never seen them again and i still look for some kind of star like objects like that every time i go out to smoke at work. they never been seen again. at fist glance my feeling was wow look at them two bright stars never seen them before and as i was smoking and watching them fading in and out i was like what is this,i thought maybe some kind of flare or something but they were not moving or decending just in the same spot all the time until they just faded away."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"two star like objects fading in and out then just faded out and was gone one faded out very slow at first than came back then about 15 mins late they both faded out one first than the other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.275108,+-76.56078(36404)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36404) map </A>","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Baltimore","There were no other sightings in Baltimore on or around December 5th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Maryland","Country":"United States"}
