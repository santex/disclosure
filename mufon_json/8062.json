While sitting on the porch of a 10-story building we saw a great big green light that is ircular shaped. We stared and told everyone on the porch. we all looked at the green circle until it swooped down very fast towards the ground leaving a trail of light, that wasn't a fading trail, but a distinct trail, that gave you the effect of a slideshow of pictures. We were all very impressed and haven't stopped talking about our experience since. _J.R.
