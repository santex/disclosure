Morelos. We were having dinner when my neighbor saw this light that seemed bigger than a plane and moving faster. He was just looking at the sky to see if he could see any stars and he noticed the red light moving. At first we thought it was an airplane. The light was at first moving fast and suddenly stopped for a few seconds and then just kept moving, clearly visible. Some of us were excited to see this thing but my uncle was actually scared, we tried to filmed it but we think that it isn't able to see because of the distance. The object flew upwards after gaining altitude and kept moving until it was out of sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Cuernavaca","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"18.855919","Longitude":"-99.228798","Summary":"We saw a red-orange circular light moving faster than a plane and suddenly stoped and after 30 secs started moving again.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.855919,+-99.228798(34859)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34859) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
