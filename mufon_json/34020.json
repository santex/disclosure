Last night on December 13th, 2011, I noticed police lights out my window. I went to the front porch to get a better look. There was a flat bed truck with a very large craft on the bed. It was entirely shrinkwrapped so that you couldn't see what was underneath. There were approximately 10-12 highway patrol in the back and the front of this truck blocking off the road. The news that evening stated that it was a drone for the Navy. I am very familiar with all of our military drones and this craft looks like nothing that is of public knowledge. It had no wings, like all of our drones do. It was shaped just like a disc, and was stablized with bars that were also shrink wrapped so it would stay on the truck. In my opinion, who ever issued the statement made a mistake. Because saying that it is a drone, ackknowledges that it flies and to my knowledge our military has no craft like this that flies. I have 3 pictures of the craft, from various angles."],"Date Submitted":"12/14/2011 05:46 UTC","Summary":"Parked in front of my house on a flat bed truck (saucer shaped craft).","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-12142011-0005","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Webb City","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"City":"Webb City","Case Number":"34020","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/13/2011 08:00 UTC"}
