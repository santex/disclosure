{"Summary":"polygon shaped w/ lights","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.990333","Case Number":"5108","divs":["Sighting DetailsUpon getting the camera for a picture of the moon, hanging low in the southwest that evening, I noticed a strange light hovering about 2 o clock from the moon. Barely floating within a sphere with a diameter of a centimeter from where I was watching from my deck. It hovered there for about 10 minutes, then it moved in a southwest diagonal direction and then did a sharp, quick, left pointing check mark movement heading upwards at a 45 degree angle fading out quickly like a shooting star. I thought it was a star or plane at first, but immediately could tell that it was neither. I guess bewilderment as to what it was was what I felt. Then I wondered if it would come out with the digital camera, Sony DSC P-30. The first shot was taken at 1:11 am, the second at 1:18 am, and the moon shot was taken at 1:24 am. Then I ran down to get my sig other, excited as to what I saw, but she wouldn't wake up."],"Date of the Event":"04/08/2006 01:09 UTC","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Santa Cruz","There were no other sightings in Santa Cruz on or around April 8th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Santa Cruz","Log Number":"US-07192006-0002","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-122.058601","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.990333,+-122.058601(5108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5108) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/08/2006 01:09 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5108.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/5108_submitter_file1__DSC01797.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/5108_submitter_file2__DSC01806.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/5108_submitter_file3__DSC01813.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5108.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other"}
