It was pretty dark outside and I was heading home. I was making a turn and when I looked both ways I did a double take because I saw something weird and I thought it was a streetlight. It was an orange-ish fireball ascending into the sky. It got dimmer and turned into a single ball of light. I was freaking out and I called my friend to tell her what I saw and while I was talking to her the object jumped to the other side of the sky in an instant. It was a fireball like before and when it dimmed, it looked like three horizontal lights and it shot off into the sky."],"Disposition":"Hoax","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26477.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26477.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/09/2010 10:39 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hartland","There were no other sightings in Hartland on or around November 9th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Cigar, Fireball","Longitude":"-83.754382","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/09/2010 06:20 UTC","Summary":"Fireball Ascends Into the Sky.","City":"Hartland","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
