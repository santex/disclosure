We both noticed the object about the same time and stated \"what is that?\". I look to the night sky often and familiar with most activity in our area. This was not a normal sighting. Typically I would have chalked it up as a plane, however this did not have the characteristics with respect to the orange glow and lack of sound. It moved from the east toward the west at what seemed to be a normal flight speed. The oddity was the large glow aspect giving the object a round shape. When I realized it was something unusual, I called out to my son to bring his camera. We attempted some shots, not the best, but we weren't expecting to see something. We watched it for about 3 minutes and then it was no longer in our sight."]}
