I then go back to the kitchen to get my second cup of coffee and return outside to the balcony. I sat the cup down and proceeded to light a smoke, and I simultaneously looked up and saw a large 8��� bubble or sphere hanging suspended above and behind the pine trees in front of me. It must have been as close as fifty or sixty feet, and it looked to be maybe 35 feet high in the air���just hanging there. My first thought was��� who else is seeing this thing. I couldn���t do anything but just sit there. I truly felt like a ���deer in the headlights.��� I was almost too shocked to react. I was amazed at how I could see the pine tree branches reflecting on the surface of this thing. It looked like an 8 ft. version of a silver garden wishing ball. I remember thinking that if I move��� this thing will probably take off. I could feel my heart pounding, but it was almost a mesmerizing and fearful feeling to just look at this thing. There was no recollection of noises during this event, and I don���t recall much other than being confounded by it���s abrupt appearance. Anyway, I last remember seeing it start to rise up and past the top of the overhang. I didn���t get up to follow it path upward���.I just sat there. Later, I remember thinking how atypical this was of my normal reaction to any chance at such an event. I���m not even sure how long I sat there afterwards thinking about it. I was really shocked that it was just suddenly there, because Kim and I both were there just minutes earlier. Then I got up��� went inside��� looked at the stove-clock and it said 8:45 am. I took a shower and busied myself trying not to think about what happened, but I just couldn���t stop thinking about it��� all day. I firmly believe that my action of late night vigils, along with instigating some form of interaction ���may be the cause of this encounter. If anyone has seen this object or anything similar...PLEASE contact me thru MUFON!
