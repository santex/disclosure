Later around 11:20 another very bright and large ball of white light closer than other ones moved south to north this one was different because the white light turned on and off for about four or five seconds each time,I pointed a laser at it and every time it shined brighter and brighter it blinked about five times and stopped blinking and i lost sight of it since i didn't know where exactly it went after that it didn't emit any more light but also moved south to north. I couldn't get my iphone to take a picture or record since it was to dark."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/16/2011 02:26 UTC","Log Number":"US-06162011-0004","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Multiple balls of light","Case Number":"29576","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/15/2011 11:07 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.882204,+-87.627798(29576)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29576) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.627798","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
