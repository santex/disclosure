I'm not really a time-concious person, but there were a couple times when I think I may have been abducted. Just the other night, I woke suddenly and thought I heard a strange buzzing noise, then decided it must have been a dream. Then I noticed the compact florescent light bulb was glowing slightly, like they do after you shut one off or shine a light on it. I was disoreinted just enough that the glow from it seemed to be moving. It gave me the creeps, and I'm a country boy, not afraid of the dark. Several years ago, I was followed or chased by a light from the sky while driving, and seemed to lose part of my memory. I remember vividly looking in my mirror at the light in a certain area, then my next memory is driving the opposite direction in a different area. I had no idea what time it was, so I can't say if there was missing time or not. I'm writing to ask what it takes and how much it costs to be regressed so I can find out what's been going on. I'd appreciate any advice you can give."],"Log Number":"US-04272010-0003","Date of the Event":"04/25/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"St Maries","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St Maries","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Idaho","Summary":"Possible abduction; previous UFO activity.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.314722,+-116.570556(22984)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22984) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/27/2010 02:06 UTC","Case Number":"22984","Longitude":"-116.570556"}
