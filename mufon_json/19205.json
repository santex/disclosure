I happened to look up to see 2 bright lights in a line with a dark narrow object in between, it was very hard to see and very thin aprox 250' in length. I watched it for 2 or 3 minutes as it crossed the river from Illinois into Iowa then overhead. It stayed on the same path which would be sw to ne. The thing that caught my eye was there were no strobe lights or red and green nav lights, only bright white lights at the front and back. It was maybe at 1000 ft. and made absolutely no noise. AS it moved the tailing light would move to the right 20 degrees back to center for awhile and move 20 degrees to the left. It left my sight at a high rate of speed as it moved up and over the hill to my northeast. When it was overhead it made me a little apprehensive and the dog acted a little strange wanting to head towards the house up the street."],"Latitude":"41.569333","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19205.html"],"Case Number":"19205","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.569333,+-90.467712(19205)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19205) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bettendorf","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date Submitted":"09/09/2009 11:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-90.467712","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Bettendorf","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"2 bright lights aprox.250' long first light stationary 2nd moving side to side at times"}
