I looked outside and saw the jet insanely low making a sharp turn toward NYC .. As for what I witnessed earlier... Driving home south on the garden state parkway (exit158)I happened to be looking East when a blue green streak came out of nowhere and shot on a vertical ellipse leaving a streak across the sky. It must of been a total of 3 seconds. I was so taken back I stopped talking to a friend who I was on the phone with. Not a shooting star or a meteor shower ...nothing like it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.956411,+-74.072174(37423)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37423) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"37423","Date of the Event":"04/12/2012 08:20 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Paramus","There were no other sightings in Paramus on or around April 12th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Blue Green Streak in the sky near Paramus NJ..","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Paramus","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37423.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/12/2012 11:47 UTC","Longitude":"-74.072174"}
