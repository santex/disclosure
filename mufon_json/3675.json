{"Region":"Manitoba","divs":["sighting detailsa friend of mine and his little girl of nine years were standing on the corner of henderson highway and hespeler in winnipeg manitoba on july 25\\2005 at seven ten p.m. there are basketball hoops located on this corner and cement walls around adjacent to the hoops.my friends little girl named shelby was watching the sky when she asked us what she was looking at up in the sky.when we looked up into the sky there was a cloud cover above us with what at first seemed to be a bird flying at high altitude just beneath the clouds.as we observed this object we noticed that it was blinking and remaining stationary.the object then started moving in the in a north easterly direction when all of a sudden another blinking light popped out of the clouds and caught up to the other blinking light and together they flew into the clouds above them.the reason i am reporting this is because of what happened next.after they flew into the clouds we turned to leave the lot we were observing this phenomena from.as we turned to leave something caught my peripheral vision and i turned quickly towards this while pointing at and yelling at my friend and his daughter.there was a silouette of a craft gliding behind the trees and it glided right into an opening in the trees . i am still freaking out about we saw in the clearing. there was a ufo hovering above some houses observing my friend , myself and his child.we are still not sure how long this craft hovered in front of us or whether any other citizens of winnipeg witnessed what we did .the corner where occurred is one of the busiest areas of the city.this is located right at the foot of the disraeli freeway,so my frind and i have discussing this since it happened.as we were observing this craft right in front of us it suddenly got very bright and the craft was gone in the blink of an eye.my friend, myself, and his child then proceeded to leave this area and headed for home.as we were riding our bikes away from this event i asked my friend what time it was and he answered seven fourty eight.we were standing there observing this thing for thirty six minutes.from the time that we stood there and pointed at this object till the the time that it shot down from the sky and attempted to hide behind the trees,only about two or three minutes elapsed.this would have made the sighting of the craft in the clearing at approx. seven thirteen p.m. since i walked onto the lot at seven ten p.m.this all happened very quickly yet seemed to take a long time. we were feeling very disoriented as we headed for home. i am willing to take any lie detector test to prove what i experienced was real.so are my friend and his daughter. we are quite sure that what we experienced was quite real because we all describe the same saucer shaped object with a bottom that is sort of shaped light a chestnut.this craft hovered over some houses in one the busiest intersection in winnipeg so i cannot believe that we were the only witnesses,at least i hope we are not.what the hell is going on . we were about two hundred feet from this craft as it hovered over the houses.went back to this location to study our vantage point when we sighted this craft over these houses.it would be impossible for the whole neighborhood not to see something like this.our question is why didn't anybody else notice what should have been front page news. i have not been feeling normal since this happened on july 28\\2005 -seven ten p.m."],"Case Number":"3675","Log Number":"CA-08022005-0021","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.901574,+-97.132294(3675)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3675) map </A>","Summary":"myself,a friend and his daughter witnessed two blinking lights in the sky,which flew into the clouds.One of these craft shot to earth at a high rate of speed and attempted to conceal itself among the trees.We all saw it when appeared in a clearing .","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Winnipeg","There were 3 other sightings in Winnipeg on or around July 28th 2005"],"Date Submitted":"07/28/2005 07:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"49.901574","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Winnipeg","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3675.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3675.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/28/2005 07:10 UTC","Longitude":"-97.132294","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
