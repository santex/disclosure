{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my deck at my apartment and I was looking up at the sky and watching planes and helicopters fly around and make landings at the various airports in the area. I looked up above the tree line and a pulsating white light that was up in the sky. I noticed that everytime that it pulsated it was in a different location in the sky. It was going every which way everytime it would light up again. I continued to watch for about 5 minutes and then it was gone. It was showing up in all different directions and was moving from place to place to fast to be a conventional aircraft from my point of view. Don't know what it was but it was interesting."],"Log Number":"US-05052008-0003","Region":"Washington","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10665.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10665.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10665.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.61411,+-122.323441(10665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10665) map </A>","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around May 5th 2008"],"Case Number":"10665","Date of the Event":"05/05/2008 09:29 UTC","Latitude":"47.61411","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"05/05/2008 09:29 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Pulsating white light high in sky.
