lane that led out into the middle of a cornfield. there were approximately 10-12 people out there. i was standing with two other people talking to them and happened to look up in the sky and noticed a bright white light that was stationary. it was a clear summer night and visibility was excellent. i observed the light for a few minutes and notices that it began to change colors in almost a strobing pattern while still remaining stationary. the object flashed from white to green to red and to blue. the other people noticed this as well. there were no other stars in the sky or any other aircraft either. we watched this object remain stationary and change colors for approximate fifteen minutes or so. a friend of ours needed a ride to his home in peoria and asked if i could take him there. i agreed to and he and i and my younger brother and another friend got into my vehicle to leave for peoria. i was driving,the guy who was going to peoria was in the front seat, and my brother and his friend were in the back. as we left the area where everyone was congregated, we started driving down the farmer's lane towards eden rd. the farmer's lane was approximately 1\\8 of a mile long until it reached eden rd. we had gone several hundred feet when all of a sudden my brother and his friend started screaming about something coming after us. my brother started crying(literally) and yelling \"please don't let them get us!\". they both were freaking out and were extremely distraught. i became a little frightened as well and i saw in the rearview mirror they were both looking at and pointing at the sky on the driver's side of the car. i looked out in the sky and approximately 300 ft. away and about 250 to 300 ft. in the air i saw a huge object in the sky. we had our windows down due it being a nice summer out and this object made no sound at all. it was parallel to the vehicle and following us silently. the object was as large as a farmhouse if not bigger, and was diamond shaped and was a dark color. there were whites that were kind of distorted near the bottom of the object and it appeared that were almost porthole like windows with white lights emanating from them that were encircling the object near the center of it. we were probably traveling at about 10 to 15 mph at this time and when i saw the object i hit the gas and began going very fast to about 45 mph. we were flying down this grass farmer's lane which was very bumpy as well. the object kept up with us and stayed paralle to the car and continued to make no sound at all. we finally got to eden rd. and when we need i made fast hard right onto eden rd. because this led to highway 116 which we were going to take into peoria. when we made this hard right, the object made a sharp fast ninety degree turn as well and with no sound. it was a short distance to 116 and the object went higher into the sky. i sped down eden and when i got to 116 i blew through the stop sign due to no traffic as i made another sharp fast turn onto 116. as we go onto 116 and sped towards hanna city the object had gone out of our view. i then saw the object come over the top of the car and shoot off into the sky at a very high rate of speed. we followed its path into the sky and it went very far out and high into the sky and then appeared to stop again and once again resembled the extremely bright white light that i had orginally witnessed at the beginning of this encounter. i told them to keep an eye on it and i did as well and as we drove the approximately 8 miles into peoria to my friend's house it followed us all the way there but remained the bright white light. all of us were extremely shaken up and could not believe what we had just experienced. i dropped my friend off and we decided to take a back route back to the farmer's lane on eden rd. we got onto route 8, which is a dark, untraveled road at that time of night. we still saw the bright object in the sky as we made our way back. as we continued on, near resevoir blvd., i saw someone walking alongside the road. i slowed down and crept past and we noticed that it was someone we knew, our friend winston who lived about five miles away and had no reason to be out there around 12 or so at night on a desolate country road. we pulled over and asked him what he was doing and he appeared very disoriented and was acting very weird. he got into the car and we proceeded on our way. he said that he had this compelling impulse to just leave his father's house and to make his way to that area and that he had even taken a bike from a yard to make his way over there. he said he didnt know why he did but he just felt like he had to. he also mentioned that he was scared while he was by himself and that he felt like there was something in the woods following him and watching him. we told him our story and as we finally made it back to the farmer's lane the light was still there. when we got back, everyone was surprised to see winston and saw how excited we were. i told them the story and then pointed out to them the stationary bright white light in the sky and told them it had followed us back. a friend of ours said thats a just a star and we didnt know what we were talking about. as we watched the object for a few minutes, it began to slowly move and then accelerated off into the night sky and disapppeared and we never saw it again that night. i looked at the person who had doubted us and said \"oh yea, thats really a star huh?\" what we saw that night i have never seen anything like it and do not know of any aircraft or objects that are man-made that could possibly explain what this was. i am college educated and a reasonable and sensible person as well. i have seen other lights in that area over the year that resemble what we saw that night but never have i seen anything as close as we did that night. if you have any questions or need addtional information please feel free to contact me at your convenience. i have told this story to many people throughout the years since this incident occurred and i now feel like this is important enough to be shared with so maybe it can be explained or help somehow. i have seen other reports of sightings that have matched what i saw since i had that encounter and it leads me to believe these could be similar objects. thank you for your time in reading this report and i hope it is detailed enough so that it may be of some assistance to you. thank you,"],"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"40.691704","Object Flight
