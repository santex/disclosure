I had recently talked to my mom about the difference in contrails and chemtrails. Told her what I had learned. Well one day she noticed in the sky 3 very long and large chemtrails and just so happened to be an airplane in the distance demostrating a contrail. After uploading her pictures she also noticed the glowing orb or UFO. It's too difficult to jump to the conclusion that it's reflected light or that it's an actual object. She said it happened in an instant. You be the judge."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.349201,+-89.083783(37580)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37580) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in La Salle","There were no other sightings in La Salle on or around October 25th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"My mother was taking pictures of CHEMtrails and a CONtrail when she noticed something...","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
