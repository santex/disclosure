As i was standing there smoking i heard the animals in the area seemed very excited barking etc.very eerie outside. So i walked to the front of the drive way and stood there for a minute then i looked toward the field across from my house which it has a large grassy area.Then i saw a bright flash of light orb or round orb that morphed .As soon as i could really get a good look focus it pulsed out to darkness but when this happened my eyes caught a stream of light that moved so fast that it left a stream trail (not clouds)plasma or something. This was not a meteorite or shooting star or satellite.Also there was another event with more witnesses from another time that was similiar but not the same."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.946054,+-86.671425(42509)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42509) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"dogs ,animals ect. brite light orb","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42509.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42509.html"],"Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/11/2012 08:45 UTC","Longitude":"-86.671425"}
