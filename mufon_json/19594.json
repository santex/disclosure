I noticed bright lights in the sky and was curious to what it was so I pulled into the nearby Friendly's parking lot. We watched it hover right above our heads about 40 feet in the sky. The object was a small, black, triangular shaped and made no sound. It seemed to pick up gradual speed as it moved in the distance. I was so shocked that I didn't snap a picture till it got farther away. But I do have a picture of the object. Apparently several other sightings have been made in the same area and a show called \"UFOs in Bucks County\" was featured on the History Channel. This just really put things in perspective. I callled the 9-11 and they sent a cop who literally drove by us and acted like he didn't see us I guess to avoid doing a police report."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19594.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19594_submitter_file1__IMG_0047.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19594.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/22/2009 10:15 UTC","Latitude":"40.182124"}
