{"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Colorado","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had started my car to let it warm up and upon exiting my vehicle, looked up and saw a single, steady, point of light approximately 65` above and about 10` West of due North, traveling in a linear motion towards the ENE at a high rate of speed. It was featureless and soundless, I ruled out the possibility of it being a commercial or civilian aircraft because of it's velocity and the absence any navigation or anti-collision lights. I cannot give an accurate estimate of it's speed or altitude, but as a frequent observer of ISS, Space Shuttle and other satellite flyovers it was easily apparent that the object was covering the sky 2.5 to 3 times faster than any orbiting vehicle I have seen before. The object easily traveled 30` in about 10 to 12 seconds.It slowly faded from view about 45` above the NE horizon."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-105.078804","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Log Number":"US-03202010-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/20/2010 06:38 UTC","Summary":"Single point of solid light moving at high velocity.","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Arvada","There were no other sightings in Arvada on or around March 20th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Arvada","Latitude":"39.807004","Case Number":"22405","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22405.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.807004,+-105.078804(22405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22405) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/20/2010 05:54 UTC"}
