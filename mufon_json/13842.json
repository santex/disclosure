{"Longitude":"-98.817562","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving into eastland from ranch rd 570. i was just outside eastland, approaching i-20 when i rounded a bend and noticed a large flash of orange light to the se over the leon river area south of i-20. i caught the flash out of the corner of my eye, and it was gone in a second. i began to wonder if i had really seen anything. i passed under i-20 and continued into eastland on east main st. about a half-mile into town after passing i-20, i noticed a small but bright row of three lights appear out of nowhere in the same area of sky--se off towards i-20 and the leon river. the lights were close together and were white with an orange tinge. at first i thought it was just a plane with its landing lights on (eastland has a small airport, and you see stuff like this all the time. what caught my attention was the orange tint. i had actually seen these same lights earlier this year january 15th on the same stretch of road. on the jan. 15th sighting, the lights hovered atop a large cloud over eastland as i was driving into town on the same road. suddenly the lights disappeared. a minute or two later i saw them again in my side mirror. they were behind me at the opposite end of the sky in the south. the object did not travel from point a to point b. it just disappeared and reappeared. i did not report this sighting before. i thought the hovering and disappearing and reappearing was strange, but i convinced myself that it must've been two separate planes with their landing lights on. however, i change my tune now because i saw the same lights again tonight (nov. 19) and what they did next made me realize that they were anything but plane lights.) back to the nov. 19th sighting: after i saw the set of three orange tinted lights appear, they immediately appeared to merge into one large globe of orange light! the globe was about the diameter of the original three lights. at this point, the light was all orange, no white light. immediately after the lights merged into one, it appeared that two more globes of orange light of the same size emerged from the one forming a string of three lights in a horizontal line. a short pause passed and then a fourth orange globe appeared in the line. this set of lights were of a different size, color, and were more widely spaced apart than the original orange\\white object it had morphed from. almost as soon as the string of lights appeared they blinked out all at once. immediately, one of the orange globes of light flashed on and off in a different location at a higher altitude and to the left of the original object. immediately after that, another one of the orange globes of light flashed on and off above and just to the right of the last one. and that was it. it all happened really fast within a matter of seconds. i was driving as it was happening and didn't have time to grab my phone to take a picture or anything. i almost had a wreck looking at it. i was completely awed and fascinated. i have never seen lights as big as those in the sky and the whole display took up a huge area in the sky, and it was really their behavior that surprised me. these were not street lights or plane lights. i actually saw the white strobes of two planes flying in the same section of sky as the ufo, traveling in opposite directions and these globes of light dwarfed those or any other plane lights i have ever seen. the lights appeared and disappeared as quickly as you please. they did not appear to be lights attached to one large craft; i could see no indication of the body of a craft. they looked like \"disembodied\" lights doing really strange things. after the sighting, i decided to travel in the direction of the object and got onto hwy 6 traveling toward carbon and gorman. just outside of carbon i saw a cluster of white strobes blinking alternately in a repeating pattern. the group of lights moved steadily and in formation to the east. they moved pretty quickly and lost sight of them after a while. i had never seen a cluster of strobes in such tight formation; however, i must concede that this part of the sighting could have a group of planes flying in formation. the lights looked like your run-of-the-mill plane lights. it's just unusual to see planes flying in tight formation in this area, and i've lived in eastland co. all my life. but i do have to concede that this last group of lights could be explained as normal aircraft in formation. however, the orange lights i saw were completely unexplainable to me."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering,Other","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Eastland","There were no other sightings in Eastland on or around November 19th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"11/19/2008 07:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"32.40152","Log Number":"US-11202008-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/19/2008 07:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.40152,+-98.817562(13842)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13842) map </A>","Case Number":"13842","Summary":"Orange string of lights hovering, disappearing, and reappearing in different locations","City":"Eastland","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13842.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13842.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
