Where it was in the sky was very clear and blue. At first it appeared to be a solid and strangely shaped square, like a solid, white hole in the sky, but as I kept driving I noticed it was more of a diamond-shape and also appeared to have a vertical line going through the center of the shape. The shape was very solid and defined. I kept watching it to see if it was perhaps a plane flying but it remained stationary in the sky. After watching it for a little over one minute, it disappeared, almost dissolving into itself. Then after a few seconds it reappeared in a materializing way and was the exactly same size and shape as before it disappeared. I kept watching it but I didn't see it disappear again trees began to block my view."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.883627,+-85.605356(51001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51001) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51001.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.883627"}
