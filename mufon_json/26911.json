I estimate five miles west of the fowlerville exit. I saw three lights that seemed somewhere between a star and a plane light in brightness. They were making a pretty large triangle, so they must have been decently far apart. I saw them driving and continued watching them, they didn't appear to move in any fashion. Their height was just above the treeline. They then vanished. This was the second time my girlfriend and I had witnessed this event, on the same stretch of freeway. Same amount of lights and to my memory, same distances apart and locations (approximately). They were to the south of me so my estimate was about 5 miles southwest of the fowlerville fairgrounds (that was the nearest exit on I-96."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"42.660589","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"26911","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/20/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26911.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26911.html"],"Summary":"three lights in sky hover and vanish. near fowlerville fairgrounds, I-96","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Fowlerville","There were no other sightings in Fowlerville on or around November 20th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-12092010-0007","Date Submitted":"12/09/2010 02:38 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Fowlerville"}
