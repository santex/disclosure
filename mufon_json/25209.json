I looked out to see if it was a cloudy night and I saw that the stars were out. The first star i noticed was a bright one ,the size of Venus. I assumed that it was a planet until i saw that it was moving. I yelled at my friends that it was a U.F.O , but they went inside anyway. I stood watching , looking for a flashing light or some sound and i got neither. I watched it go from the southern part of the sky heading north.An airplane passed over it, and i wondered if they might collide.The object was clearly below the plane ,the plane was not at cruising altitude. we have a lot of air traffic around here. I yelled for my other friend to come outside , i asked her what she thought it was as it was moving away from us. She said the same things i thought (no blinking light, no sound). We watched as it disappeared in to the clouds. People were walking by , and no one stopped."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-08282010-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.897112,+-77.029226(25209)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25209) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"38.897112","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"08/27/2010 08:54 UTC","Case Number":"25209","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25209.html"],"City":"Washington","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Size of Venus"}
