WE WERE LAYING ON THE GROUND ON OUR BACKS WITH OUT SHOT GUNS OVER OUR CHESTS. ALL OF A SUDDEN I LOOKED UP AND YELLED TO THE OTHER GUYS THAT THEY SHOULD LOOK UP AND WE WERE LOOKING AT THE 3 DISCS MOVING VERY SLOW. ONE OF THE GUYS SHOT AT IT WITH HIS SHOT GUN. AFTER THAT WE DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING BUT FOR THE LOST TIME WE WOKE UP AND OUR SHOT GUNS WERE OFF TO OUR SIDES AND WE DONT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. THE DISCS TOOK OFF NORTH AT A HIGH SPEED AFTER THAT. THERE WERE 5 OF US AND WE ALL GOT SOME KIND OF CANCER. MY FOUR OTHER FRIENDS DIED FROM CANCER EARLY ON, AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO SURVIVE. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION. I CANT TELL YOU IF WE WERE TAKEN INTO ONE OF THOSE SHIPS OR NOT. I DONT RECALL. ITS LIKE LOST TIME, AND CANT ACCOUNT FOR IT.
