{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile driving south on 127 between I-70 and Eaton, Ohio, I noticed an intensely bright object in the sky to the east. The time was 5:12 AM, with sky conditions being very cloudy with no stars or the moon visible. The object showed no running lights or anything that would make it appear to be a conventional aircraft. Object appeared to be stationary from my moving position. Once I arrived at work, the object was still visible and stationary from the parting lot. Total observation time was about 5 minutes. I lost sight of the object when I had to go inside."],"Date of the Event":"01/02/2011 05:12 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/02/2011 08:52 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Eaton","There were no other sightings in Eaton on or around January 2nd 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.74394,+-84.63662(27214)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27214) map </A>","Case Number":"27214","Latitude":"39.74394","Longitude":"-84.63662","Log Number":"US-01022011-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27214.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27214.html"],"City":"Eaton","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Bright stationary light on cloudy night.
