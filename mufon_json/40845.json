I was nearby watching her do this. After a while she show me the pic and wanted me to see that an object was near the top of the pic. The tree in the background is dead and has no leaves on it. There was no plane flying by. It doesn't look like a bird either. So apparently it was not visible to our eyes but her digiatl camera was able to capture it flying by. She was facing south by southeast."],"Log Number":"US-07152012-0034","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
