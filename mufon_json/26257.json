She and I were taking pictures at the same time but she caught this disc in one of her pictures. We didn't realize what was there until we started to review on the camera the pictures she took. I imediately down loaded them to the computer. We were totally surprised to see this disc. You can see the sunshine hitting the top and the shadows on the bottom so we knew it was something solid.
