Looked up and saw a silver disc shaped ufo partly going into what appeared to be a hole in the sky. It moved very slowly and was being swallowed into the hole. It was like the sky opened up because the stars were not in there place. They were warped somewhat and as it finally went through, which took a few seconds, the sky closed behind it and they stars went back to thier original position. Never seen a ufo do this before."],"City":"Phoenix","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-112.067967","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome","Log Number":"US-09302009-0014","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around September 24th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.453107,+-112.067967(19752)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19752) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/24/2009 02:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Date Submitted":"09/30/2009 05:51 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.453107","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
