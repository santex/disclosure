Curious as to what it was, was aluminum skintype, a round sphere on either end, with a narrow round body between. Looked tohave a gondala underneath on which a light pulsed either red or green my brotherand myself argued over what colour it was. No markings but windows were evidentcould not see inside because of lighting. The object coasted slowly over thefield going to the north, then it did a smooth turn back to the south object didnot bank like an airoplane, more like a car turning around. It coasted back tomy original point of referance and then shot off at an extremly fast speed. Nosound was heard may have to do with the fact we were inside the house, about a14 mile away. Weather was bright and sunny no clouds evident. Drew a picture ofthe object for my parants and for my classmates."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"","Summary":"Barbell shape, sharp and clear sighting","Region":"Saskatchewan","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-107.517219","City":"Spiritwood","Object Features":"Window(s), Other","Case Number":"2856","Date of the Event":"04/30/1983 10:00 UTC","Latitude":"53.366499","Date Submitted":"04/30/1983 10:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Spiritwood","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.366499,+-107.517219(2856)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2856) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2856.html"]}
