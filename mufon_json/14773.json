{"divs":["sighting detailsi was with a group of about four friends. my friend mark, his wife, myself and my wife. we were seated, inside a gazebo, looking out over the water right on the beach and it was night time. we were looking at the moon way out over the water because it was very bright that night and the sky was clear, except for a couple clouds to either side. it created quite a neat effect. we had looked up at the moon several times admiring its beauty. my other friends got to talking and when i looked up again i noticed a bright reddish-orange orb to the right of the moon. it was round, very bright, no distinctive markings or movement. being the moon was about full from what i remember, this object seemed to be about one tenth of its size or less from my viewpoint. this object was way out over the water with no other lights, boats, city lights or anything nearby. then, to my surprise, a second or two later the reddish-orange orb appeared way to the left of the moon. it did not travel there, it just disappeared from the one spot and reappeared in the new spot. at this point my friend mark, whom i did not realize had seen this too, asked me, \"did you see that!\" we then watched together the orb appear once more to the lower right of the moon. after that it did not return. the distance\\speed would have been incredible for the time involved. we looked for another hour but it never came back. our wives, talking a lot like they do, did not see this event and it happened so quickly. we did not notice any similar lights, boats, or anything else in the area again. there was an airplane that did pass by in the distance with its typical flashing lights shortly thereafter and moved just like you'd expect an airplane would. but not like the orb we saw. my friend later told me he had seen the orb at least one or two more times more right before i had. i had seen the orb three times, he at least four of five. i tried over the months to rationalize the event. the more i thought about it the more it bothered me. i have been to countless air shows and know what aircraft we have and what they can do, fire works shows, and know what powerful laser pointer lights can do too. this event was none of the above. i just can't explain it. there were no sounds and nothing can move at that speed. i finally felt compelled to tell someone just to get this off my chest. i know what i saw and i just cannot discount that. when this happened i was fascinated and very curious. i was not scared nor do i remember any other emotions. there must have been hundreds of people at that time that could have seen this as the beaches are located all along the coast with countless hotels that overlook the water. ideas????"],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2008 09:35 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.69669","Date of the Event":"07/17/2008 09:35 UTC","Log Number":"US-01052009-0015","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Myrtle Beach","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"14773","Summary":"Reddish Orange Orbs appeared and disappeared","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14773.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14773.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"South Carolina","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.69669,+-78.881904(14773)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14773) map </A>","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There was one other sighting in Myrtle Beach on or around July 17th 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-78.881904","Object Shape":"Circle"}
