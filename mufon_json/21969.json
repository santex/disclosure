So i went into my back yard with two lady friends of mine and we witness by then a building floating over the city in Clovis , California . I told Billy i talk to him later and so i hung up the phone . I was in total awe to the size and the aray of lights going around this thing . It look like a building with deep red lights going around it in the clock wise posion . Well i watched it for about 5 minutes traveling south bound out of Clovis to Kings county . This has been the closes i've been to a UFO in all my life and me and the ladies still talk about it to this day . I think it is government myself , but i could be wrong . Well that is all i have right now to share . I've seen alot more UFO's too before that over Clovis area . The people i've been talking too have been seeing alot in the night skies and coming down to the mountains in the Clovis area . There are alot of strange things going on in the night skies in the central valley . I even witness a metalic cigar shape thing above Clovis back in Feb. 2008 . I was standing in the front yard with a friend and in the day light looing up and the south vally out of Clovis Calif. I seen jets coming up from the south , but this one did'nt have fins or wings on it and boy was it long . I told my friend about it and he said to me yeah it's a plan and then i told him look again and see it you can see any fins or wings on it . Well he looked again and he was in shock to see a cigar shape plane or what ever you want to call it and we talked just a couple of seconds and then it was traveling east bound without banking in the sky . It did a 90 degree trun without banking in the sky and we both were in awe then . Everytime we see each other now we talk about what we've seen in the day time skies over Clovis Calif. Thank you for your time and i hope this can help you our alittle bit . May Yahweh bless Mufon and all that it does ......... YHWH ......"],"Date Submitted":"02/21/2010 10:44 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-119.701659","Region":"California","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21969.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21969.html"],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Clovis","There were no other sightings in Clovis on or around April 30th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.830888,+-119.701659(21969)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21969) map </A>","Summary":"A building flying over my city","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02212010-0015"}
