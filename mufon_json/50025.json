These lights are coming around fairly often at least 2-3 times a week and that is just what i notice maybe everyday i will have to pay closer attention. Some orbs appear to pulse to different color briefly when they are close but hold a bright star like color when in the distance this i why i have noticed it, i thought it was the north star or something but compass on my phone said SE and stars don't fly around. Definitely not a plane i see planes at all times of the day around here and this thing is in no way shape or form a plane."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08202013-0009","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"North Carolina","Summary":"orange orb definately not plane there are a lot of planes flying over the area all the time i know what they should look like and this was not a plane."}
