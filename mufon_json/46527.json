This is something I do when they are spraying close to our home. When I put the pics on my pc, I saw something that looked like a helicopter in one of the pics. Since i did not remember hearing a chopper while takin the photo, i decided to zoom in. As i did, i discovered that the \"chopper\" was actually a black colored bird, wings tucked in flight. What I had not seen until the pic was blown up, were 4 small, circular to oblong shaped, grey colored objects that appear to be flying in formation. Two of them show light reflection, giving them a doom shaped appearance. I don't know what they were...but birds they are not. If you zoom in on the attatched photo, you will see two birds in flight. Behind the one that has the silhouette similar to a helicopter, you can see the 4 objects in the distance. they are in the upper right side of the photo."],"Case Number":"46527","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.23921,+-90.967101(46527)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46527) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Eolia"}
