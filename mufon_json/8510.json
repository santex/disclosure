[I did not notice this at the time I was taking the picture.] The cloud itself was strange, as it was thick and dark, and extended for quite a distance across the sky. If you look inside the cloud, near the entry point, there seem to be two or three discernable dots, which might be lights inside the cloud. This is why I checked the \"triangle\" box above, as it is possible that there is a triangular object inside the dark cloud (just a hunch!). I don't believe that the white orbs are due to dust or light reflection, as the \"trail\" seems to be entering or leaving the dark cloud at exactly the right point (based on the darkness and thickness of the cloud)."],"Case Number":"8510"}
