It was northwest of me moving southeast towards Morgan Hill and Southern New Jersey. As we watched this light seemed to pause for about 30 seconds, not moving at all. Then it started movin again, continuing on it's SE path. As it moved it started to flicker, fade, and become smaller before finally disappearing somewhere around the Delaware River. If I had to pick a town it disappeared over, it would be Reiglesville, PA."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29817.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29817.html"]}
