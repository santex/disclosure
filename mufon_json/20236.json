We have had an increase in the last year of other sighting and i did some reseach and found that the area i live in has a history of UFO sightings. the triangle shaped UFo for instance that you have on your main page was spoted this summer by a group of 10 or more witnesses. It was only a hundred or so feet off the ground and made no sound as it few over the groups heads. the pic i am sending is intresting because it was taken before home computers and would have been hard to fake"],"Date of the Event":"06/24/1962 12:27 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"20236","Log Number":"US-11012009-0006","Date Submitted":"11/01/2009 12:19 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
