I wish to express my viewpoint on Jacques Vallee's conslusion that the UFO's are part of the phenomenon Known as the 'Secret Commonwealth' of beings that can become pure energy, defeat space time and do a number of other things. At first I agreed with him but now I do not. the UFO's are crafts like our jets and shuttlecraft. they have bodies likke us. these other 'anomolous' beings do not. you might note that in most abductions a landing takes place where in the 'secret commonwealth' people can just vanish like air. We must draw that clear line between these two worlds."],"Log Number":"US-01072013-0008","Region":"Illinois","Case Number":"45075","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"01/07/2013 03:12 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"comments on Vallee","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around August 15th 2009"],"City":"Chicago","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.880674,+-87.624008(45075)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45075) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45075.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45075.html"]}
