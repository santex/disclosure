I always stop and search the sky for anomalies. This is the first time I saw something I couldn't explain. In the western sky I saw what appeared to be a strange configuration of four stars. All the same size and brightness. I noticed this because I had never seen this configuration before, it was so unusual. I watched intently to see if there was any movement and I noticed that the two stars in the center were moving slowly down and away, perhaps more westerly. I was careful to watch for a few minutes and noticed that they were definitely moving away from the other two \"stars\" They were way too high to be planes and then, as I was watching, they just \"blinked\" out! They weren't shooting stars, there wasn't any truly fast movement and they didn't fade, they just disappeared."],"Region":"New Jersey","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Latitude":"40.578492","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Woodbridge Township","There were no other sightings in Woodbridge Township on or around February 4th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/04/2011 06:02 UTC","Log Number":"US-02042011-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27644.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27644.html"],"Summary":"Two moving lights in sky","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
