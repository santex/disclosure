I thought it wasa jet and ignored it. When I got into my firends car, we began to pull out ofthe parking lot, I looked up and saw what appeared to be the same three lightsover the same path it had originally been over - but it was at a lower altitudeand flying in the opposite direction. As it came past our car I got a closerlook at the object. It appeared triangular and was a bit offset. Then, as itpassed by, it appeared to turn on its side and fly between two nearby buildings. As the car turned on Forest I tried to see if the object had come out on theother side - there was no sign of it."],"Case Number":"2127","Weather Factors":"Windy","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/07/2003 07:14 UTC"}
