At 10:25pm, I noticed a diamond shaped object in the sky, below the cloud cover. It was shaped so that the lower half was smaller than the top half, and it had various white and red lights on it. It immediately appeared strange and unfamiliar to me. I turned my radio off and opened my car door, but could hear no noise at all coming from the object. It passed over the houses heading east, stopped, hovered for a moment and then banked toward the north, continuing in that direction. I lost sight of it as I turned into my driveway and it continued north. I found the whole event to be strange, since we were in a severe thunderstorm area. At the time, there was no rain falling, and the winds were calmer than previously. There was lightening, periodically, which made the object even more visible."],"trends":["There have been 78 other sightings in Oklahoma City","There were no other sightings in Oklahoma City on or around June 27th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Oklahoma City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"35.327068"}
