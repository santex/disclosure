{"Latitude":"46.731453","Case Number":"30313","divs":["Sighting DetailsWell I was waiting for my wife at a Target store in Brooklyn Park, Mn. When I noticed 3 lights coming from the East going West, they were red orange balls. At first I thought they mite be helicopters, but color did not fit. As the came closer they were round and the moved slowly in the night sky. Time was about 10 pm they did not make any noise and stayed on a straight line and spaced pretty even, I could not tell how far apart the were maybe a half a block or so. There was about 10 or 12 people watching it happen, I do not know any of them. When I realized they where not planes I remove my camera from the bag and started taking pictures.. Using a Canon camera with a 300 mm lens."],"City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/01/2011 10:04 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":[""],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Minnesota","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.731453,+-94.68424(30313)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30313) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/23/2011 06:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-07232011-0007","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-94.68424","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30313.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30313_submitter_file1__IMG_3901.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30313_submitter_file2__IMG_390110x8croped.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30313_submitter_file3__IMG_391010x8croped.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30313.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:04","Summary":"3 Red/Orange fire ball in sky"}
