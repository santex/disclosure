Took out my video camera and saw that it was not a star but was a pulsating object that flared up and down. A few times it looked like it would disappear but would then flare up and produce a red halo effect. At one point a flashing light flew away from it to the left at high speed. The following day I filmed an orb of light flying through the air A few days later I filmed two strange looking objects at night. One with three lights and one with two. They were definitely not airplanes or helicopters. I have video footage of all five objects and can be seen on youtube under alfie008."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/10/2008 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.772781,+-78.801887(14170)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14170) map </A>"}
