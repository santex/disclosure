I saw some lights to the nnw that seemed a little high for house lights on the horizon so I just began watching them. Rolled down my window to assure they weren't reflections. They rose higher and higher. They never got any bigger, just remained about the size and color of house lights on the horizon. There were 5 or 6, flashing a little and in a straight line. Definitely not horizon lights. They eventially went directly over me. I did not pull over and didn't have a moonroof or anything so couldn't see them over head. I stuck my head out the window once, just to see. They were there and getting dimmer. I really thought I was going to be abducted or come up with missing time or something. I did not pull over. Was too frightened. Was sure that I would hear something about the lights on the news or something but never did."],"Log Number":"US-04122007-0003","Summary":"5-6 lights in sky, in a straight row, blinking and moved toward and over my car then disappeared.","Tags":"City","Case Number":"6800","Latitude":"43.966111","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","City":"St Anthony","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6800.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6800.html"]}
