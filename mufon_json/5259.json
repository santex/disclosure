I was looking up at the stars and I saw 2 Triagular Shaped Objects that had bright tinted Blue lights at the tips. They were going in a straight slow direction and then they flew up slowly towards the sky and disappeared. And my Mom saw the tip of one of the Flying Objects too. I was really shocked and scared at the same time. I told my Mom that there was something in the sky. I believe I experience a sighting of a UFO."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08162006-0006","Case Number":"5259","City":"Irvine","Latitude":"33.691247","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.691247,+-117.788224(5259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5259) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/15/2006 11:09 UTC","Summary":"I saw a Triagular UFO coming home through Santiago Canyon with my Mom","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Irvine","There were no other sightings in Irvine on or around August 15th 2006"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5259.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5259.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
