Almost ever night glowing space craft (disks) are seen swooping in low to the ground and moving up then back down and taking off at a high rate of speed to the north. These are not Planes these are extraterrestrial craft. There is no way to save the video but I have been recording them with my video camera aimed at my computer monitor and this works quite well. The Weather Cam runs full streaming so it���s live. Amazing what we are seeing coming in from space. MM from MUFON has a great still shot of what I am saying taken in November of this year. Her website is www.skyscan.org This goes with the reports of disks from the previous Florida reports and I can CFM that disks have been in this area of Jupiter and Port St Lucie. Folks get out your video and digital cameras tonight at 10:00PM a full lunar eclipse is happening and I'm sure many UFO���s will be around as well. Also The Space Shuttle landed Today that what the double Sonic Boom was."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02202008-0007","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Jupiter","There were no other sightings in Jupiter on or around February 20th 2008"],"Latitude":"26.941895","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9651.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9651.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Florida"}
