I went with my friend to Castleton Indiana (a surburb in northern Indianapolis), and followed behind the storm. We were seeing some very neat lighting and decided to pull into a parking lot near the Castleton Square Mall to view the lighting and allow the storm to pass a little more. Suddenly we saw lights emerge from the clouds and saw three triangular shaped ships pass overhead very quickly. I got out of the car to look in the direction that the craft had taken, but they had disappeared. I noticed a light pattern on the underside of the craft that matched the triangular shape of the craft. I would have reported this incident much sooner, however I did not know where to report it."]}
