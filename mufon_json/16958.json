I thought probably a plane but took the photo anyway. Later on while looking at it I realized it's a perfect boomerang shape. Could be a conventional craft, who knows. The object was moving slowly and since I thought nothing about it I didn't pay anymore attention to it. Now I regret not using a zoom to get a closer picture. Pay not attention to the time stamp. My new Nikon S630 is the greated camera I have ever owned but the time stamp is different that the actual camera settings. I need to contact Nikon for warranty."]}
