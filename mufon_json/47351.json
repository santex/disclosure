We sitting by the camp fire when a Native who was fishing down by the river approximately 100-200 yards away came yelling saying to look up at the sky. I looked up over the field and saw 4 lights by then 2 of them had disappeared since the native had yelled to look at the lights. I quickly turned around and started calling over more people, in total maybe 8 people saw it from my point of view. This is a second time these lights were viewed over this area, but last time only one person saw it. I knew right away it was a ufo because the only airport around was 20km away and only have Cessna planes in there fleet and occasionally a Canadian coast guard helicopter which is bright orange flies over and an air rescue from the hospital. But there has never been more then 3 aircraft in the air at that altitude. The objects just disappeared 1 by one and soon they were all gone."],"Region":"Ontario","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"was 6 lights at first and in a few second 4 then 2 and then none","City":"South Bruce Peninsula","Case Number":"47351","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.507929,+-81.325347(47351)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47351) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/11/2013 11:48 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47351.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47351.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-05112013-0011","Country":"Canada"}
