It was very bright, like Jupiter has been the past few months, and did not pulse, blink, or flash, which was why it grabbed my attention. I thought it might be another plane and I wasn't seeing the flashing lights because of the angle it was approaching so I continued to watch it as it came towards me. It flew over me, was silent, in a straight path and slowly got dimmer and turned green, then disappeared directly over me. I could not tell how high it was, the other planes did not seem to notice it, or if they did they did not change their flight paths. It makes me think that perhaps this object was much lower in altitude than they were but that would just be a guess. It did not make me feel differently other than just curious."],"Region":"South Carolina","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.031476,+-81.072473(34041)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34041) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"12/15/2011 07:10 UTC","Longitude":"-81.072473","Country":"United States"}
