It came immediately into my view and was very close, about twice as high as a tall palm tree. The shape was elonagated and there were colors swirling around the front in the direction it was traveling, which was south. Then suddenly it disappeared and and I was left with a quiet twilight evening, a couple of stars just beginning to come out. I had no feelings or reactions because it wasn't there long enough for me to react. I was just very disappointed afterwards that it didn't stay longer and that no-one was with me to share the experience."],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-110.924239","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","City":"Tucson","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9668.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9668.html"],"trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around September 20th 2005"],"Summary":"Elongated shape, very close....not very high, colors swirling around the front, completely silent.","Date Submitted":"09/20/2005 06:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-02212008-0011","Case Number":"9668","Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.231503,+-110.924239(9668)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9668) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/20/2005 06:20 UTC"}
