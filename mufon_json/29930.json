I was on my back deck facing the nw sky it came out of nowhere, it moved from west to east and backed up slowly, this object seemed slowly came back toward the east (of course i live near lake erie only 60 miles) it seem to huvver over the lake and slowly rose into the sky.. The bright orange light went out and it reappeared bout 1 minute later only lower to the ground and it proceeded to go se of me. It was not a jet cuz 2 minutes later the Air Force jets were flying over!!! I freaked out and tried to take pics on my phone they never came thru."],"Latitude":"41.04422","Summary":"afireball that moved side toside and rose into the sky","Date Submitted":"07/04/2011 03:39 UTC","Longitude":"-83.649932","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29930.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29930.html"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Findlay","There were no other sightings in Findlay on or around July 3rd 2011"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
