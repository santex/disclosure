Being around 10:30pm, I expected to see a series of blinking lights as normal. Instead I saw what appeared to be a slow moving fireball, approximately 4 times larger than the usual sight of a plane flying at that local altitude. I watched it move from the east, and just as it was directly overhead the light it emitted vanished and I could no longer see the UFO. It was as if all of its light was coming from the front of what ever it was and as soon as it was passed my field of vision, it became invisible. Two things about this event left me with an eerie feeling. 1) The object was entirely silent 2) It appeared that multiple shooting star like objects ejected from it from multiple directions."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"47913","Summary":"Looked like a slow moving fireball with mild directional changes, multiple shooting stars came out in all directions","Date Submitted":"06/05/2013 11:07 UTC","City":"Naugatuck","Longitude":"-73.054835","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47913.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47913.html"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Naugatuck","There were no other sightings in Naugatuck on or around June 5th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.505836,+-73.054835(47913)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47913) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"41.505836"}
