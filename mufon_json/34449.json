Pulled over because they seemed fairly low and to see if I could hear what it was by the time I pulled over and got out I only saw one, and two to three seconds later saw the second one pull up from behind a hill and climb up past the first one. That object continued to climb until it faded from view (appx. 1 min. later) The first one maintained its original course and eventually climbed (not as steeply) until it was out of sight. They were visible for appx. 7 min. and I never heard any sounds from them (traffic on highway was fairly light). I called my wife to have her look from Clearlake Oaks and she said she observed them for appx 18 minutes. I'm retired military, have worked on aircraft for several years and I can't tell you what I was looking at!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
