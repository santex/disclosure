{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Santa Fe","divs":["Sighting DetailsSunset, while in a park in Santa Fe New Mexico, an extremely slivery bright light tear drop shape high in the sky to the west. Did not appear to be a weather baloon. Changed from bright silvery light to orange over about an hour. Later changed from tear dropped to round. A loooong distance away and high. One man watching with me said he had seen what he thought was the same object when he went to work 12 hours earlier at Los Alamos National Labs, New Mexico, before sunrise. Located at approximately the same position in the sky. High up and a long way away. Some clouds moved in but you could still see the bright round shape through the thin clouds. I went home and could no longer see the object due to buildings. Definately not the moon.Will look at the same location today....it is cloudy so probably not able to see."],"Date of the Event":"06/08/2009 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/08/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"New Mexico","Summary":"Extremely bright slow moving tear drop.","Latitude":"35.694845","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17394.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like, Teardrop","Case Number":"17394","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06092009-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.694845,+-105.936339(17394)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17394) map </A>","Longitude":"-105.936339","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Santa Fe","There were no other sightings in Santa Fe on or around June 8th 2009"],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
