The first object was observed for 15 minutes over Christchurch City. I was standing outside having a coffee and a cigarette when I noticed a light streak across the sky from south to north then suddenly stop and hover then begin to move at high speed erratically across the sky. The first object appeared as a very bright point of light that would dim as it moved at high speed and at its lowest point it looked disk like. I observed this object for over ten minutes as it made right angle turns and moved around at very high speeds. The second object appeared in much the same way as the first except from the east to west both began to move to follow each other at which point I lost sight of them as a bank of cloud rolled in and made observation impossible. This would put both objects at a very high altitude and by their movement and way of arrival I cannot see this as an aircraft. I did not notice any sound other than normal street traffic noise."],"Log Number":"NZ-10102009-0002","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"10/10/2009 09:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","Case Number":"19881","Latitude":"-43.530884","Country":"New Zealand","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19881.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Christchurch","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Tags":"City","Region":"Canterbury","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"172.645585","Date Submitted":"10/10/2009 04:44 UTC","Summary":"Fast moving disk like object"}
