All of the sudden I saw this pale green ball of light streak in front of my car. It was traveling extremely fast. I was afraid someone had shot a flare or firework at my car. I watched for the object to hit the ground and explode but I did not see any explosion. The object was gone. I couldn't believe my eyes. I had slowed to a stop, looked back across the road where it had come from. I saw no futher movement or lights. It really scared me because it was so close in front of my vehicle. It reminded me of small green shooting star traveling with the ground. I originally reported this in November 06 when it happened. The report must have been lost. I also remember that I looked at my clock on the dashboard and no time was lost."],"Log Number":"US-02042007-0003","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:12","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6316.html"],"City":"Jonesville","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.639788,+-84.775503(6316)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6316) map </A>","Region":"Kentucky","Longitude":"-84.775503","Summary":"Flouresent pale green light streaking in front of my car","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Jonesville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Teardrop","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"6316","Latitude":"38.639788","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown"}
