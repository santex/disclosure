It was too close to be a plane; it was not a bird. It kept bouncing from left to right and down then up and diagonal. It seemed to be changing shape as it would change speed from quick to slow. At one point it looked to be long and going vertical, then a bright light came from it, like it lite up but white-not like from the sun, but an illuminous light that came from the object itself. It was small and at times kept fading somewhat but not completely. The duration of the event was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. I almost wrecked the whole time."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-83.845563","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Flushing","There were no other sightings in Flushing on or around May 14th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Oval, Star-like, Other","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/14/2009 05:05 UTC","Latitude":"43.064793","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"16928"}
