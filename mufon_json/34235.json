{"Country":"United States","City":"San Francisco","Case Number":"34235","divs":["sighting detailsi was just out getting my mail last night (tues 12\\20\\11)at 7:15pm and saw this weird orange thing flying up in the sky - it was strange because the light was larger than a plane, and it flickered like a flame. i was moving across the sky, make a slight curve and then it stopped - which really got me interested, because planes don't do that! it stayed stationary in the sky for a few seconds and then it slowly started to dim, until it finally disappeared completely. i stood waiting for a while to see if it would reappear but it didn't - it was just the dark night sky with no trace of it. btw - it was a completely clear night (no clouds at all) and stars were visible. i had never seen this kind of movement in the sky and thought it must be an alien spacecraft. i was not afraid or anything, and even tried to talk to it when it had stopped - asking - can you see me?"],"Region":"California","Latitude":"37.77901","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34235.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34235.html"],"trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were no other sightings in San Francisco on or around December 20th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.77901,+-122.414186(34235)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34235) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Diamond, Teardrop","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/20/2011 07:15 UTC","Summary":"Large orange light moving across night sky, curved slightly and then came to a stop and hovered, then slowly dimmed and disappeared.","Log Number":"US-12212011-0003","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"12/21/2011 12:37 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.414186","Object Features":"Unknown"}
