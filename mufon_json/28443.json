I noticed an object a black orb some what oval shaped heading east bound about the same altitude as the police helicopters fly in the area. The object then banked left at a slow rate of speed. I could see see the sunlight reflecting off of the top and it gave off sheen that looked silver as it moved passed the sun's rays. Then the object headed North along Voss towards I-10. I tried to follow the object down Voss, but it was moving too fast. Traffic crawled to a stand still just passed Woodway so I watched it until it was out of site. I would say it moved at about twice the rate of a helicopter. It traveled in a straight line due North. It didn't bob or weave. It's path was straight, and it seemed to move with a purpose. The whole event was over by about 4:05PM. There were no noticeable sounds but there was a lot of traffic. No engine noise that would be associated with a plane or helicopter. I was in my car and I have no pictures."],"Latitude":"29.766713","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"03/28/2011 10:52 UTC","Summary":"Houston","Longitude":"-95.36094","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.766713,+-95.36094(28443)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28443) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03282011-0014"}
