{"Date Submitted":"01/21/2013 03:31 UTC","Case Number":"45343","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was playing with my daughter at the playground in Golden Gardens Park in Seattle just after sunset on a clear night when I observed an orange light traveling in a straight line from the North to the South very slowly. I have lived in the area for almost 20 years and am very familiar with the plane and helicopter flights patters and behavior. This one definitely jumped out in that there were no wing lights or flashing lights and due to the inconsistent flight pattern and much bright light than I have seen. The light appeared to waver or flicker as it traveled south. It then hovered briefly at the same latitude as the Golden Gardens bathhouse. I called attention to it to the two other dads at the playground and they also thought it was strange and didn't follow the usual flight patterns of plans, helicopters or anything like that. I ran to my car to grab my smartphone and came back and tried to take a video of the orb-like object, but instead took a photo (5:40pm). The light faded out very quickly just after I took the photo as if it was changing direction and heading west or up. Then I discussed further with the other two dads and they thought it definitely wasn't normal. I went to the bathroom on the west side of the bathhouse and came back out and there was another orange light of the same size following. One of the other dad's said he saw it and was coming to tell me. This time I took video (5:48pm) for about 40 seconds before the light faded out and disappeared again. I will try to upload both if I can get them off my phone."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"47.691772","Longitude":"-122.40393","Log Number":"US-01212013-0004","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Seattle","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around January 20th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.691772,+-122.40393(45343)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45343) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/20/2013 05:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45343.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45343.html"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Washington","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Two Orange Orbs Sighted West of Golden Gardens Park in Seattle Just After Sunset"}
