{"City":"Kitchener","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving down Traynor Ave in Kitchener when I spotted it in the sky directly in front of me. I pulled into the church parking lot to park and get out for a better view. There were 3 people there looking in the sky as well at the object. At first I thought it may have been a plane on fire or something because it looked kinda like fire but it was randomly pulsating and flashing and at times disappeared for a split second and reappeared in a different spot a little higher. There were no clouds in the sky, or airplanes that I could see. It was a beautiful evening 20 c. There was no noise... The object disappeared."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"Canada","Case Number":"32486","Date Submitted":"10/09/2011 04:51 UTC","Region":"Ontario","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-10092011-0015","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.444864","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Strange glowing fiery red light Multiple witnesses.
