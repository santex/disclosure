{"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Case Number":"50097","Region":"Pennsylvania","divs":["Sighting Details I was sitting on my front porch around 7:00 in the evening facing north on Taylor Ave. My peripheral vision caught a light coming from my right (east). I did not have my glasses on at the time and the light appeared to be shaped like a Christmas tree. I immediately put on my glasses and realized the Christmas tree shape was just a blur because I didn't have the glasses on. upon looking at the object with my glasses on I realized it was an orange star like object but larger than a star, especially for that time of night when it is still light out. It kept moving steadily east for a minute or two, not very fast, just sort of gliding. All of a sudden it stopped cold and started to pulsate. For a while it pulsated at a steady rate then the pulsating became less and less until it completely dissipated from its hovering position. This \"object\" did not fly away, ascend or descend. It just dissolved. No sound at any time during experience."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50097.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50097.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.409437,+-75.646661(50097)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50097) map </A>","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Scranton","There were no other sightings in Scranton on or around August 15th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"08/15/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.409437","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Scranton","Date Submitted":"08/23/2013 08:46 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08232013-0025","Summary":"noticed orange lite coming from east. stopped and hovered.pulsated for 30 seconds or so. pulsations became less intense . object dissipated.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-75.646661"}
