It's a quick flash and you'll need to watch the video frame by frame to see it. It appears to be a laser-like flash or the chopper's occupants were returning the favor by taking a photo of the person filming them. Better that scenario than them taking \"aim\" at him through a lighted scope!"],"Summary":"Ashland Kentucky Video of Helicopter","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37073.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37073.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04022012-0006","Region":"Kentucky","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Ashland","There was one other sighting in Ashland on or around March 30th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/02/2012 11:12 UTC"}
