I spotted what I thought at the time was a satellite, star like, moving in a straight line across the sky towards the East at a casual speed, when then It started to slow down, then I thought it might be a helicopter but then realized it cant be at there is no noise and they cant travel that high. It eventually came to a complete stop for about 2 seconds then started moving in the opposite direction. So we new it was not a plane, helicopter or satellite so we don't know what it could of been. Reason I did not report this sighting sooner is that I didn't get around to doing it ,saying to myself ''ill do it tomorrow'' then forgeting about it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Bangor","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.192347,+-4.130918(36388)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36388) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36388.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36388.html"],"Latitude":"53.192347","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Date of the Event":"07/10/2011 11:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/11/2012 09:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-4.130918","Case Number":"36388","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Bangor","There were no other sightings in Bangor on or around July 10th 2011"]}
