I first noticed it closing the curtains before bed, noticed a star where I don't think I've ever seen one before, then noticed its flicker, colors, and pluming. Especially notable because of the serious light pollution in downtown Chicago; only the very brightest stars are ever visible. Mostly I felt pleasure and wonder. My daughter confirmed its presence and appearance for me. Didn't so much lose sight of it as left it to write this report. It's still there, in fact, 10 mins later, has risen a few more degrees, moving up and easterly."],"Latitude":"41.882944","Case Number":"18614","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"08/12/2009 01:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08122009-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"Vigorously flickering star, noticeably moving, pluming light, changing colors"}
