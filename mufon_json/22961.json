{"divs":["sighting detailsi am going to work and it's 10:40pm. as i am entering the freeway, 101 south from grover beach, i immediately see a big red light futher away in the distance. it gets my attention right away. i don't take my eyes off of it, trying not to have an accident. the freeway is a bit busy as it normally is on a friday evening. i get closer to it, and bring down my window just to have a better view but also to see if there is any sounds...in case it's a helicopter or something. nothing. no sound. just one huge red light hovering really low right in between the freeway and walmart and trader joe's which is on the other side. it just sits there but i cannot see anything else. the sky is so black. i am straining to see more...i also noticed that no one else seem to pay attention to this object\\light at all which really surprised me. i wanted to pull over but felt it was very unsafe. i slow down as i am about to pass by it...i stick my head out the window a bit to have a better look...i see something sticking out in the back of the red light...a metallic shape..something. i can't even describe it. underneath the red light, i am seeing something roundish in shape, but can't even make that out either. it was as if it was invisible except for the red light! very strange. still no sound, no movement...no pulsing of light, nor blinking...it just sits there in the air, incredibly close to the ground....i'd say just a little bit higher than the street lights that are by the freeway. by now i have passed it, i look back at it, and see a white light, but nothing else. i can still see it in the side view mirror. a few hours later at work. i look at the clock in the kitchen and it says 5am. after that it's as if it went dark. i remember nothing. i remember feeling as if i am struggling or something, i can hear something, like sounds of struggle...then it's like i come to, and i am looking around, wondering where the hell i am, several seconds later i realize where i am, then i am really confused as to what happend as i am laying down on the floor in the hallway. my mind is a complete fog. but eventually passes and i feel fine. i am completely dumbfounded as to what happend. later on when i got home, about 2hrs later...i notice how sore my stomach is, the abdominal muscles. it gets more sore as the day progresses, including my ribs...they are tender, then the back of my arms. tricep area. the soreness lasted for 3 days."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grover Beach","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"35.121642","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/25/2010 02:36 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04252010-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Huge red light hovering 101 south in Grover Beach","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.121642,+-120.621282(22961)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22961) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22961.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22961.html"],"Case Number":"22961","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-120.621282","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Grover Beach","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/05/2010 10:40 UTC"}
