I was called early into work (security guard) I was driving to work and stopped at a light with a white truck next to me and a car next to him putting me in the left hand lane. I found myself looking up at a city sized triangular ship hovering above the stop lights. I couldnt take my eyes off it. There were three lights precisely placed at each corner. It moved very quickly where at a blink of an eye it moved further upward to the distance. I felt as if I needed to call the police but in 1995 cellphones were not readily available and accesable. I felt very scared and humbled, I have never felt this way, it terrified me. I didnt hear any music which my car radio was playing, I remember vividly,Panama by VanHalen was playing right before it appeared then there was no music."],"Log Number":"US-10212011-0017","Date of the Event":"04/25/1995 05:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/21/2011 09:05 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Glendale","There were no other sightings in Glendale on or around April 25th 1995"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"32768","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona"}
