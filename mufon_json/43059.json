When I first noticed what I thought was a bright star was moving in a stright line across the sky. The object was bright white light with no blinking lights with a random pulse of swirl from the rear??? Not even sure that is the best why to detail that. The object moved in a straight line going under the Moon, which I think was full. I lost site of it as it faded from view. As I watched it I wanted to believe it was a plane but with no sound, the speed and no lights, not sure what it was."],"Log Number":"US-10062012-0009","Summary":"{dr}Around the 6am very fast moving bright object moved across the sky from the NW going SE.
