The time was approximately noon and we were located on the left side of the pier. I took several photographs and did not notice anything in the sky or in the camera lens that seemed out of sorts. Approximately two hours later, we had moved to the north side of the pier (right side) and I again took several photographs. Again, nothing appeared out of the normal. Once home, I began the task of reviewing our photographs and noticed that on two (out of dozens) there appears to be a oval, round shaped black object hovering in the sky. It appears closer in one shot and farther out in the second. I cannot explain these objects. Some plausible explanations have been kite surfers, but no surfers appear in the shots and we did not notice any kite surfers at the time. There are reflections on the object that match the direction of the light. I took several shots in sequence at this area, and these are the only two that they appear in. Which, by my estimates, would somehow put the object in view for less than an eighth of a second."],"City":"Huntington Beach","Date of the Event":"07/07/2013 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"49323","Date Submitted":"07/30/2013 07:54 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-07302013-0018","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.661597,+-117.989766(49323)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49323) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
