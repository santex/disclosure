The color made me notice it immediately. There was No sound, first I thought it was a satellite, not an airplane or aircraft. Much too fast to be an aircraft or satellite, much too slow to be an asteroid. It faded away on the horizon but seemingly a few seconds too early, I felt I should have seen it longer in the distance. Was heading toward South Eastern in Iowa which possibly coincides with sighting in South Eastern Iowa on the same night. I have seen lots of satellites over the years while fishing in the dark and this object was bright orange unlike those yet about the same height in the sky to the naked eye. I was just shutting off my radio which was tuned to an earie segment of the Coast to Coast show by coincidence and so I felt a sense of specialness to the sight. I wanted to ask others if they saw it too but nobody was around in the darkness near me."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"06/29/2013 05:12 UTC"}
