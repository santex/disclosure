I went out from my home and could see some lights moving that are not starts since I have lived in my home and know what stars are supposed to be where and we also know what flies in the skies in our area, life copters and all of that. This was seen by my oldest son who is now a believer, he called me a bit excited about what he saw and he is 18 and knows when \"something\" is different and would not call me about UFO's for no reason or even as a joke. I must say I am jealous!!!"]}
