{"Latitude":"43.440506","Date of the Event":"02/05/2009 07:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"11:30:00","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsfor 4 years, my wife and i have lived near one of the highest spots on the top of a mountain in hot springs, sd which is in the black hills. four times over a period of the last 2 1\\2 weeks i have seen a long rectangular (ruler looking in shape) object with windows, the windows had white lights that appeared to go from dim to bright from the inside. there were also red lights that seemed to move through the windows at a less consistent rate. there were two dimmer lights in pale green on each end, with one large orange light randomly coming on in the middle of the object (not appearing to be a window) lasting for two to three seconds. i did not see this object every single night, but on the 5th and 6th of february, i did see it both evenings. it did not appear to be in the exact same location each night that i have seen it (i would estimate that it may have moved a mile to a mile and a half in location). when i saw the object on feb 5th, i called the fall river sheriff���s department at approximately 8:00 pm. shortly before 9:00pm he arrived on my land to look at the object in question. after looking at it, he was unsure of what it was and left to check it out. about 40 min later, i saw what appeared to be two helicopters flying over the area 3 times within 20 min. it seemed as if they approached the areal slowly and then turned around and flew away faster than they went in. about 15 min later, the sherriff called be back and said that he believed there was a construction site on the other side of the mountain and i was seeing lights from the equipment at that site. right after his call, i decided to go see this construction site for myself. i drove to the area beyond the mountain and there was nothing there! after that, i drove south to the hot springs airport, it was closed, but hovering 1-3 feet off the runway with the lights on was a helicopter inside of the fence of the airport. i tried to get their attention, but they would not come talk to me. i have never seen anything like this before and would normally consider myself to be a skeptic, but after seeing this four time in 2 ��� weeks, i am beginning to think something is really going on here. i tried to take pictures of this, but my camera is not the best and could not zoom in very far. if you contact me, i am willing to try to share the pictures i���ve taken but i am not normally a ���computer user��� so sending these things are very foreign to me! points you wanted clarified: #1 - i was outside taking my 6 months old puppy to potty. #2 - i noticed the lights in the distance that i had never seen before. #3 - at first i thought my neighbor on the mountain next o me might be building a new house. but after checking with him, he was also concerned as he is not building anything on his land. #4 - descriptions of the event is above. #5 ��� the first time i saw it, i wrote it off as nothing because i figured it was a house being built, but is did seem strange to me that if it was a new construction, how did they get so far, so fast? #6 - in the morning, when the light came up, i could not see it anymore."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02072009-0015","Case Number":"15375","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hot Springs","There were no other sightings in Hot Springs on or around February 5th 2009"],"Summary":"Ruler shaped, windows, white lights in windows with red lights moving through, bright orange light in the middle of object.","Date Submitted":"02/05/2009 07:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15375.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15375.html"],"Object Features":"Window(s)","Region":"South Dakota","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-103.465392","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.440506,+-103.465392(15375)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15375) map </A>","City":"Hot Springs","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
