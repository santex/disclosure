{"divs":["Sighting Details December 15th, 2007 No major sightings. No mysterious fog. Some minor ufo movement high in the sky above the lake at approx. 3am.(on the 16th) However... My daughter heard strange clicking noises outside which seemed to come from the trees on both sides of the road, so she got me and I went out and heard clicking noises as well. My daughter decided to snap some photos. We looked at the photos taken around the house next door which captured more orbs and one \"being\" peering out the window of the empty house. After taking several more photos to rule out a reflection or coincidental whatever. My husband yelled from the living room that the tv. picture was growing small and large. Wondering how to copyright before I go sending out photos. I have an alien photo, and my daughter wants it copyright before sending it or do you have advice on that. Also once this is sent, how do I make sure I get the photo to the right report?"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9566.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9566.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","City":"Granisle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-126.201368","Case Number":"9566","Date of the Event":"12/15/2007 06:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Granisle","There were 4 other sightings in Granisle on or around December 15th 2007"],"Latitude":"54.890275","Summary":"Dark figure, orbs & electrical disturbance","Region":"British Columbia","Log Number":"CA-02122008-0020","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.890275,+-126.201368(9566)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9566) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/15/2007 06:00 UTC"}
