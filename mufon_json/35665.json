That day I was driving and my husband was taking pictures of the scenery. I always make him take pictures and since we were by the coast I was making him take pictures of the ocean. We came home and forgot about the pictures for a few days. Then my husband wanted to see them so he could email some out and post some on FB. He uploaded them into my computer and we checked them out. Then we came across this picture that he had taken inside of the car and I noticed a spot. I asked him to zoom in and it looked round to me and as if it were flying in the opposite direction we were going in. The next picture was the same except, there was no spot. He didnt think anything of it but I did. I think it could be something. If I am wrong, then so be it. But I would be a fool to believe there isnt other life somewhere else."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02132012-0004","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"35665"}
