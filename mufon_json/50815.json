I immediately noticed a glowing mass coming into view over the roofline of my neighbor's house. I initially thought it may have been a fireworks burst, but instead of dissipating, it continued rise out of the southeast glowing orange-gold. At first sight, the object appeared to be about as large as an aspirin tablet held at arm's length. It limbed slowly, taking up a general southerly direction, and three times rained down orange-gold sparks, almost as if melting The object was very large and very bright. Suddenly, the thing grew dim, went dark, appeared to hover, then blinked off and on and off a couple of times before it disappeared from sight. I'm not sure what it was, but it clearly wasn't an aircraft, balloon, or a celestial object!"],"Case Number":"50815","Date of the Event":"09/13/2013 10:08 UTC","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50815.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09142013-0005"}
