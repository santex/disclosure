{"Case Number":"15201","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Fredericktown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsOne morning in late December, 2007, before dawn, at 7:10am, as I was driving to work, I noticed a line of very bright white lights in the sky above the fields northwest of Fredericktown, Ohio. It was a very dark, foggy morning, and driving was difficult both because of the fog and other drivers��� headlights following closely behind me. I was on Ohio State Route 13, headed north, at about the point where the highway narrows from four lanes into two and curves, first to the right and then back to the left, juse north of Fredericktown, when I first saw this horizontal line of six or eight white lights (I don���t remember exactly how many). They were very bright, equally spaced apart, and seemingly stationary. It was impossible to tell whether they were very close to me and low to the ground, or very far away and high above the ground, but from my vantage point they appeared to be about 300 feet above the ground and maybe a half-mile or so distant. They did not move, or change position in relationship to the ground or to each other as I followed the road around the two curves. I lost sight of them as I traveled further north on the highway. I do not know if I lost sight of them because of the fog, or because I had traveled past them, and they were now behind me, or because they were no longer there. Because of the traffic behind me, I could not drive much slower than I already was, or pull over to watch them. As I said, it was very foggy, a low, patchy ground fog, and these lights appeared to be well above the fog. The only rational explanation I can offer is that it was the landing lights of a formation of two C-130 aircraft from the Air National Guard (or perhaps a single aircraft, given the configuration of the landing lights on the wings of that aircraft) going to land at Lahm Field in Mansfield. As a pilot, I have seen the landing lights of large aircraft when they are at a great distance and headed directly towards me, and they appear to be stationary for a time, but eventually they will disappear because the aircraft turns or goes behind a cloud layer. These lights ��� if they were aircraft landing lights ��� appeared very much brighter and larger than I had before seen on distant aircraft, indicating that they were very close. But, if they were close, I should have been able to see the red and green navigation lights on the wingtips, and the flashing red beacons or strobes on the fuselages, as well as movement. I thought at first that it might be a blimp ��� the Goodyear blimp is stationed nearby in Akron, and I see it fly by several times a year, on its way to cover a football game somewhere ��� but I cannot think why one would be flying cross country at night, or in this weather and at this time of the year in this area. Furthermore, I have never seen this arrangement of lights on a blimp, and a blimp would also have red and green navigation lights. Besides that, both C-130���s and blimps are noisy aircraft. The thought occurred to me that it might be going to attempt a crash landing on the highway, so I put down the window so I could see more clearly and so I could hear whatever it was, but there was no sound besides that made by my own tires on the road."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.540721","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15201.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.481172,+-82.540721(15201)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15201) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/27/2007 07:10 UTC","Summary":"Line of 6 or 8 very bright white lights in sky, motionless.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fredericktown","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"12/27/2007 07:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01302009-0006","Latitude":"40.481172"}
