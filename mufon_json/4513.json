So, Naturally, we wanted to watch, and find out what it was. So we watched through the bay windows, as the light, in a tear-drop-like shape seemed to decent rappidly as it grew larger in size. Then, out of no where, it slowly faded to where it was barely visable, and vaguely resembled airplane lights, but in a differant pattern and in the wrong placements, then flew upward, and over in an eastward direction.
