I remember it took longer than it normaly would. weeks later, i took my film in to get it developed and found an odd picture. As i looked at it, i started to remember what had happened. its pretty crazy....anyway you can have this picture if you want it. It looks like a red glowing arch. I'm guessing its about 100 feet away from where i was when i took the picture. I have misplaced the negative. I can send it to you if you let me know where? P.S.
