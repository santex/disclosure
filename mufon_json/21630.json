I would calculate altitude around 8 thousand feet based on airliners passing overhead continously during the day over 10 thousand feet. The sky is clear, cool, light breeze. I called my wife out to see it and the object made a smooth 45 degree turn towards the east for about 3 seconds then turned just as smoothly towards a southern direction. No sound, no anti-collision lights, just one big yellowish sphere. This object was bigger than the current planets out tonight or any star on the Orion Constellation. As it moved south it just dimmed out and dissappeared. As big and bright as this thing was it would have been visible for another 2 or 3 minutes as it moved along. Even my dog just stared at it."],"Date of the Event":"01/24/2010 07:28 UTC","Longitude":"-97.490234","City":"Brownsville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.905347,+-97.490234(21630)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21630) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/24/2010 09:08 UTC","Log Number":"US-01242010-0023"}
