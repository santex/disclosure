He said he was in his house when he heard buzzing noise in his front yard. when he looked out a UFO had set down in his front yard. He saw lights but no aleins. after a few minutes it left. He had no doubt that it was a UFO.( we do have an airforces base here also) Afterwards pertrified stone and wood coulds be found where the crsft had sat down. after about 12-15 years a perfect circle can still be seen in the front yard. the best time to see this is in the summer because the grass grows diffrent there. My grandfather reported it to the radio station and to the news, but they did not follow up on it. he also notified Law enforce we also did not follow up on it. My mother just told me about this yesterday when i was helping here move into his house . since my Grand Fathers death"],"Longitude":"-88.824256","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"20602"}
