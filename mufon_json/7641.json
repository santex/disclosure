As I got closer to home, I noticed it had flown over my general neighborhood area, and was traveling west toward Williamsfield Airport. It appeared as if it came from the Superstition Mountain Area. Normally I would have been more sceptical, but this was no known aircraft. The object appeared to be black, but it was night time so it could have been any dark color. The white lights could be described as almost searchlights of high power. There was also a flashing red light in the center of the bottom of the object. Also of note, but possibly just coincidence was a unusually visible falling star(meteorite) appearing before I saw the object. This is my testimony of what I saw."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"08/09/2007 09:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.253664,+-111.632879(7641)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7641) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7641.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7641.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Three bright lights equidistant triangle pattern, very slow moving, silent","Log Number":"US-08112007-0002","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-111.632879","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
