It was a very clear night (no haze or overcast). The light seemed to be at the hight of a commercial jet but being at night it was difficult to tell. As the light moved more directly overhead I saw a stream of green light project from one side. Seconds later a red boomerang shaped object appeared to the rear and to the left of the bright light. This continued until the object reached about 2:30 in the eastern sky. It then suddenly dissapeared."],"Log Number":"US-11102009-0013","Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20437.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20437.html"],"Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-105.775707","Latitude":"39.556591","Tags":"City","Case Number":"20437","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed"}
