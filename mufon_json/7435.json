{"Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approx 1:54 am tonight 7-14-07 was coming home in coldwater and happened to see a bright orange flash to my right. I looked up amd saw what looked like a hung ball on fire (or the color of flames) way up in the sky. It was flashing as though it was on fire traveling about 10 miles an hour floating to the north east direction. It never changed speed and at one point it appeared to have falling dabree that as it fell, burned itself out as it floated towards earth. I am not a drinker by the way. Wondering if you got any other reports on this? I did send this email to channel 3 news. My friend that was with me as he was driving also saw this. His name is Spenecr Brayton. It was comning from the direction of Bater road where over the past quite a few years has had many numerious reported sitings with one possable abduction. Thank you."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"07/14/2007 01:54 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/14/2007 01:54 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.321244,+-85.598364(7435)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7435) map </A>","Case Number":"7435","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7435.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7435.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Summary":"round ball like then to star shape","Longitude":"-85.598364","Latitude":"44.321244","Log Number":"US-07142007-0002"}
