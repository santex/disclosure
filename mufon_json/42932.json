I received a phone call from the witness, who had reported UFO sightings and ���monster screams��� on previous occasions. He said: \"I have video of a craft which I took last night. It looked like fireworks at first, but there was no noise or explosion. At first it stayed in a ball, then the little flares multiplied and turned into a craft. I mentally told it to turn to the right. It came closer, then turned to the right and fizzled out. I also took some video of my friends who also saw the UFO, asking them how they felt while they were seeing it. I could go on Google Maps, and plot the direction it headed. The moon is also in the video. My cell phone is a Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch, with an 8 megapixel camera. I wonder if I could get, say, $5 for this video?\" I told him I didn���t know of any good way to get money for videos. I asked him whether he would be willing to report this to the MUFON website or if he would like for me to. He said he would like for me to. I asked the witness if he could email the videos to me. He isn���t sure if he can email them. The UFO video is 26 Mb. [The Email limit may be 25 Mb.-WIM] I suggested he might split it into two overlapping videos. He said this might degrade the quality. He needs to repair his computer before he can email the videos to me, he said."],"Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42932.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42932.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"42932","Log Number":"US-09302012-0025","Latitude":"44.798835","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Minnesota","City":"Chaska","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.798835,+-93.593499(42932)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42932) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Fireworks-like ball put out flares, turned into craft which came closer, disintegrated.","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
