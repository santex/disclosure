[one of the daughters is the wife of a college president. we were privileged to work together at a college a few years back.] anyway--later on we talked to my older brother. he was one of two government advisors back then, over the manned space project. when we started to tell him the story in southern ca, he separated us into two rooms and had us draw a picture and explain what happened. we gave them to him later on, and he said, \"i'll see that general lemay gets these.\" he was to be in a meeting with him later that month. the next time i talked to my brother, he assured me that he had given those two papers to lemay, who was then the general over the u s air force. lemay, dave said, glanced at the pictures and said, \"oh, yes. we know about these. they aren't terrestrial.\" they had a further conversation i will not include here. if i'd seen this by myself, i would never have told anyone...."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-89.093678","Summary":"It looked like a bowl facing down on top of a saucer--with \"windows.\"","City":"Vandalia","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.960601,+-89.093678(13168)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13168) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-10222008-0014","Date of the Event":"10/15/1966 10:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Vandalia","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"10/15/1966 10:00 UTC","Latitude":"38.960601","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13168.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13168.html"],"Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","Case Number":"13168"}
