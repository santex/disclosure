I felt like this thing was looking at me through the skylight.It looked to be about as the size of the full moon, however it was difficult to discern the distance, it seemed not more than 50 to 100 feet above my house. I only saw it for about 20 seconds then it disappeared. My Mom and Stepdad were in the main bedroom and were awakened by the sound of a doorbell and noise in the room next door. I do not have a doorbell and nobody lives next door. I went outside with a flashlight and got the landlord to look around with me. it was very silent outside and overcast and we found no trace of anything. Right after this thing disappeared it shook the house. I am not sure what this thing was but it seemed to have an intelligence as I felt like it was trying to communicate with me."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Very Bright Amber Sphere","Log Number":"US-03242008-0010","Region":"Washington","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Gig Harbor","There were no other sightings in Gig Harbor on or around May 10th 2006"],"Date Submitted":"05/10/2006 01:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/10/2006 01:00 UTC","City":"Gig Harbor","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10032.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10032.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10032.html"],"Longitude":"-122.580129","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"47.329264"}
