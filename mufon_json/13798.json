Then it went straight again and faded out to nothing. When this was happening I pulled my daughter over to see it, she saw it just as it was zig zagging and said it was silver. It was heading East South East at the time and we observed it at about a 60 degree angle. I am a trained observer from the military so the behavior was not any aircraft or satellite that I know of."],"Date of the Event":"11/18/2008 06:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.584395,+-98.305846(13798)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13798) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Selma","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Selma","There were no other sightings in Selma on or around November 18th 2008"]}
