{"Longitude":"-79.230252","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I had been out for a walk and just came back to our house, I sat down on the porch when my eyes went to the sky above my neighbours house across the street. I had spotted a bright light that was flashing blue and red and white. I was trying to decifer the size of it because it looked larger than a star and planet. I asked my son to get my husband and come out to see it. He also saw it along with my son and couldnt understand what it was. The UFO had moved very slowly behind some trees but we still tracked it. By some time, maybe five to ten minutes my neighbour drove in to his driveway and I alerted him to this UFO. We couldnt see it over at our house so we went into his backyard and saw it keep moving further to the west. He saw the flashing lights and also saw it emit a strobe like light. Finally no conclusion on what we saw.It kept moving west and objects were in our way.I think we all would like to know what this was, I really would like to know if anyone saw this."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ontario","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","City":"Toronto","Summary":"SAW AN OBJECT FLASHING IN SKY ABOVE MY NEIGHBOURS HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET WHILE SITTING ON MY PORCH","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.785786,+-79.230252(47110)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47110) map </A>","Log Number":"CA-05012013-0018","Case Number":"47110","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.785786","Date Submitted":"05/01/2013 11:06 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around May 1st 2013"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Date of the Event":"05/01/2013 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47110.html"]}
