I was on my back porch looking at the stars due east. A large object traveling at unimaginable speed crossed the sky, from southwest to north east. I saw a multy colored streak across the sky that was moving at incredible speed, mostly yellowish color, and it was very wide, and very fast, and on a very straight line.It really freaked me out, and soon after , mabey a couple seconds later, a falling star went by on a similar path but a whole lot slower. I watch the sky's around here all the time, and this is the first time I have seen something go by that I can't explain."],"Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Ashland","There were no other sightings in Ashland on or around November 13th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.486704","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20568.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20568.html"]}
