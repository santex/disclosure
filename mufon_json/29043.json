The weather condition was windy I thought it might be bird at first but it was close enough that naked eye could make out it shape, no wings then i thought it was a ballon becasue of its shape but balloons dont fly in a straight line. I watched it for about 20 to 45 seconds before it disappered into the horizon. It was very quick moving about the air."],"Latitude":"41.686281","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in South Bend","There were no other sightings in South Bend on or around May 9th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
