There's an intersection going east to Crider road with a field on either side. I was looking out towards the south, and I noticed a green light shooting down towards the earth. My first thought was a firework or a meteor, when it shot upwards and started zigzagging. It was right over the field, so it wasn't much more than a 100 feet or less from me. It would shoot down and almost touch the earth then shoot back up and zig for a bit. It lasted for several seconds before it went black and flew away. If everyone would report their sightings in that area, and to the west of Cordell in Burns Flat, there would be thousands of sightings every year. Everyone I knew in that area saw something."],"Summary":"greenish ball, about 6 feet in circumference","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8121.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8121.html"],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere","trends":["There have been no other sightings in New Cordell","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/15/2003 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-98.988333","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oklahoma","Date Submitted":"10/15/2003 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Latitude":"35.294722","Log Number":"US-10122007-0003","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","City":"New Cordell"}
