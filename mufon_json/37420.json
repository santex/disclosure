It was a spherical object, and we noticed it from the balcony of my in-laws flat. It was darting in and out of a dark grey storm cloud at odd angles of trajectory, and at great speed. It did this for about 2-3 minutes. I witnessed it again about 5 minutes later, but this time it was moving faster and had a visible trail behind it. We all lost sight of it after then, and the storm clouds dissipaited about 15 minutes later."],"Summary":"Observed a UFO during a storm darting through clouds at speed.","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"GB-04122012-0024","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37420.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37420.html"],"trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around April 12th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Region":"England","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"51.514509","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
