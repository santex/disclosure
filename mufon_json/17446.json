There was about 4 other people looking at it from the car was. I saw these guys looking up at the sky and asked them what they were looking at and they said there was something in the clouds that was not moving. I am a veteran of the Air-Foce. I have seen two UFO's in my life time. I am now, age 63. I saw another UFO aorund 1960 while I was fishing off the beach at night with my neighbors, the Williams. We all saw it hovering on the horizon, just a bright light, then it shot off into the sky and disappeared. It had to have been a UFO. No air plane could have done that. The movement was similiar to that of Betty and Barie Hill. It rose fore a short distance, came back down, then shot up into the sky.
