Too big for a star 5X the size of a star. I got my binoculars and saw it was made up of three balls. One on the bottom and two on top with a small space between the top two spheres.It didn't move for 15 min. Then it started backing off and turning gold to yellow. Then it got smaller and smaller until it was gone. My Step-son and Wife saw it also.
