We followed it and it seemingly \"burned out\" and disappeared. Not even a minute later, Another fireball came from the same area as the first again burning out where the first one had. This occurred again two more times, all originating from the same spot and burning out in the same vicinity. This occurred over the span of approximately 7 - 10 minutes.
