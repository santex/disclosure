Then all of Sudden,I was like\"uh do you see that?\" Then I said, oh it's a satellite. Just as I said that it gave off a bright white flash of light. Then we looked each other and I was like that's too fast to be a satellite. So then I came and got my phone and googled where the satellite was and it said not in this area tonight. We are in SE Portland oregon by mall 205. Then I tried looking on twitter with no luck, so I came here.the plane and the ufo flew off to the north and disappeared. I'm pretty sure a satellite would have taken at least 5 minutes to move the same length as this did in one minute or less.hopefully we're not the only ones to see it."],"Case Number":"48490","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like"}
