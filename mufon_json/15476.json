Turned into the drive. Got out of car continued to observe the object (orange ball glowing star-like, wholly unlike a fixed or rotary winged aircraft). This was also viewed by three other family members. Managed to observe through 8 x 40 binoculars, however unable to discern additional detail. The object moved silently and relatively slowly on a slightly curved course travelling roughly East South East veering South and seemed to gain altitude and fade out of sight, pulsating slightly as it did so. I have seen two of these objects before (late December 2008 and early January 2009), which I reported to MUFON in early January 2009. I experienced no impact on feelings during the sighting, remaining calm and rational."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/13/2009 09:05 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.384019,+-1.467415(15476)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15476) map </A>","Longitude":"-1.467415","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange coloured glowing ball moving slowly across the night sky in a roughly south south westerly direction."}
