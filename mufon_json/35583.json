Less then 500 yards away. I havent seen a UFO in weeks. Was looking up and saw a white orb like UFO zoom slow speed below clouds in a straight line. It slowed down when it was getting into the same area as a plane that was going to the near by air port. The UFO was not as high up as the plane. Once it got say beside the plane when looking up.(but was way under it. The UFO slowed down and cut right. Went threw a cloud and stayed there over my property. It turned a light orange color once it cut right. When it was over my property it stayed there for a few minutes then disappeared. I saw a really low huge cargo plane today as well. (around 2)So low I thought it was going to crash into the mountain. But I never saw it explode or go over the mountain. Weird. Then a black helicopter(around 4:30). Lots of helicopters lately. We had five here very low about a week ago.
