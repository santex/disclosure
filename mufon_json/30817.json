{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis took place at 11:55. I had just set my alarm clock, so i knew the exact time. I walked across my room to shut a window. I looked out the window and saw in the western sky, a large ball of pulsating light. I noted that the object was similar to another that had been seen earlier this year. The only exception to its similarity was the size. In my previous sighting the object was 2x as large and the object lit the room through curtains waking me up. This recent incident had a much longer duration. I watched the object fly for approximately 7 minutes. While it flew it pulsated green, yellow, blue, orange, and white colors. Of course I assumed that this was an air plane, then realized that there had been strong storms during the day and were forcasted for the night, that no planes coming from a very small air port 23 miles away. That air port is also across a mountain pass that is over 6,000 feet in elevation. The object disappeared when a flash of lightning struck near the home. I watched the sky and the object was gone."],"Longitude":"-112.100341","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30817.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30817.html"],"City":"Whitehall","Latitude":"45.873216","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"A large orb of pulsating light with high rate of speed with sharp directional change","Case Number":"30817","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/11/2011 07:01 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/10/2011 11:55 UTC","Log Number":"US-08112011-0015","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Montana","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Whitehall","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.873216,+-112.100341(30817)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30817) map </A>"}
