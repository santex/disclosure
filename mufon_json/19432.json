Then it appeared as it was getting foggy and it got dimmer until it disappeared. We only got to see it for a few seconds. I was reaching for my camera phone, but it was gone before I could get it out. It was stationary in the sky. It looked just like a star, that switched on a spotlight and then the whole thing just faded away."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 09:43 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.890901,+-77.476658(19432)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19432) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cone, Star-like","Summary":"Star with spotlight","Object Features":"None","City":"Millheim","Disposition":"IFO"}
