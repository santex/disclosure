I was on the couch watching the film ���Police Academy��� when they called me. I came out on the deck and they pointed out what they were seeing for me to cooberate with them. Tom Maat & Amberrose Hammond had been watching this for about 3 minutes before I came out. We all saw an object floating in the sky through the tree line in front of us. It was flying in all sorts of random patterns within, from our vantage point, at least a mile distance from left to right. It was very difficult to discern the distance it was away from us, but upon further inspection after the event, we drove out to the approximate area we think it was hovering and it was about 2 miles southwest from where we saw it from. We watched it for about five minutes and Tom Maat grabbed his camera to take some video and pictures. Tom started filming at 11:33 PM and filmed until 11:36 PM. The craft continuously just kept flying in erratic patterns randomly up and down and from side to side. I note that it was also doing ���dive-bombs��� back and forth kind of like a skateboarder does on a ���half-pipe��� styled ramp when they ride it. Tom Maat also took some still photos capturing the anomaly in a couple of the frames. It seemed to disappear at around 11:37 PM. We still stood and watched the sky and then it came back after about five minutes. This time, while it was still doing all the random maneuvers it seemed to get a little closer to us and saw some detail. I saw red, white, and green light emitting from it. I could not see any type of shape but Amberrose noted it looked like a rectangle. . This lasted for about another 5 minutes and then the object disappeared."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.069333,+-86.226966(14305)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14305) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/28/2008 11:25 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-86.226966","Object Features":"Wings","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"UFO sighting over Grand Haven, Michigan.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12082008-0013"}
