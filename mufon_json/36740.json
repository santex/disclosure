I noticed a very bright star over my roofline and continued to watch it trying to identify it. I realized that there were lights pulsating on it in red and blue and it was hovering and moving in somewhat of a zigzag motion on and off. I brought my son-in-law outside and he observed what I had and we watched the object for about 10 minutes longer when my 16 year old son (a genius but a real skeptic) joined us. At first, he tried to write it off as some type of star but then saw the pulsating lights and could no longer call it a star. We continued to watch and he noticed the movement and hovering of the object. The object was changing altitudes throughout. We went inside to see if there was anything in the area that may be causing this and when we returned outside a short time later, it was gone."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Looked at first to be a very bright star then noticed pulsating lights and zigzag movements","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"35.827165","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/25/2012 08:44 UTC","City":"Murfreesboro","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Murfreesboro","There were no other sightings in Murfreesboro on or around March 24th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"36740","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Tennessee","Log Number":"US-03252012-0024","Longitude":"-86.458203","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.827165,+-86.458203(36740)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36740) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
