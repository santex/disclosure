This particular night there were 2 bright lights flying alongside each other. At first I thought they were stars when I pointed them out to my husband, but they had no tails on them, then I thought they were satellites. They made absolutely no noise. As they flew over us they started weaving in and out of each other and could fly in any which direction they wanted, and quickly. They eventually flew East until they were no longer in our sight. Their behaviour almost seemed playful. My husband and I were in a state of shock for several minutes afterwards, we had never seen anything like it!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"49.267036","Date of the Event":"08/11/2010 10:40 UTC","Tags":"City"}
