finally as they realized what they were seeing, they stood near me and were watching in shock as well. they were like \"what is that\" and \"it's ufos\" and they were laughing in a nervous way of when you see something that is incredible and shouldn't be happening in waking life, it must be something strange indeed. the guy said something along the lines of \"it's bats and there's light from the moon reflecting off of them\", but i quickly countered, saying that they were too big to be seen from such a great height, and the movements they were making, coming to a standstill then moving in reverse, is impossible for them to do. to which he replied \"i know\", more or less saying \"my reasoning is maxed out and i don't know how to explain what i'm seeing to rationalize this to myself and these women i'm with\". i joked saying \"it must be swamp gas\", to which they laughed. i of course was referencing the explanations given by government officials when trying to explain away such events. they usually will try to explain such events as \"natural occurrences\", which usually to most of the time doesn't work sufficiently. this continued for about 10 minutes total, about 3 minutes with my sister and i, then about 7 or so minutes with the 3 strangers and myself. i took one photo and it had a flash, so it didn't come out well, though it does look like some kind of light ball is present. in hindsight i should of turned off the flash, take a bunch of photos, then worked with them to see if i could improve visibility, but alas i did not. the saving grace is that this occurred with me and 4 different people! then as those people were walking away after the lights started to leave and there were less and less, i noticed other people at the coffee shop looking, just following what we were doing, so at least 1, maybe 2 other people saw this separate of me, which is great and makes this occurrence that much more than a chance of my \"imagination'. seeing something like this, as i said to my sister, puts us on a short list, as it's not every day you see a real, genuine ufo sighting. once in the moment of such an event, it is chilling, exciting and just plain awe-inspiring, as you realize you are seeing something that is beyond the scope of day to day existence. being north carolina, there is always the chance this was military testing, such as of the aurora space craft, which is supposed to be able to take off from earth and go all the way to the moon, though the physics these things displayed had a fluidity of fish in water, and a grace of fish underwater, which is best way to explain them, like fish at play, doing something of a delicate game or ballet in it's precision, with no moment of fear of \"collision\", it was truly stunning and if it's the only time i have such an experience, it will have made all the research i've done up till now worthwhile i have one picture that is very dark as it is the flash at night, but it appears to be the lights with the clouds, though it is very dark, once viewed knowing what you are looking at, 2 of the objects (possibly 3) are somewhat visible. it is a strange photo, wish i took some without the flash!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42002.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42002.html"],"trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Winston-Salem","There were no other sightings in Winston-Salem on or around August 24th 2012"],"City":"Winston-Salem","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/24/2012 09:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"North Carolina","Summary":"siting of 8-10 lights next to moon, seen from Winston-Salem, NC","Case Number":"42002","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
