They appeared as two really large stars, then kind of melded together and I called my daughter and her boyfriend outside. They watched it and at first thought it was just a really large star, but then it appeared to have some kind of tail like a comet. There was a kind of tail of fire behind it. It remained in the same place the entire time I was outside (until approx 11 pm) and never changed location. It just rotates and kind of changes shape."],"Case Number":"11574","Longitude":"-94.128814","City":"Springdale","Region":"Arkansas","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.186744,+-94.128814(11574)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11574) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07152008-0006","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11574.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11574.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
