We tracked it moving at a steady pace maybe 600' off the ground heading in the direction of the fireworks. 6-7 witnesses. Viewed it thru my bushnell 4x30 binoculars. Appeared to be a bright orange light with a flat bottom. Flew from eat to west. Eventually got behind trees and lost sight of it."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Sioux City","There were no other sightings in Sioux City on or around June 30th 2012"],"Longitude":"-96.345038","Case Number":"39974","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07012012-0003","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Iowa","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.467325,+-96.345038(39974)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39974) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/01/2012 12:32 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/30/2012 09:47 UTC","City":"Sioux City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"42.467325","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Other, Unknown"}
