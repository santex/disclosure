As he looked up from under the porch, he saw an orange ball of light from which a smaller light came from the bottom of it and moved to the left creating another (2nd) orange light. This cycle happened 2 more times within an approximate 10 second time span. Witness went inside to call his wife out, but by then, the lights had vanished. Witness described the light as being \"ten o'clock high\". The light was a little East of Dublin and was moving from the South to the North from the witnesses perspective. Witness indicated that the light in relation to speed, was \"just idling along.\" Witness remembers that jets were \"around\" the light at the time. After the disapearence of the lights, the jets could still be heard. Witness further stated that jets dog-fight, drop chaff and flares, and perform missle-avoidance training over Lake Proctor very frequently."],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"20806","Date of the Event":"11/18/2009 08:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.091363,+-98.338788(20806)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20806) map </A>","Summary":"4 orange lights in series","Date Submitted":"11/30/2009 11:33 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20806.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20806.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dublin","There were 2 other sightings in Dublin on or around November 18th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown"}
