Upon coming to the end of the driveway looking across an open field I noticed a bright white tube shaped light that seem to appear above the tree line.I was yelling for my kids to look at the object but they were busy talking. As I watched it shoot across the skyline at an immense speed from East to West. At first I thought it was a meteor but it was too low in the sky. As it traveled at a very high rate of speed it suddenly made 40-45 degree angle upwards and disappeared mid sky. The feeling I had afterward was sheer excitement. I have lived near the Aberdeen Proving Grounds for 42 yrs of my life and have seen my share of strange objects in the sky.Although the proving grounds does not test airplanes it does test weapons.So I am very sure that what I saw was not of military origin."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-76.639491","Date of the Event":"11/09/2009 07:10 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"long \"neon\" tube appeared in sky over APG Aberdeen Proving Grounds.","Latitude":"39.055055"}
