{"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["sighting details walking home from the grocery store i looked up to the n-ne at what i thought might be a cluster of high flying birds. that's when i noticed a second cluster appearing below them. as that cluster appeared the first disappeared. they were white or silver; a color that reflected light well. i tried pretty hard to establish that these were birds but i could not distinguish the form of any bird i've ever seen. from my experience, if it is a bird and it's close enough to see then it's close enough to tell if it is, in fact, a bird. \"what the @#$% is that?\" i asked my wife, who was walking with me. she looked up and saw what i was seeing. by this time we realized that these things were much higher and moving much faster than birds. the first cluster that i noticed was just to the left of the moon but the many that were appearing at different points in the sky as we watched were further to the north, some were lower in the sky and even directly overhead. we were both carrying groceries so we had to take them inside and we wanted to get other peoples attention so we could ensure that others had seen it as well but we were both mesmerized for a moment before we could bring ourselves to lose line of sight. we ran into our apartment as fast as we could and yelled out to our roommate to go outside. we put the groceries down and followed him. sure enough, the objects were still in the sky; still alternating appearing and reappearing in clusters. \"some of them seem to be flashing.\" he said. i looked closer and noticed that a few of the objects had a slight strobe effect. at this point they started flying in formations. first a 'v' configuration from a couple of separate groups. my roommate later recalled some more basic shapes that were formed mainly during transition; a straight line, a diamond shape and others. one 'v' formation passed directly overhead, it was really, really high up and far away; it disappeared seconds after it appeared. during all of this activity i noticed that six individual dots separated from the group and formed a circle or a six pointed star standing vertical apparently visible from the north or south. it wasn't hovering but rotating counter clockwise and moving to the west like a wheel rolling in the sky. i shouted at some strangers who were minding their own business and they ignored me so i turned around to knock on a friend's door; sacrificing line of sight to get another witness. when i turned around they were gone. my wife had gone to put away the groceries and my roommate had to go sit down because he was experiencing some discomfort. the overhead 'v' formation pointed to the north and they all seemed to be disappearing\\reappearing in that direction so it's my guess that's the direction they headed. i would have imagined more people would have seen them but it was kind of like they were following i-35. afterwards i noticed a resemblance to much of what has been sighted in mexico and south and central america. i didn't recognize the parallel between the circular pattern rotating while moving and the wheel but it strikes me as important. project paperclip would have definitely chalked this one up as \"high-flying birds\"."],"Latitude":"30.275523","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Middle of the afternoon, looked up at the moon (it was visible) saw several large clusters of shiny specks moving rapidly high to the NE. The clusters alternated changing invisible, some changing colors from red, orange and silver/white.","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Longitude":"-97.739591","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"10487","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10487.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10487.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10487.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other,Unknown","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There was one other sighting in Austin on or around April 16th 2008"],"Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"04/16/2008 04:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Austin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.275523,+-97.739591(10487)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10487) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other, Unknown","Log Number":"US-04232008-0010","Date of the Event":"04/16/2008 04:15 UTC"}
