Me and my family finally went in to the house, but me being still confused at what I saw, went back out about 15 minutes later and saw 3 high flying aircraft jets, the kind that are up about 30 to 35,000 feet, and leave contrails..All three were heading east to west and were side x side faned out across the sky, the first thing that came to mind was that they were surveying the sky where I noticed these objects. After they passed I didn't notice any thing out of the ordinary...AQ"],"Longitude":"-104.700772","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.432644,+-104.700772(8096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8096) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8096.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8096.html"],"Case Number":"8096","City":"Greeley","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Greeley","There were no other sightings in Greeley on or around October 6th 2007"]}
