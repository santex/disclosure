It was white-amber in color and traveling NE then East. It was moving slowly (like it was just floating) in the sky and it was so quiet. It must of been large and very high but it seemed like it was about 100 feet above my head....probably because it was so bright. The sighting from start to finish lasted about 5 minutes. When it travelled away from me to the East it must of picked up speed because it disappeared in an instant. I took 8 photos with my iPhone 3 but all are poor quality."]}
