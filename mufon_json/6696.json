as strange as it sounds, i could sooner believe it was a space ship with little green men before i could believe there would be a helicopter out there. i know we had helicopters that were being used in korea at the time, but i had never seen one in person, and that explanation never crossed my mind at the time ... but again, what would one be doing out there in rural america? i'm sorry if this is a waste of your time, but maybe someone else saw something back then and you already know about it. i don't think i want to know if it was just a helicopter - i've always been pleased that i saw something and i've pretended all these years that it was, in fact, a real honest to goodness ufo. and i am a believer. i've just not yet been lucky enough to really see anything important - well, actually i did see a model of russia's sputnik in their pavillion at the brussel's world fair in 1958. i was an exchange student at the time. i'm 66 years old now, but maybe someday.........in the meantime, i faithfully watch all the ufo programs on the history channel and long to know what it's all about, and wish i lived near a \"hot spot\". i'm glad there is an organization that takes this stuff seriously and people who are willing to come forward with their stories. thank you."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/01/1951 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-84.185214","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6696.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6696.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"In the early 50s a yellow/greenish light dropped slowly from high in the east to the west at a 45 degree angle"}
