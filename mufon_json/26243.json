(?) then around 2am friday morning oct. 29 i saw a \"star\" very, very high up sail across the length of the sky until it disappeared. and then saturday 6:15pm (+\\-15 min.) a fireball sailed across the eastern sky moving north. things of this nature have occurred off and on since i moved here in jan. of 2008. in the beginning i reported but haven't done so in a long time. but i hope that maybe others in the area might read this and post their sightings in this area too."],"Summary":"Lights and fire balls Land O Lakes, FL","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26243.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26243.html"],"Case Number":"26243","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
