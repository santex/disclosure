The sky was clear, there were no clouds and my visual scope was clear from left to right. There also were no buildings or trees etc. to block my sight. Even if it were a plane , i would've been able to see it further-away in the sky. This really got my attention. I nearly drove into the next car ,cause I was so puzzled, fyi there was alot of traffic, we were moving very slowly, about 1 car length. I did keep looking for this object, I even thought during my first initial sight \" that looks strange take a picture, even with my phone\" but again it was not visible anymore. The main reason I am reporting this is cause I am alittle confused as to what I saw, and if anyone else in my area reported anything? I also like to mention I drive a convertible so my visual span was very wide. Had this thing not disappeared, I might have shrugged it off , but it clearly was not anywhere around my airspace. I also live near LAX and don't cry wolf everytime i see a light in the sky. I would also like to say my reason for looking up all the time is because in 1984(apprx ) in yonkers, ny on the toconic pkwy, cross county pkwy at around 1:30-am i did witness a BLACK square-edged BOOMERANG OBJECT , had 5 white lights, no nose, no tail, was very low , gliding slowly, floating, I LITERALLY stopped my car on the 4 lane highway, got out and just stared at this huge , soundless thing, floating...... thinking how can it float so slow and not fall down? i flashed my lights high-beam, and i swear it started to turn and head towards the pkwy. as a couple of cars passed, i was pointing up, and they also stopped , but we did not speak, they stopped up the road , ahead of where i was. as it came over the pkwy, is when i was thinking what is this, i crossed out all logical answers, and then noticed it had no nose , and no tail, like planes do, no red or grn lights, made no noise, and was so big i could not see the stars (sky ) while it was over me.. then it just turned back towards the direction it came from. i saw the underneath of it, it looked like the ceiling of an industrial plant.. pipes, crevices, tubing.. etc.. This is the moment in my life when the word UFO had a new meaning, and i no longer think ufo is a saucer, and unidentified flying object (ufo) means exactly what it stands for. as i stood out my car i got a rush of panic , i got very afraid suddenly and jumped in my car , and started to leave, i kept looking back as it floated away, again turning my head back to look, and forward , acouple of times, but the last time i looked back it was gone. i dont think it disappeared, i think due to the shape , at a certain angle it blends with the sky. hence only a certain radius see the objects ... anyway thank-you for this opportunity to tell you my story. P.S. when i got home it was 1.5 hrs later then it should have been...??? i think i have lost time, people think im crazy when i tell'em my story, but no gain has come from my experience except my friends think im crazy.. and i lost a couple of dates ..."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Tube like object flying across sky, caught my eye, looked away for 2 sec. looked back , object was gone.. no clouds , and open sky, left to right no plane or object insight , almost crashed cause I was confused.","Latitude":"34.07924","Date of the Event":"05/19/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-118.398116","Weather Factors":"Fog","Date Submitted":"05/19/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","City":"Beverly Hills"}
