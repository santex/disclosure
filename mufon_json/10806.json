There being a full moon just to the right of this light I thought it may be a planet...but it was WAY too bright. My home is in the northwest of Reno, close to the earthquake epicenters and this bright object was to the southeast, just south of the downtown. I peeked a few more times before I went to bed around 1:45, the same time we had another 3.0 earthquake, stupid earthquakes...and the light was still there. So I go out tonight around midnight and this amazing bright \"planet\" has disappeared...in just 24 hours. Go figure...I have no idea of the size nor the elevation, it never moved, it only glowed bright. When I adjusted my binoculars in and out of focus I really couldn't hold them still enough. But when they were extremely out of focus I picked up diamond shapes in a circle in a regular pattern."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10806.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10806.html"],"Region":"Nevada","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-119.806693","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
