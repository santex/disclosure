It was a ball of light that fell at a 45 degree angle and then abruptly turned left at a 90 degree angle and just kinda darted all around before disipearring. We looked at each other and said, \"Did you see that\"? At first when it was desending I thought it was a meteor, then it turned, I knew then it was not a meteor! It happened really fast. It looked like the ball of light that decended over the wailing wall in Jerusalem and actually acted in the same manner."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"02/01/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.734827,+-94.939938(30440)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30440) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Longitude":"-94.939938","Case Number":"30440","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30440.html"],"Latitude":"32.734827"}
