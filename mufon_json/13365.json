{"Date of the Event":"10/28/2008 07:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Palo Pinto","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on side of HWY 16 just north of Possum Kingdom Lake. Earlier I had watched through binoculars three separate orange lights that appeared to be jets with landing lights on moving west from DFW. As the jets switched to regular lights I was about to pull out of an dirt road and stopped to make sure no traffic was coming. I happened to look south where the jets should of been and right at that moment three (one on left separated by maybe half a fist to two other objects on the right) bright orange lights appeared. They were in the southern sky, maybe 20-25��� up from the ground. Put the binoculars on them immediately - I had a camera but I knew that I had no good chance since it is an older digital and does not do well in low light. I watched both objects; on the right there were two dots - the dot on right would 'disappear' and then reappear to the left of the first dot. It did that 2-3 times. The other object on the left was a bigger dot, bigger than Venus looks now in the sky. As I watched it, another orange ball appeared to come out of the main object and move away just a little bit, and then another (I think) came 'out' of it as well. I was FREAKED because I had finally seen something I had always watched for! They did not move, just sat there and did what they did. And then they just blinked out and were gone. I stayed and watched a little more but that was it. The previous report I had filed with MUFON turned out to be a really big weather balloon. This damned sure was no weather balloon or anything I have seen before."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/28/2008 07:45 UTC","Case Number":"13365","Log Number":"US-10292008-0026","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13365.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13365_submitter_file1__sighting.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13365.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two separate bright orange lights, single one on left turned into two-three separate objects","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.767986,+-98.298754(13365)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13365) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Palo Pinto","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.767986","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.298754","Source":"MUFON"}
