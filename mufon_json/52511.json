{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside to have a cigarette before bed, when I saw 5 or 6 very bright orange objects flying across the eastern sky, just below Jupiter and the Gemini constellation. They seemed almost fuzzy to look at, but very bright. 2 of the lights remained the same brightness, but the others would brighten then slowly dim out. They were following each other, for the most part, but the smaller ones seemed to stay close together, and they were the ones that dimmed out. I looked around in the sky and saw 3 jets behind these lights, at some distance, but headed in the same direction, towards the north. There were 2 more jets flying at high altitudes in opposite directions. The objects didnt appear to make any sound. After a few minutes had passed another bright orange light flew in the same direction and slowly faded away as the others, and I saw 2 more jets right after that - both headed north east."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"52511","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"11/29/2013 09:55 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Jefferson","There were no other sightings in Jefferson on or around November 29th 2013"],"Longitude":"-94.337423","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52511.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52511.html"],"Summary":"5 or 6 orange lights dart across sky followed by 3 jets and several more inthe area at the time","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-11292013-0027","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.766763","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","City":"Jefferson","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.766763,+-94.337423(52511)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52511) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/29/2013 11:59 UTC","Object Features":"None"}
