There was a pulsating rumbling (on and off like a heart beat) that woke him and he looked out the window. The plane had the strangest green lighting pattern on it - he's never seen before. It flew over the house and then over the trees across the road. He suddenly saw small glowing balls of light dropping out of the plane to the ground. When I woke up and looked out he pointed to a small glowing light across the road in a field. It glowed for a few minutes (not pulsing, a steady glowing) and then it suddenly faded out."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Maryland","Date of the Event":"04/21/2011 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Strange plane with green lights dropping balls of lights to ground","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28741.html"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Monkton","There were no other sightings in Monkton on or around April 21st 2011"],"Log Number":"US-04212011-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"04/21/2011 03:21 UTC","Latitude":"39.585041","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-76.614333"}
