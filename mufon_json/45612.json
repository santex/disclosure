I am a skeptical person and was trying to figure out what it could be, all I know it was not a bird,bat airplane,helicopter satellite, meteor, flying rubbish. The weather was clear sky, no wind, no moon light. As we were looking if we could see the object again, my wife spotted a dark shadowy human figure standing in the middle of the street staring in our direction, we quickly went in the house and locked the door, the streetlight was not functioning at that time."],"City":"camden","Region":"England","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.551706,+-0.158826(45612)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45612) map </A>","Object Shape":"Diamond"}
