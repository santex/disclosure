We opened the curtain, wasn't raining nor did a car pass by. We ran outside, looked to the north and there were two objects floating. Not near or anything, but in plain view. One stayed in the same spot and disappeared. The other came closer. As it came near us it got brighter and disappeared. It's been awhile since we've seen anything and its a bit unsettling."]}
