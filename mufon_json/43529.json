There was no sound, and there were no lights associated with the object. It seemed that the object was fairly low in the atmosphere, no more than 500 ft, and there were no lights from the ground that reflected off the base of the object. The object moved fairly quickly, faster than an airplane or a helicopter. The object seemed to move from horizon to horizon, with a slight arc to the west. The object seemed to be triangular in shape."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"10/26/2012 01:07 UTC","City":"Perryton","Latitude":"36.398252"}
