{"divs":["Sighting Detailswe were downtown and i looked up and thought i was looking at a plane but the object was to close to the ground and to small to be a plane. it looked like two crafts about two inches apart and each had two white lights on them they moved very slow much slower than a plane and they turned and moved across the sky while keeping the same distance between them. we chased them for a while as they moved just above the first level of the low hanging storm clouds they would reappear at times but eventually the clouds got to heavy to see it. we saw many other planes in the sky that night and none of them came even remotely close to looking like what we saw in the sky earlier."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.564996,+-83.617437(18274)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18274) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.564996","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"18274","Date Submitted":"07/23/2009 09:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-07242009-0008","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-83.617437","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18274.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18274.html"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Perrysburg","There were no other sightings in Perrysburg on or around July 23rd 2009"],"Summary":"two crafts two lights each","City":"Perrysburg","Date of the Event":"07/23/2009 09:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
