At first I looked to see if there where anything in my lens, or if there was a bird close to me, but there were nothing. Puting zoom on the picture, I became confused. I don't have any additional information, I didn't see anything at the time, for me everything was normal. It was a bird? Could you help me to understand? I don't have answers, unfortunatly. That's why I���m asking your help. I expect to recieve your return. Thank you.
