At 9:03pm we saw a huge flash of light in the southern sky that seemed to fill the whole horizon. It was brief but bright enough for us to wonder about its origin. The sky was perfectly clear. I've been checking the news but there are no reports of anything unusual. By chance I tried this website (I assumed it was some sort of natural phenomenon) and was surprised to find another witness in Ontario reporting a similiar occurrence around the same time. I suspect we were both seeing the same phenomena."],"Summary":"Flash of light in southern sky.","Longitude":"-78.875479","Case Number":"19654","Date Submitted":"09/26/2009 12:42 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/25/2009 09:03 UTC"}
