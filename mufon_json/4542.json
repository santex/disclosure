Object moved very erratically in triangular flight paths. Rapid short bursts of movement at extremely sharp angles of change of direction indicated this was to me a possible UFO. Odd thing was that ten to fifteen antenna gradually migrated out of the main body of the vehicle. Object had the appearance of a spider when antenna were fully extended. Antennae were about 5 times longer than the main vehicle. Antennae gradually withdrew and vehicle vaporized away."],"Date of the Event":"03/04/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"star like object , spider like appendages migrating gradually out of the main body vehicle.","Country":"United States","City":"Marietta","Case Number":"4542","Log Number":"US-03142006-0002","Date Submitted":"03/04/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
