There were no lights, no sound and it was traveling very fast. The first thing I thought it was, was a UFO. I immediately told my husband to look and we both watched it for at least 15 seconds. It looked like a cloudy, misty disc shaped object flying at what appeared to be a 45 degree angle. It looked like it was the color of the sky but you could see the outline of it clearly, like it had some sort of cloaking ability. For as low as it was and how fast it was going, there were absolutely no lights and zero sound. We watched it head west towards the ocean, then it just suddenly descended straight down. Even if we were to video tape it, I don't believe it would have showed up on the camera. Not this one!"]}
