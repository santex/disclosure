It was about 4:30pm. I was watching the sky, trying to find something to do while I waited. Suddenly, I noticed an object in the sky. I didn't know what it was. It appeared to be an oval or cigar, but based on the distance I could have been a disk. It appeared to be spinning and reflecting the sunlight off its surface. The sunlight prevented me from seeing the actual surface of the craft, but it was a clear day with plenty of sun, so I know I did not imagine the object. After a few minutes, it slowly faded away. After it was gone, I looked to see if anyone else had been watching it. No one else seemed to have noticed, so I kept it to myself, wondering if I had really just seen something supernatural."],"Summary":"A Cigar shaped metallic craft hovered through the air as I watched.","Date Submitted":"10/18/2011 05:58 UTC","Region":"Maryland"}
