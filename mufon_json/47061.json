I was about ten years old. It looked very much like a UFO cartoon with two deep plates put together and a small plate on top. There was round windows all the way around a the center of the two plates and around the small plate on top. It never appeared really solid, and when I began thinking to get a camera it vanished, it had no color. I would say diameter was approx 8meters and 4meters high. The construction appeared to be to small to fit humans. At least that was my thought at that time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"12.604946","Summary":"UFO materialised and dematerialised in my garden.","City":"Charlottenlund","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47061.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47061.html"],"Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"55.76051","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
