It was a clear night, and unseasonably warm for December. In the sky north of Benton I saw a orb of light descend quickly towards the ground. It moved at a speed which is unlike I have ever seen any typical aircraft. The light was a solid bright yellow, and had to be within a mile from where I was standing. The craft moved rapidly down, and abruptly stopped still above a tree line. It wasn't too far from the ground when it stopped, probabley 50' above the trees. The aircraft then flashed slightly brighter, and disappeared. No noise. No trail. It vanished."],"Case Number":"14723","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.568797,+-92.582098(14723)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14723) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Arkansas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01032009-0015","Summary":"A brightly lit craft descends rapidly, and disappears.","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"01/03/2009 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14723.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14723.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Benton","There were no other sightings in Benton on or around January 3rd 2009"],"Source":"MUFON"}
