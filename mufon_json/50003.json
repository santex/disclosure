{"Latitude":"40.413123","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsSunday, August 18th 2013 (Approx. 9:15pm) My girlfriend and I were driving south on Bel Aire Drive. I came to the stop sign at the intersection of Manor Road when I immediately saw three very bright red-orange orbs in the sky directly infront of me. I cannot be sure their altitude or size but they were certainly above the tree line and below the clouds. The orbs were arranged in a triangular formation and remained still during my observation. It was rather cloudly out and no other stars could be observed (They were by far the brightest thing in the sky). The orbs appeared to be hovering right above Route 22. After watching for a minute or two I made a right turn onto Manor Drive and my girlfriend looked back and could no longer see them as if they had vanished."],"Date of the Event":"08/18/2013 09:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08192013-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50003.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50003.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Delmont","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Delmont","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"50003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.413123,+-79.57032(50003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50003) map </A>","Summary":"Three bright red-orange orbs in triangular formation","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/19/2013 10:46 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Triangle","Longitude":"-79.57032","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
