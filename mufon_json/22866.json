{"Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailsi went to the window & few min. later in the southern part of sky & very low over the lake , a flash caught my eye & i've looked in that area & there it showed up again & at extreme speed it went in a back & forth motion , like side to side (se to sw) . this repeated it self 5 times . wasn't rhythmic , more like 2 times i had to wait & see if it would re-appear again . after the last quick glide towards the west , it just stopped & while still looking in that direction , all of a sudden i in a nick of time saw on the left side of my eye a lot less weaker flush of light ball & than all was over . i've waited few minutes , but it has not reappeared . before writting this report here i have checked the maps of where exactly it must have been , & judging by the distance it must have been on the american side , somewhere over the pensilvania -ohio corridor . i'm sure someone there must have seen it as it was huge ! the size of the ball\\flush light seemed to be as big as a moon . the aureola of the light or edge rim was very wide & a bit fuzzy . as for the distance it must have 'travelled' like this for many miles . this whole sighting lasted about 3-4 min, i estimate . have no idea of what it could have been . while looking at this i felt some pressure at the temples but i think it was due to my trying to keep up with it as to not losing it from my view , plus it was in the middle of the night . time it happened was at approx. 12:35 am - 12:38 am. no photos available ."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.380194","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.657396,+-79.380194(22866)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22866) map </A>","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around April 17th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22866.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22866.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"43.657396","Case Number":"22866","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Strange very large white flash light going back & forth , as if looking for something , in a low horizon perhaps 25* angle to the horizon & over the lake but it looked much much further as if over the Lake Erie on the US side (direct South).","Date of the Event":"04/17/2010 01:00 UTC","Country":"Canada","Region":"Ontario","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Toronto","Log Number":"CA-04172010-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/17/2010 01:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
