Kept talking thru it while sitting on my back porch. Looking up at the sky I see a star that is larger than other stars moving in a straight line not moving that fast but at a steady pace. Thought it was a plane but had no blinking lights. Just kind of bright. Hung up the phone, called my wife and son outside to look. Tried using the camera on my phone but it did not show up on film. Soon it was out of sight and not even a minute passes by and the on to AWACs plane (the one with the radar dish on top) comes from the left at a low altitude. My reaction was : what the f*ck ?! And I go back in the house for the night !! Maybe a sattelite ? No clue !! A few co-workers have seen strange things flying that were right overhead that were silent but just made a buzzing sound."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-122.231753","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.387184,+-122.231753(41926)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41926) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"41926","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"08/22/2012 02:05 UTC","City":"Kent","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Latitude":"47.387184"}
