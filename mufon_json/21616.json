(the positions\\angles of the two objects wouldn't have matched in a reflection, in my opinion). could it even have been a large solid sphere reflecting the streetlights at the bottom and not the top? oddly enough, i saw another sky phenomenon from the same place, in november or december 2009, a meteor, but not like any i've ever seen before, close and slow moving with twin tails, a bright spot in front and the trails were a golden color. i was the only witness to it that i know of. the reason i noticed the orange glow is that now i'm in the habit of looking at the sky from there after seeing the \"meteor\" back then. by the way, my boyfriend is a real skeptic and even he thought the orange glow was bizarre. i have had a few other odd experiences, dreams or sightings over the years, all different."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","Date of the Event":"01/23/2010 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21616.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21616.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Weymouth","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.227583,+-70.935118(21616)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21616) map </A>","Summary":"dusky orangehalf-visible orb or sphere in northern sky, very large, 1/4 inch at arm's length","Date Submitted":"01/24/2010 10:29 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-70.935118","Latitude":"42.227583"}
