(if accurate, is one of the most amazing sightings in Colorado, but seems to be unknown. I don't know why this could be because it was high profile with official witnesses. maybe it was hushed up) My cousin Alan Day, then about 14 years old, was sent out by his dad (Frank Day)in the day time to a storage shed to retrieve something. When he went outside he witnessed a triangular ufo above his property. This was in close proximity to an electrical power plant adjacent to the farm. The farm was south of Johnstown a few miles. When the father also saw the ufo, he called the sheriffs department, and an officer showed up quickly and also witnessed the craft. The craft then slowly began to move parallel to the ground and away from the area. The sheriff got in his car and tried to follow the craft along the highway but was unable as the craft picked up speed and left the area. Have you had any reports on this event? If so could you please contact me back. Thank You. James S. Reynolds"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1974 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
