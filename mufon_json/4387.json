{"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-104.980913","divs":["Sighting DetailsAT 10:30 pm I was sitting on my balcony, smoking a cigarette. Just happened to look up and noticed a boomerang shaped object heading south. There were no lights and no sound coming from it. It did reflect light though which was why I noticed it. At first I thought it was a stealth jet, then realized that it was too wide and not shaped quite right for that. I lost sight of it as it went over the top of the house. I just went in, jotted it all down in my journal and went to bed. Didn't report it soner because I don't want to be considered one of the looney people."],"Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Log Number":"US-02062006-0002","City":"Denver","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"4387","Date of the Event":"10/02/2005 10:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.745354,+-104.980913(4387)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4387) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Summary":"lookd up and noticed a boomerang shaped object, no lights, no sound","Date Submitted":"10/02/2005 10:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There was one other sighting in Denver on or around October 2nd 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4387.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4387.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.745354"}
