Me, my wife and son were in the backyard in the swimming pool (open yard, no screen) watching the fireworks all around the neighborhood. Very clear night had good view of stars even with the full moon well almost full there was like a tiny bit on the side still in shadow like 1%. Everything looked pretty good from our view we can see in all directions and low in the horizon. My wife said OHH look at that one, I turned and looked and before I could say anything she was like oh that���������s weird. When I 1st looked at it I thought maybe someone close by maybe a few blocks away had shot a flare off. Then I realized what I was seeing was no flare just by the way it was moving. It was moving from a west to east or NE maybe but flew right over our heads then I thought it was a missile maybe, my wife said it���������s a UFO, my son said maybe it���������s a comet maybe. I know a little about astronomy and have a powerful telescope so I knew it wasn���������t a plane or comet its speed was that of maybe a satellite or a little faster going by. we watched it go over head and towards the east till we couldn���������t see it no more it looked like a mini sun orange in color was very bright when we 1st seen it then faded as it moved away. I���������d say it's size was well bigger then Venus or any of the brightest stars you could see with the naked eye but not to much bigger. We all decided it was a UFO and thought how lucky we were to see it together. Fact we really thought it was awesome and none of us were or became afraid. This is not the 1st time my wife and I have seen something of this nature but that is another story. This is the 1st time we ever reported made a report or anything. I feel it's time to tell the people of the world the truth. we can handle it. were HUMAN BEINGS we can handle anything. Thank You."]}
