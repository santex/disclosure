When i looked out my back window and saw a light appear. Im always looking outside because ive seen other lights in the past. So i kept starring at it and said to myself, \"If that light does ANYTHING unusual, im grabbing my phone... and thats when i saw the light do a fast turn to the left, then straight up into the sky and dimmed out, then got really really bright red... hovered, then dropped really fast.. thats when i ran out of my back door and shot video of the light."]}
