It seemed to slightly wave back and forth, but it was not a balloon. It then moved in a straight line east-ward, and after about five minutes, moved straight up again. We took a picture of it, and upon magnification it seems to be divided into three sections. (See attached image) We were in downtown Toronto (Leslieville area), ON Canada, on Saturday, Sept 19, 2009 at approximately 2:00pm. We saw the object for approx 10 minutes in total."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19394_submitter_file1__sept192009.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19394.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"White (or metallic) egg-like shape in sky, with possibly 3 sections, moving up, then east, then up again","Case Number":"19394","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Unknown","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around September 19th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Egg, Teardrop","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 02:41 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.657016,+-79.377784(19394)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19394) map </A>","Region":"Ontario","City":"Toronto","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 12:00 UTC"}
