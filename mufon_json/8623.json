Spiraling, zig-zaging, dropping and picking back up quickly behind the trees. It pulsed red, orange, green, blue, gold, white randomly and dimmed and pulsed every once in a while. Video camera wouldn't pick it up, though through binoculars it had a spherical shape to it and seemed to have a white light on top of whatever it was. After moving alot for about 30 to 40 minutes, it stopped suddenly and dimmed a little to where it seemed like an ordinary star, but it picked back up about 25 minutes later and started moving again, though not as much as before. We watched it until it went to the horizen and went out of sight in the southeast direction from where we were standing."],"Weather Factors":"None","Region":"South Carolina","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8623.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8623.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/17/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-12172007-0001","City":"Seneca","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Seneca","There were no other sightings in Seneca on or around December 17th 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"8623"}
