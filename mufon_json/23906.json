So as we were watching this one plane my wife notices another object and asks me what it is. It was directly overhead, can't determine the altitude, but probably cloud level. It was a long cigar shaped object, about the size of an airliner but possibly bigger. What caught our attention was the fact that it made no noise and had no wings that we could see. It made a slow and deliberate path that seemed slower than a plane - moving West to East. I thought it might be an illusion due to the lighting with the sun beginning to set, but after a minute or so the object just disappeared like it became one with the sky - that is, there was no burst of speed or anything, all of a sudden it was just gone."],"Summary":"Cigar shaped object over Washtenaw County.","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Michigan","Date Submitted":"06/23/2010 01:42 UTC","City":"Salem","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-83.58","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
