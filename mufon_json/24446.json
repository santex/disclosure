I can only guess it was the same or same type of object as reported before because I could not see any detail of the object itself except for the flame coming out from the bottom. The darkness of the night sky prevented me from seeing the object itself. it was traveling from the southwest to the northeast direction. I viewed this object for approximately 3 or 4 minutes before I could no longer see it across the railroad tracks and an open field. When I came back upstairs I noticed it was 9:45 p.m. Its rate of speed appeared to be about 5 m.p.h."],"Log Number":"US-07112010-0025","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"La Porte","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24446.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24446.html"],"Summary":"Sphere emitting flame seen again.","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.610607,+-86.71504(24446)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24446) map </A>"}
