After downloading the pictures I found the five balls of light in just one picture. I didn't see them when I took it. They're not stars because you can see the clouds in the background. They're not raindrops illuminated by the flash on my camera as I've seen in other pictures because the tree limbs about 50 feet away partly block the second one from the bottom and the bottom one is framed by the tree limbs about 100 feet away. The camera used was a Vivicam 3785 3.0 megapixel. I searched sites on ball lightning and pearl lightning but this looks like neither of them."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/15/2005 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-85.675554","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4830.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4830_submitter_file1__5balls11-15-05.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4830.html"]}
