{"Region":"Massachusetts","Viewing Distance":"N/A","divs":["Sighting Detailsi downloaded a computer telescope software to look at the night sky and noticed around 10 simular objects all over the sky.they are very huge in plain sight. they are round with channels cut into them like different levels or something and one of the objects seems to have a smaller object entering it. and on another you can see those same objects parked on one of the floors of the bigger ship and in another it looks like 2 might be powered up because they are emmitiing a bright light source. so to make sure these same objects appear on another program i crossed refrenced the locations and sure enough the same object on both programs from different telescopes. so these are real and there very close and very big. please contact me and i will give you the locations of these things so you can look for yourself. here is the proof!"],"Object Flight Path":"N/A","City":"Boston","Longitude":"-71.052653","Latitude":"42.365811","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35774.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35774.html"],"Case Number":"35774","Date of the Event":"02/12/2012 05:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02132012-0113","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"i downloaded a computer sky telescope program and found about ten simular shaped object all over the place. these things must be some type of mothership or moon sized artificial planets","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Boston","There was one other sighting in Boston on or around February 12th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.365811,+-71.052653(35774)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35774) map </A>","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Date Submitted":"02/13/2012 12:55 UTC","Tags":"City"}
