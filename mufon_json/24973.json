The roof garden is on top of a 2-story building. The position of the light from my vantage point was directly east of Ocean Drive and 12th Street in South Beach, Florida. To the left of the almost-full moon was a stationary blue light that was blinking. Then next time I saw it blinking it had dropped and proceeded to drop then go to the right under the moon. When it was to the right of the moon, it started dropping again until it was under the tree line. I never saw it move; I only saw it blink then each subsequent time it was blinking, it was in a different position. The whole event lasted 10 minutes. Did anyone else see it?"]}
