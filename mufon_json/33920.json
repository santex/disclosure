While getting lost I noticed over a field area some strange lights at first I though it was a plane but it had 3 sometimes 4 white lights on it. They would come off and on in a pattern and a couple of times went out completely. This objected looked to be hovering and descending down slowly. I have no idea what was over that way and didn't want to find out! I pulled off and watched it a couple of minutes and I rolled down the window but didn't hear a sound. I got my gas and jumped back on the interstate and headed home! I don't know what that object was but I never seen something that large not make some kind of noise and the light pattern was not like a plane or heli."],"Date Submitted":"12/09/2011 12:38 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33920.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33920.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/08/2011 09:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":[],"Case Number":"33920","Summary":"Object with 3 or 4 white lights hovering Coffee Co.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
