They were as bright as a planet is at night, I would say as bright as Venus even. They moved slowly in various directions. I took a video camera out to the front of the home and video taped a few minutes of the event, using a tripod as well for a brief time for a stable shot. The objects moved slowly east over the ocean until they were out of sight approx. 45 minutes later. There was other witnesses besides me and we all were asking what they were."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36721.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36721.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-77.878129","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/25/2012 09:09 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"5 daytime objects glowing moving slowly across the sky.","Latitude":"34.19927","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"10/24/1998 05:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 96 other sightings in Wilmington","There were no other sightings in Wilmington on or around October 24th 1998","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"36721","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"North Carolina"}
