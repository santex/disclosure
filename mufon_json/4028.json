Coincidence? (Story attached below) Apparently my job performance as a senior executive was not an issue since I was given a very nice letter of recommendation from my boss that reiterated my many accomplishments at work. However, when I asked why they wanted me to leave, I was merely told it was a \"fit\" issue. So maybe someone can tell me, where exactly do abductees fit in? I don't know what bothered them more...my family's story or the fact that it was delivered by a senior executive."],"Case Number":"4028","Log Number":"US-10252005-0001","Summary":"Marketing Director shares abduction story at work and shortly after gets canned.","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Palm Desert","There were no other sightings in Palm Desert on or around May 25th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"05/25/2005 10:05 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4028.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4028_submitter_file1__familyspread.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4028_submitter_file2__familyspreadpg3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4028.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.728794","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.728794,+-116.365756(4028)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4028) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/25/2005 10:05 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
