To my surprise when I put my pictures on the computer it was there. At first glance you think you're looking at a stray cloud, but then it moves so quickly you know it's not.I had watched it go over the mountain with no sound, and this is not the only one I've seen. There are so many here I keep my camera close by in case there is another sighting. A few days ago I watched one larger then this one going across from my Father in laws place. I am a sky watcher, and I know what I saw was not anything we have in the looks or a plane. There were no wings, and no noise. In the photograph there are more then one, and they seem to be studying the mountain, very strange! This is usually caught at night, as I have one from a night photo."],"Latitude":"38.13622","Longitude":"-81.099548","City":"Ansted","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.13622,+-81.099548(26160)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26160) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Windy","Date Submitted":"10/28/2010 04:31 UTC"}
