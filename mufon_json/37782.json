{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details3 weeks ago I saw 2 unkowns, one then the other, traveling west to east, then I was one unknown travel from north to south, all of which were beyond our atmosphere. Then I observed a light at about 1500-2000 ft travel from west to east. it was a lot brighter than any star, and I could easily tell that it was flying low. Then for the next three weeks I observed the same light staying stationary over Modesto from my house, it would show up at dark, and would usally leave after 10. I and my grandaughters saw it one night and I also have two pictures that I took."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Riverbank","There were no other sightings in Riverbank on or around April 18th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-04272012-0015","Latitude":"37.724197","Date Submitted":"04/27/2012 05:08 UTC","Region":"California","Case Number":"37782","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Riverbank","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Summary":"I watched it for 3 weeks","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37782.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37782.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.724197,+-120.94361(37782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37782) map </A>","Longitude":"-120.94361","Date of the Event":"04/18/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
