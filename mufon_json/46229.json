(he lives next door) it came back around 9:30pm 3\\14\\13, i was texting a friend when i saw it in the same window so i quickly started taking pictures, with my cell phone. i took approx 50 pic's from all different angles an with it turning it's head. i even got pictures of what appeared to be cloaking itself. very scary!!! i am still freaked out an i didn't get much sleep last night. i had a feeling it was trying to lure me to the door, it was reptilian, it had eyes similar to the grey alien everyone talks of but it had scales on it's head and it's shoulders. it also had bony spike shapes over his skull an all i saw were 3 fingers. it was approx 7 feet tall and looked strong. it just stared directly in my eyes, when i moved, his head moved. when his head turned i saw wrinkles on his neck, his nose was flat an he had no lips, \"more like a lizard\" it appeared to have projected images onto the glass, an was shape shifting! i know how this sounds, but i'm serious. he made a black spot appear in the center of his face an the spot looked like a beak(maybe owl) then he shifted into what looked like a clown with a gift in it's hands an the other that mostly freaked me out appeared to be of an old man (possible priest) an when it smiled the priest smiled too. i could tell it was just a projection on to the glass, because i could still clearly see him. i know how this sounds, as i hesitated telling anyone...but i have great pictures and a video that i took with my cell phone. i called my landlord over to share the story an pictures, he is a well known local animal veterinarian. he studied the pictures an they also freaked him out. he said he won't walk his dog at night any longer. he explained what he saw in the photos that i took, an is very interested in learning about what i have witnessed. i do not know who to call or if i should call anyone, i have many pictures of it's face changing shapes an very good pictures of the structures of it's eyes, scales, an head. i don't know how to take the images from my cell or i would email you a few, i can text the images. i am a bit scared from what i have seen, if you have any idea of what it was please contact me an tell me what i can do to keep it away. i am going to the local humane society to get a dog or two, i hope that will help. if your interested in talking, you may reach me on my cell: 360-451-8840 but please don't tell anyone my name. i volunteer for the state of washington an don't want this to interfere with my job or my friends and family. i attached a few pictures of it shape shifting, a couple of the pictures are of it turning into what looked like a clown face, an the last image, you can clearly see it's head (left) an it projecting a image of the old mans head (right) i have many more images. i hung curtains up today, so if it comes back tonight i will not be able to see it."],"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.044724,+-122.893915(46229)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46229) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/14/2013 09:50 UTC","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Olympia","There were no other sightings in Olympia on or around March 14th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"I took approx 50 pic's of an alien looking in my backdoor window","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.893915","Case Number":"46229","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"47.044724","Date Submitted":"03/15/2013 11:23 UTC","Object Flight Path":"N/A"}
