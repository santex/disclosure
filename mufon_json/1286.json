After a while I saw what looked exacly like a sataliteand we began to watch it. But it did not behave as a satalite. It would slowdown, and then speed up. It would make incredible leaps across the sky, only tostop instantly and begin to swirl in some lazy pattern. Its movements madeabsolutely no sense at all. Sometimes it would just stop entirely, and we wouldloose it among the stars until it decided to start moving again. We watched itfor about 30 minutes, and then others started joining it, all coming fromdifferent directions. In the end, there were 5 of them, all doing the same kindof sensless dance. We wathced them all for at least 3 hours until we finallygot bored of them doing nothing else, and we fell asleep. Kind of a boringsighting I suppose, but I would love to hear any explanation that you may have. Thanks much."],"Date of the Event":"Unknown","Longitude":"-111.694648","Log Number":"","Latitude":"40.296898","Summary":"saw what looked like dancing or swirling stars","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Orem","There were no other sightings in Orem on or around"],"Region":"Utah","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"1286","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Orem","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.296898,+-111.694648(1286)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1286) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1286.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1286.html"],"Tags":"City"}
