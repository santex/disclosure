It was very cold out and the sky was 100% clear. I was traveling threw Hinsdale when i looked out the driver side window of my car and saw a bright light in the sky Hovering over the houses at 12:40am. After a glance i looked again and saw that it was cigar shaped glowing white. There were 3-4 small blue lights on it and one big blue light at the bottom end of it that was pulsing. It hovered for a few seconds then drifted in my direction, but then made a slow turn to the north east. After another moment it raced off to the horizon, at which point it stopped. The road dipped down in elevation after a bridge and i lost sight of the object behind the tree line. After the racing off part it looked like a faint star in the sky. I was almost instantly hit with a huge adrenaline rush when i realized what was hovering over the houses. I felt a little scared for a moment, very very shocked. Never thought i would ever see anything like this."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"12/05/2008 01:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/05/2008 01:00 UTC","City":"Hinsdale","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12052008-0008","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.937005"}
