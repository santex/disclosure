{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving slowly going under I-65S on a local road with my wife. It was about 10:20pm, since that was the time I saw shortly after the event. As we came out from under I-65 I noticed a yellowish flaming ball in the sky on the driver's side in front of us. It was motionless like a star. Fireworks were going off ocassionally. But what made this event stand out was the large size about the size of a bluberry. The duration was about 1 minute, and it was covered with flames moving in an upward direction, like if you hold a piece of paper and burn it the flame flows up to the sky. It at first was steady but its size being too large for any fireworks and the fact it was burnig as if on fire but orb with flames not as an explosion or flare. It pulsed aftered I showed my wife and got dimmer then noticablely brighter, then dimmer, and gone. It was amazing!"],"Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/07/2010 07:48 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.773756,+-86.151544(24330)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24330) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.151544","Latitude":"39.773756","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24330.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24330.html"],"Region":"Indiana","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/05/2010 10:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-07072010-0031","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Spotted yellow flame like orb about size of a blueberry near I-65S from 38th St.","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There was one other sighting in Indianapolis on or around July 5th 2010"],"City":"Indianapolis","Case Number":"24330","Disposition":"Unknown"}
