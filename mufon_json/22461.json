my guess is they are still exposing more and more people to their presence. i cannot support the idea that this was a hologram or military drone. but why continue with the shell game? it's time to engage in more direct communications with these entities. the disclosure is up to \"we the people\"! let's just hope they have are here to help, because we have little to no chance if they are here to take us over. i will agree to third party release if i am given all information on to whom it is being given. mufon can be quite frustrating to work with sometimes and i cannot say i fully trust who is behind the scenes working with this info! side note: i obviously would have preferred to have my camera at the ready, but i didn���������t expect to have this sighting. i did video tape another jet bta2278 on a very similar flight path about 20 minutes later, but didn���������t capture any anomalies that i am aware. that flight data is almost identical: 05:37pm 41.12 -96.08 17������ north 281 323 0.48 6,500 -1,020 minneapolis center 05:37pm 41.15 -96.07 9������ north 279 321 0.48 6,300 -1,020 minneapolis center 05:38pm 41.20 -96.06 17������ north 277 319 0.48 5,500 -1,020 minneapolis center 05:39pm 41.28 -96.03 16������ north 263 303 0.45 4,500 -1,020 minneapolis center"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/23/2010 03:44 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Disc craft \"escorts\" commercial jet","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around March 22nd 2010"],"Case Number":"22461","Latitude":"41.255083","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22461.html"],"City":"Omaha","Longitude":"-95.990538","Log Number":"US-03232010-0010","Date of the Event":"03/22/2010 05:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Nebraska"}
