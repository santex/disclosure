Everyone else in the house was snug in their beds. Noone was stirring. I went out in my cap and gown[no comments please], and what did I see? A large carriage careening through the air, being propelled by 8 conscripted forest creatures with antlers. Their eyes seemed to suggest some sort of Magic Dust ingestion. The Alien[legal?...can't say] carriage operator appeared to be wearing a large fur-trimmed red spacesuit. They proceeded to land upon residential roofs and invading the houses through the HVAC combustion output ventilation systems. I am very afraid.....can you assist?
