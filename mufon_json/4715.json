{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"4715","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn September 1, 2005, a friend of mine and I were taking a joy ride on a motor boat rented from the nearby Chain O'Lakes State Park in northern Illinois in the afternoon. The weather was perfect and we took lots of pictures. We didn't observe anything unusual then, but while reviewing those pictures a couple of days ago, we got puzzled by two dark spots on one of them. After magnifying those spots, we were struck by their unusual shapes. If those were man made and placed there that time, we would have noticed them and probably phothographed at a much closer range. Attached find the original, unaltered digital photo, along with two spots that we magnified for better viewing. You be the judge."],"Log Number":"US-04262006-0003","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.879414","Longitude":"-87.623958","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Chicago","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around September 1st 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"09/01/2005 04:47 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.879414,+-87.623958(4715)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4715) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4715.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4715_submitter_file1__DSCN1061.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4715_submitter_file2__Magnified1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4715_submitter_file3__Magnified2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4715.html"],"Region":"Illinois","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/01/2005 04:47 UTC","Summary":"UFOs discovered on a picture taken over Grass Lake","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
