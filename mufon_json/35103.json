It was about 2-2:30 AM Starry night. I observed a very lager UFO moving north. I noticed the object when my vehical stopped running. I got out to see what the problem might be and to my left and up I noticed the stars were not visible. I started looking and noticed a very large slow moving object. It was about 500 ft to 1 mile away. It was a shape of a delta wing, but the front or nose was cut off flat. It was about 1000 ft across and length of 3-400 ft. no lights, sound. This vehical was way too large to be moving that slow and still flying. It continued north towards Ridgecrest until it was out of sight over the mountains.The siting lasted about 10-15 minutes. My vehical started and I continued to work, I asked coworkers if anyone had seen anything, they had not."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35103.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35103.html"],"Longitude":"-117.537483","Log Number":"US-01242012-0018","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Latitude":"34.99493","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"01/24/2012 12:07 UTC","Tags":"City"}
