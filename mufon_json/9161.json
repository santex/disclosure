and cut well below the level of the power lines in the other break area...again with no branches or trees down. as stated, only the center lines were impacted and were spliced\\bridged in short order. more than that cannot be relayed, due to cloud cover. it should be mentioned that no local transformers were tripped during the incident and no lightning was reported that night. furthermore, it was strange in that most of our neighbors were awakened by the light and that it was a strange enough occurence to merit discussion across the community about our 'little green visitors'. evidently, few others thought it was lightning. shortly after the incident occured, nb power took down 3 complete grids, affecting more than 1100 homes in the area, on the pretext that there was only a single power control point to deactivate in order to facilitate repairs...and this long before any crews would have responded. and no trees across the lines (at least in our area). curious and leaves me wishing it was a clear night! photos were taken of the repair areas, showing the splices done by the crews and the ground under and around the breaks. they can be provided, but do not show the crews in action, or any great detail. the only thing they show is no material of any sort impacting the lines. finally, being ex-military, i am well aware that there is powerful aew equipment on modified hercules and other large aircraft that can easily disrupt local power if 'lit-off' by accident. however, i'd be inclined to think that any kind of surge from that equipment would have messed with transformers as well... that's all i have to report. come to your own conclusions, and if you're a 'local' you can now rest assured that 'yes...someone else saw what you saw.'"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9161.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9161.html"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Fredericton","Latitude":"45.96941"}
