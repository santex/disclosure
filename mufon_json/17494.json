I seen a black object in the sky in the distance. It was moving towards me under the clouds. I live near the airport, so at first thought of it as an airplane. When the object got closer I knew it wasn't a plane! I thought maybe a baloon or a huge bird, but as it got even closer I knew it was something else. Then it got right above me and could see it was a black circle shaped thing! It was no plane, bird, or baloon! It traveled from the north, moving south then southeast. When it got right above me I ran to get my husband, when we came back outside in a matter of seconds, it was on the other side of the house (front). My husband witnessed the same object but at a further distance. It appeared at moments as if it were tilting back and forth. As we watched it for about another minute or so it began to rise into the clouds out of sight. Wonder if anyone else had seen the same object that morning....."]}
