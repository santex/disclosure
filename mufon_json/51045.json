He said he could see these orange lights flying over his neighborhood and wondered if I could see them from where I was (I live close by in a different neighborhood.) I couldn't see anything in that direction, so I hopped in my car and headed to his house (approx 4-5 minute trip). Before reaching his house, I could see two of the orange, glowing orbs overhead. They seemed low flying, maybe a few hundred feet above the houses. Once I was at his house, we saw 3-4 more traveling in the same direction. They followed almost the exact same path each time, coming one at a time and traveling out towards the bay. Before I arrived, he said he saw about 20-30, some moving in pairs, slowing down, stopping and then continuing on. The whole event lasted about 10-15 minutes after I arrived. I have a somewhat low quality video taken on my phone of an object in motion. They were moving at a constant speed, neither very fast or very slow."],"Summary":"Many orange orbs flying in a straight path.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Toms River","There were no other sightings in Toms River on or around September 22nd 2013"],"Case Number":"51045","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51045.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51045.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/24/2013 02:51 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
