They were too close together to be airplanes. And the color of them was like no airplane I've ever seen. They were fairly low right above a bunch of huge trees. I kept my eye on them while driving and stared for about 8 minutes until I was close to home when I went to get my parents to tell them to come see. I reasoned out all the possibilities, they werent airplanes and the werent light poles.About 5 minutes later after we all got in the car and drove back to the area where I saw them they were gone."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/04/2008 10:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-08052008-0012","Date Submitted":"08/04/2008 10:50 UTC","Latitude":"26.068286","Summary":"Around 10-12 lights in the sky very close together","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11940.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11940.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Davie","There were no other sightings in Davie on or around August 4th 2008"]}
