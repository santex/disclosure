{"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/02/2012 09:55 UTC","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsFirst let me say this event happened over 35 years ago (somewhere in the early 70's). My wife and I were returning to New York from Penn. via 95. It was approx. 8PM and dark. As we approached Wilmington on 495 we saw a lot of different lights in the sky in front of our car at approx. 300'-500' high. Now remember, we are traveling at 60mph on a multi-lane highway in the middle lane. Hard to stop. I remember there was a river to the right of the highway. As we approached the lights I could see the object was enormous. It filled the windshield with no visible end in any direction. No end to the mutitude of lights. As I drove it moved ever slow slowly to my right across the sky. It seemed to stand still. There was no sound we could hear over the car noise. The best discription I can give to the object comes from the movie \"Forth of July\". They had it right. It was a vertual city upside down. My wife and I accepted what we saw and kept on truckin. When one considers the great exspance of space, who would travel in a little saucer? We are telling our story now just for the record."],"Summary":"This event happened or 35 years ago.
