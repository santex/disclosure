{"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"09/03/2008 04:30 UTC","Summary":"Varying multi colored, sphere shaped, hovering object above tree line.","divs":["sighting detailson sept. 3, 2008, i was with camping with 4 other men in parkside bay on ragged lake, in algonquin provincial park. (near smoke lake sighting on aug. 19, 2008) i had awakened at 4:30 am, (reason unknown), and had made coffee over the fire. while it was cooking, i walked down to the lake to look at the stars since the sun had not come up yet. as i looked to the south, (approximately 1\\2 mile away), i noticed a large, bright, multiple colored, (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, with varying location), sphere shaped object flashing right on the treeline. this object spanned the width of at least 6 large pine trees directly below it. (i could see them silouetted below the object). i did not have a camera but my binoculars were in the canoe so i grabbed them to take a closer look. the object was definitely sphere shaped with alternating color patterns. as i watched, it arose and lowered in the sky, but never below the tree line. after about an hour it rose to a height of 100 to 150 feet above the trees but did not get smaller or travel along the trees in any direction. initially, i thought the object was an airplane or helicopter but soon realized there was no sound at all and the changes in the lights were not consistent with aircraft. after another 5 to 10 minutes i heard an airplane off to the west of the lake, at cruising altitude, moving much faster and much smaller than the object i was observing. the plane was gone from my sight within 5 minutes but the object remained for at least another 20 to 25 minutes without moving in any direction. i continued watching until faded from view with the lightening sky. during and after the sighting i felt i was watching some type of ufo and after speaking to a few people about it, i still feel i was being visited or observed for some reason. in addition, after relating this to my wife, she went on to the mufon site and we read about another similar sighting which took place north of smoke lake on aug. 19, 2008 at 10:14 pm. the reporters description seems to be very similar to my own in every way except duration. these two locations are relatively close to each other. within 10 miles. i would welcome contact from mufon as well as the other individual who had a sighting from this area to exchange information."],"Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Agonquin Prov.
