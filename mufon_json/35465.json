{"Latitude":"40.18538","Date Submitted":"02/04/2012 04:59 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile outside smoking a cigarette, I looked up at the sky and noticed the moon behind the clouds. As I watched the clouds passing in the north east direction, I noticed a giant puncture hole through the clouds perfectly shaped as a triagle. Soon after there was another hole about the same size with no defined shape. These were the only two holes in these clouds that clearly stood out from any normal clouds that I have ever seen. My opinion is that something either traveled up or down through the clouds displacing the cloud itself enough to leave such a defined shape. Note: The only light visible through the clouds was the light of the moon, except when I looked through the triangle, I could see the stars clearly. I saw this for 15 minutes as the clouds went by slowly before they drifted out of view, the triangle maintained its shape through out the sighting. I felt I should report this.
