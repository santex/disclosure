They look like stars but then they start getting brighter then dimmer. They will yhen start flashing red blue and sometimes green lights. We think they must be pretty high altitude because we can see them mive up down and in figure 8 patterns. Sometimes there's two or three and sometimes up toten. They usually form random patterns but once they made a circle and lately they have been making triangle formations, and different types of triangles. We think they may be drone testing by the air force here, or more. My roommate whith whom I've been watching them with has seen an unmarked white SUV going through town with guys dressed up in vests and had pistols holstered in plain view. He saw them at Tim Horton's and persued the vehicle to a secluded area of town and ended it. We think the government may be experimenting new technology here, or these crafts may be from another world."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47391.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47391.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/08/2013 10:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-79.448381","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in North Bay","There were no other sightings in North Bay on or around May 8th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.288966,+-79.448381(47391)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47391) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"CA-05132013-0016","City":"North Bay"}
