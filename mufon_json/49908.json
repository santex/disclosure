I have never seen anything in the sky like this. It was brighter than a star, but getting brighter and dimmer, brighter and dimmer.It was absolutely, positively stationary. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, I was fascinated and completely puzzled. I watched a few minutes, went in my house and got my camera, but all I got was 2 seconds of nothing, and no stills. I watched about 10 minutes, waiting for some movement, but all it did was eventually fade out. I posted about it on Facebook and two of my friends came up with GOCE (flaring satellite) but this was definitely stationary and quite bright."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49908.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49908.html"],"Longitude":"-73.523846","Latitude":"40.696156"}
