I was driving east when I noticed 4 bright lights to the north east approximately where O'Hare airport is. I thought the lights were exceptionally bright for an airplane. They were in a straight line. What drew my attention was the spacing of the lights. I studied to be an air traffic controller years ago and know something about the rules for spacing between commercial flights. I didn't think it strange even then assuming that the spacing appeared that way due ,possibly, to the angle of the approaching planes. They seemed very high for planes approaching the airport. I kept trying to convince myself that it was just a group of planes coming in to the airport but there was no flashing strobe. They seemed brighter than even the planes that were closer. There are always a lot of planes coming and going at the airport. I could easily tell them apart from the rest of the traffic in the sky. I kept watching and stopped at a stoplight. I watched to see if they were moving. They appeared to stay stationary. They never moved as I watched them while sitting at the light. I kept very still and tried to use the outsid edge of the mirror of my car to determine any movement at all. They didn't move. I don't think they were helicopters with so much traffic over O'Hare. I don't know for sure what I saw but it was not like anything I've seen before. I've lived in the area most of my life and I am use to seeing planes come and go in their routes to and from the airport. Someone else had to see this if I did. There had to be pilots that saw it tonight. I don't know what to think. I know what I saw though."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-87.623438","Latitude":"41.881514","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/02/2008 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14196.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14196.html"],"trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around December 2nd 2008"],"Log Number":"US-12022008-0013","Weather Factors":"Medium","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"Lights near O'Hare Airport different than planes.","Case Number":"14196","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/02/2008 12:00 UTC"}
