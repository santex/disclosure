We first spotted an orange orb floating directly over us and it caught our attentions. It was completely silent, (not even a hum) and pulsating like an object on fire. It floated slowly directly over us and until it disappeared several miles away. We rode our bikes towards it when we looked in the sky and saw another triangle formation of 4 glowing orbs slowly disappearing one after another. As we continued to ride, these objects kept appearing a disappearing about 7 times, anywhere from 2-4 orbs at a time. Sometimes they were close; other times further away. Each time they looked like they were floating upward in the air until they were gone. The lights were like nothing we have ever seen before. They were much brighter then planes or stars, and seemed to be pulsating. Take a look at all of our videos from two perspectives; some are good and some are not as clear. Don���t mind us freaking out a little in the videos���. It was very exciting and exhilarating."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07052013-0053","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Novi","There were no other sightings in Novi on or around July 4th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48677.html"],"Case Number":"48677","Summary":"Orand glowing orbs floating in triangle formation repetedly","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 11:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Novi","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.477351","Latitude":"42.501293","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path"}
